        <p>The best Fantasy football managers all understand that you need depth to survive the season. That's why identifying potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers should be a top priority as you begin your Fantasy football draft prep. Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield was the 24th quarterback off the board on average last season and had an overall Fantasy football ADP of 156.0, but was a fixture in your Fantasy football lineups by season's end. He finished as QB3 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and that's the sort of mid-to-late round value that can help you win a championship.</p><p>So who will be this year's Baker Mayfield and is capable of dramatically outperforming their draft position? A reliable set of live-updated 2025 Fantasy football rankings can ensure you're getting maximum value out of every pick. Before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=06162025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetssleepers" target="_blank">be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>Last year, the model accurately predicted that Bills running back James Cook would comfortably outperform his ADP (RB14). The result: Cook rushed for 1,009 yards and 16 touchdowns while adding 32 receptions for 258 yards and two more scores as a receiver. He finished as RB8 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and his maturation into a scoring threat cemented his status as a Fantasy football superstar.</p><p>The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.</p>
        

<p>The model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking. The 2025 Fantasy football PPR rankings and 2025 Fantasy football standard rankings update multiple times daily, so you're always getting the best Fantasy football advice.</p><p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=06162025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetssleepers" target="_blank">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III. He simply could not evade the injury bug in 2024, missing Weeks 2 and 3 due to an oblique, missing Weeks 14 and 15 due to a calf, and missing Weeks 17 and 18 due to an ankle. It was apparent that Walker was playing at less than full health as he averaged just 3.7 yards per carry after averaging 4.4 over his first two seasons. Even with that decrease in productivity and missing six games, he scored at least eight touchdowns for the third straight year.</p>
        

<p>Walker played 15 games in each of his first two seasons, so a return to good health can be expected, and Seattle appears to be moving towards a run-oriented offense. It moved on from vets Geno Smith, DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett, while the Seahawks took an offensive guard with their first-round pick, and then were the only team to select a fullback in the 2025 NFL Draft. After dropping to the RB29 last season, SportsLine's advanced model has lofty Fantasy football projections for Walker in 2025 and has him as a top-20 Fantasy running back.</p><p>Another sleeper that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: Bears wide receiver D.J. Moore. He's a known commodity with four 1,000-yard seasons to his name and 194 catches for 2,300 yards and 15 total touchdowns over his first two seasons in Chicago, but an improved offense means Moore could enjoy sleeper status in 2025.</p><p>The Bears hired Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as their head coach and the hope is that one of the league's most innovative offensive minds will accelerate the development of former No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams. Moore ranked 91st in the NFL in average distance of target with Williams feeling constant pressure behind a bad offensive line, but Chicago added three new starters up front and Johnson is likely to be far more aggressive. That's a big reason why the model ranks Moore as a top-20 receiver in its 2025 Fantasy football rankings.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=06162025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetssleepers" target="_blank">See which other Fantasy football sleepers 2025 to pick here</a>.</p>
        

<h2>How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankings</h2><p>SportsLine is also extremely high on a veteran wide receiver to surprise with his production. The model says this wideout is a shocking top-10 option ahead of younger stars like A.J. Brown and Drake London.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=06162025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetssleepers" target="_blank">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025 Fantasy Football sleepers should you target?
