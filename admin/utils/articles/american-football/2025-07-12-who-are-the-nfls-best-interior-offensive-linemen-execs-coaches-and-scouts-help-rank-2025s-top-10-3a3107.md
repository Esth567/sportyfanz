<strong>Age:</strong> 26 | <strong>Last year's ranking:</strong> 7</p><p>Last year, Humphrey made the case as the best overall center since Jason Kelce. Now, he's the top interior linemen thanks to consistency in the voting. He's the only one to appear on every ballot and was a top-three recipient on the majority of them.</p><p>Humphrey's 96.2 pass block win rate last season ranks sixth among all interior offensive linemen. He's the lead communicator for a championship-level offense. And his intangibles are well-known around the league.</p><p>"He's great in pass protection, great feet and instincts," an NFL coordinator said. "Not a mauler in the running game but can get it done enough. Deals with chaos well and can navigate a lot of moving parts for that offense."</p><p>While Humphrey's 73.2 run block win rate is solid if unspectacular, he did curb the snapping issue that plagued him in 2023. His play in the Super Bowl suffered in part because <a data-player-guid="cc4a49c2-036e-c616-afe2-52ca31d2406d" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577773/joe-thuney">Joe Thuney</a> sliding to left tackle forced him to help more in protection.</p><p>"If you can isolate him one-on-one, you can kick his ass a little bit," the coordinator said. But that's not true most of the time. Humphrey did not allow a quick pressure (under 2.5 seconds) across 653 pass-blocking snaps during the regular season.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4568652.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><h2>2. <a data-player-guid="9f728909-aaff-c6bc-8cc0-507eb9bdc109" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4568652/tyler-smith">Tyler Smith</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="b0fc8fb7-9dbe-e574-9008-6f0ee7c6b234" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a></h2><p><strong>Highest ranking:</strong> 1 | <strong>Lowest ranking:</strong> Unranked<br>

He wasn't on every top 10 ballot, but most of the votes he did get were for first or second place.</p><p>"Most physically gifted guard in the league who could legitimately be a top starter at LT if they wanted to play him there," an NFL general manager said. "Strong, athletic, nasty, and cut his holding penalties in half last year."</p><p>One knock is overaggressive (which gets him out of control at times), but his penalties dropped from 10 to two year-over-year, according to Pro Football Reference. Either way, teams can live with Smith's aggressiveness because "if he gets his hands on you, it's over," an NFL coordinator said. Most personnel-based voters rely heavily on traits and what a player can be. Smith fits that bill.</p><p>Smith held up well in pass protection, with three sacks allowed on 614 snaps on passing downs.</p><p>"Best guard in football," an NFL defensive line coach said. "Perennial Pro Bowl guy. Quick explosive, violent, strong hands, above-average pass pro, can reach second level."</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3129308.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><h2>3. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3129308/quenton-nelson">Quenton Nelson</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a></h2><p><strong>Highest ranking:</strong> 1 | <strong>Lowest ranking</strong>: Unranked<br>
<strong>Age:</strong> 29 | <strong>Last year's ranking:</strong> 2</p><p>Nelson competed with Martin for the top spot over multiple years, and now that Martin is retired, Nelson takes his place as the highest-ranked guard or center with at least seven NFL seasons in the NFL.</p><p>Nelson is building what could become a Hall of Fame case, making the Pro Bowl every year since 2018. The Colts thought Nelson bounced back with a resurgent 2023 after a down 2022 (for his standards), and he remained solid in 2024 with a 94.4 pass block win rate and 77.1 run block win rate, the latter tying for first among the top 10 interior linemen.</p><p>The Colts are consistently a quality running team despite the lack of quarterback stability, and Nelson is a big part of that.</p><p>"Honestly, nobody else has really taken the top spot from him," an NFC executive said. "I don't think there's a dominant interior OL right now. He's the closest thing."</p><p>And his durability should be commended. Nelson has played at least 16 games in every season but 2021, when he played 13 games.</p><p>"He's more vulnerable with edge pressure than he used to at this stage of his career," a veteran NFL defensive coach said. "But he's still really strong and stout at the point of attack."</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4242459.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><h2>4. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242459/trey-smith"> Trey Smith</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a></h2><p><strong>Highest ranking:</strong> 1 | <strong>Lowest ranking:</strong> Unranked<br>
<strong>Age:</strong> 26 | <strong>Last year's ranking:</strong> 9</p><p>That Kansas City franchise tagged Smith at $23.4 million says a lot about the quality of the player. The Chiefs are often salary cap-strapped and aren't afraid to let marquee free agents walk... but Smith is too unique to escape the Chiefs' facility.</p><p>"Power, brute strength, physicality -- he's a people-mover and a people-stopper," an AFC executive said.</p><p>Smith was a first-round talent in 2021 but fell to the seventh round as some teams were not comfortable with his medical profile, due to a heart condition detected while at Tennessee. He has overcome that to become a premier player.</p><p>Smith's 75.1 run block win rate ranks third among this group, and he received several first-place votes because of it. As one NFL coordinator said, "He's got elite hands, and he is great at finishing his blocks."</p><p>To be sure, Smith had a rough Super Bowl loss against Philadelphia. But the entire Chiefs line struggled that night, and that game will hardly define him.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4035624.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><h2>5. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035624/landon-dickerson">Landon Dickerson</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a></h2><p><strong>Highest ranking:</strong> 3 | <strong>Lowest ranking:</strong> Unranked<br>
<strong>Age:</strong> 26 | <strong>Last year's ranking:</strong> 7</p><p>Dickerson wasted little time establishing himself along Philadelphia's vaunted line, earning a Pro Bowl nod in each of the past three seasons.</p><p>"Explosive power -- holy smokes," a veteran NFL offensive line coach said. "Strength, durability. He's built to last. The organized mass he can help create is top-notch."</p><p>Evaluators saw premier status for him entering 2024, which largely proved true since Dickerson helped lead Philadelphia to a championship.</p><p>But one oddity accompanied his profile -- ESPN stats attributed 11 sacks to Dickerson, the most of any player in our top 10. An Eagles source was surprised to hear that number, adding Dickerson was at no point a liability in the pass game. Further research shows Dickerson struggled early with six sacks allowed in the first seven weeks but picked it up late, averaging an impressive 97 pass block win rate from Week 8 through the Super Bowl.</p><p>Dickerson was dealing with a knee issue during the championship run. He played through it.</p><p>"He was banged up some, and it looked like he played a bit heavier [in 2024]," an NFL coordinator said. "He played well, but I actually think he'll be even better next year."</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/2577773.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><h2>6. <a data-player-guid="cc4a49c2-036e-c616-afe2-52ca31d2406d" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577773/joe-thuney">Joe Thuney</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="19d73366-b5a5-cca2-a176-a2c024ce0bb3" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</a></h2><p><strong>Highest ranking:</strong> 1 | <strong>Lowest ranking:</strong> Unranked<br>
<strong>Age:</strong> 32 | <strong>Last year's ranking:</strong> 4</p><p>One of most impressive football feats of the 2024 NFL season was Thuney, at 6-foot-5 and 304 pounds, successfully transitioning from guard to left tackle late in the season. The Chiefs were in a bind, and the offensive line needed help, and Thuney stabilized it. Chiefs coach Andy Reid lauded the move, saying Thuney never complained -- and he held his own incredibly well.</p><p>Thuney is always among the best statistically -- his 96.4 pass block win rate is tied for first among guards with Denver's <a data-player-guid="921980f2-c0f1-69d7-1bce-830f772a8754" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4037650/ben-powers">Ben Powers</a> -- but his versatility was on full display last year.</p><p>"Complete package: Speed, athletic ability, hand placement, toughness, instincts," an AFC executive said. "I think power is a slight deficiency.

"He has learned that he doesn't have to destroy people every play. He's athletic and strong enough that if he plays controlled, the losses will be few and far between."</p><p>The numbers bear that out: His 96.6 pass block win rate led all offensive linemen with at least 800 snaps played.</p><p>Meinerz is emblematic of the Broncos' culture.
