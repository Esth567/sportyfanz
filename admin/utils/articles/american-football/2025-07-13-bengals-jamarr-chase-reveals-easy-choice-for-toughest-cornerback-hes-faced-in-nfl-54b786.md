        <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966320/jamarr-chase/">Ja'Marr Chase</a> was the best wide receiver in the <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a> last season. The <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/">Cincinnati Bengals</a> star became the fifth player since 1970 to take the receiving triple crown, leading all players with 127 receptions for 1,708 yards and 17 touchdowns. No other <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a> player has ever recorded 1,700 yards receiving and caught 17 touchdowns in a season.&nbsp;</p><p>Chase was virtually uncoverable in 2024, so it was interesting when he was asked about the toughest cornerback he's faced during an appearance on "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4SrShXcEYk&amp;t=705s" target="_blank">The Sitdown w/ Malik Wright</a>." Chase believes that one of the best cornerbacks in the league resides in his division, as he named <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179829/denzel-ward/">Denzel Ward</a> of the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/">Cleveland Browns</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's easy. I mean, Denzel," Chase said, <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/bengals-wr-ja-marr-chase-quickly-tabs-browns-rival-denzel-ward-as-easy-choice-for-toughest-cb-he-s-faced" target="_blank">via NFL.com</a>. "It's twice a year. It's one on one majority of the time. He got great feet. He knows leverage, he knows splits. He's one of the best I like playing."</p>

<p>The former No. 4 overall pick out of Ohio State has made the Pro Bowl in each of the last two seasons, and recorded 49 combined tackles, two interceptions and a league-leading 19 passes defensed in 2024. In fact, Ward has recorded at least 10 passes defensed in all seven of his NFL campaigns despite having never played a full season.</p><p>Ward has certainly struggled to stay healthy over his career, but he did appear in a career-high 16 games this past season. In his two matchups vs. Cleveland last year, Chase failed to catch more than six passes or cross 100 yards receiving.</p>
        

<p>The AFC North features some big names at cornerback, including <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071515/jalen-ramsey/">Jalen Ramsey</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125620/joey-porter-jr/">Joey Porter Jr.</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1852913/darius-slay/">Darius Slay</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181152/jaire-alexander/">Jaire Alexander</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139775/marlon-humphrey/">Marlon Humphrey</a>. But Chase believes Ward is the best of the best.&nbsp;</p>
