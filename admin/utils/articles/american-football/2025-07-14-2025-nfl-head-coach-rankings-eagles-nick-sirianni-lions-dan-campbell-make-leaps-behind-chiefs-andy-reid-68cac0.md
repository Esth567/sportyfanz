        <p>Football is a team sport, which was last evidenced pretty clearly in Super Bowl LIX: The Philadelphia Eagles dominated the Kansas City Chiefs thanks to an all-star setup on both sides of the ball, and despite an apparent disadvantage on the sidelines, where Nick Sirianni faced off with arguably the best coach in the game -- and one of the best of all time -- in Andy Reid.</p><p>Is it a coincidence, however, that Sirianni was in his second title game in three years, and Reid was in his fifth in six seasons? Is it possible that both of their respective teams had become Super Bowl regulars thanks in large part <em>to </em>their presence on the headset? You see, if football is a team sport, then all positions matter, and there's a case to be made that coaches are second only to quarterbacks when it comes to determining the ultimate trajectory of a contender; they, after all, are the ones calling the shots.</p><p>So which of the NFL's head coaches are difference-makers -- for both better and worse? Which ones are cemented as elite shepherds of both rebuilds and title bids? And which ones are under lots of pressure to make the most of their clubs in 2025? Here's our complete ranking of all 32, divided into three tiers, knowing full well these men have a chance to write -- or rewrite -- their own true stories when the games begin this year:</p><h2>Tier 3: Unproven or underwhelming</h2><p><em>As long as these coaches are employed, they have a chance to redeem themselves. As we stand, however, they've either yet to prove their staying power or struggled to build a promising program.</em></p>
        

<h3>32. Brian Callahan (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a>)</h3><figure><p><img alt="NFL: DEC 22 Titans at Colts" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/05/22/2dc52829-7143-42f3-b239-51efb36fcd9c/resize/670x377/068c86c38a2930b5dc4591ad71c4ad4c/gettyimages-2190580429.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>

Brian Schottenheimer (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a>)</h3><figure><p><img alt="getty-brian-schottenheimer-jerry-jones-cowboys.jpg" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/01/29/9b2556b3-3e7a-4a2e-be8b-a16818085c64/resize/670x377/ce04d7ae5f70fbdad41891409f80b0ba/getty-brian-schottenheimer-jerry-jones-cowboys.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>

But this is Jerry Jones' show, so it's actually par for the course. Yes, Schottenheimer's name may be bigger than his resume, but this man first held a coordinator job way back in 2006; it's not like he's totally lacking in <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a> chops. Are we sure there isn't a remote possibility he makes like, say, Doug Pederson -- another former NFC East hire who was overlooked by all except his own team's powerful front office -- and proves to be just the approachable leader Dallas needs?</p><h3>30. Brian Daboll (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/">Giants</a>)</h3><figure><p><img alt="getty-brian-daboll-giants.jpg" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/10/08/8bb9caeb-4525-4af9-9a89-f61a143522ef/resize/670x377/3ac8957ef227b1b7ee91eb752de92940/getty-brian-daboll-giants.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>

That feels like ages ago, with his record only plummeting since then. Unveiling rookie dual threat <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/">Jaxson Dart</a> may well buy him more time, unless the aging <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/">Russell Wilson</a> proves to be the serviceable downfield arm he's been hunting for years.</p>

Whether that translates to managing an entire organization is anyone's guess.</p><h3>28. Aaron Glenn (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/">Jets</a>)</h3><figure><p><img alt="getty-aaron-glenn-lions.jpg" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/14/3d55b3fe-b5fa-4aa9-a529-78302e281b77/resize/670x377/767121c229b621067decc7f1cd8f86bf/getty-aaron-glenn-jets.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>

His greatest challenge will be stabilizing, not further dramatizing, such a troubled franchise.</p><h3>27. Raheem Morris (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a>)</h3><figure><p><img alt="raheem-morris-us.jpg" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/11/bf81439b-feca-484b-8ac5-c728cf5d3738/resize/670x377/a306de0e918f73727c9b13555166ab1f/raheem-morris-us.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>

If <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963496/michael-penix-jr/">Michael Penix Jr</a>. delivers under center, the tides could turn.</p>

The key will be tapping into <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695775/caleb-williams/">Caleb Williams</a>' gifts while also keeping the gunslinger in check, which is a balance previous regimes couldn't manage with their own quarterback projects.</p>

At minimum, Macdonald should have them scrappy.</p>

No other coach, after all, has guided four NFC title-game appearances in five years, while also overseeing four losing seasons. It's pretty simple here: If his toys are sturdy, he can draw up a shootout with the best of them. Robert Saleh's return as a right-hand man on defense should also help, though Shanahan's also got a conservative bent in the biggest moments.</p><h3>6.

Everywhere Harbaugh's gone -- Stanford, the 49ers, Michigan -- he's built a disciplined big-game contender. He's set to double-down on the bruising approach this year.</p><h3>5. Dan Campbell (Lions)</h3><figure><p><img alt="dan-campbell.jpg" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/02/27/88b51f3e-1e33-47ba-963a-22796419a33e/resize/670x377/05b1d35673e61d73f2890e136f5c6cdf/dan-campbell.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>

He went from laughable meme to enviable leader as Brad Holmes began outfitting him with all-star weaponry, and even heartbreaks haven't deterred his unit from playing with the authority of an NFC heavyweight. Losing both of his coordinators in 2025 will be a new test, but let's not forget he's been the man steering Motown since his arrival.</p><h3>4. Nick Sirianni (Eagles)</h3><figure><p><img alt="sirianni.jpg" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/09/15/187072b0-81fd-436b-851a-2447c3fea9c9/resize/670x377/d32632b078bb881514f1d1d44ac3ab28/sirianni.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>

Then he put his head down and <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-extend-nick-sirianni-inside-the-coachs-improbable-journey-from-ridiculed-leader-to-championship-glue/" target="_blank">became the behind-the-scenes glue</a></span> for a remarkable rebound with a historically dominant finish. Maybe he's boosted by Howie Roseman collecting premium talent across the board. But you don't shepherd two Super Bowl appearances in three years by accident. He embodies the Philadelphia spirit with his passion.</p><h3>3. John Harbaugh (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/">Ravens</a>)</h3><figure><p><img alt="harbaugh-2.jpg" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2020/01/17/27d651c9-1f26-4ff4-9c4d-775f75079612/resize/670x377/f0152db342e8bead90811ed9b19b77ec/harbaugh-2.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>
                                                                    Imagn Images
                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>2024 Rank:&nbsp;</strong>4</li><li><strong>Season:&nbsp;</strong>18th with Ravens, 18th as coach</li><li><strong>Career record:&nbsp;</strong>172-104&nbsp;|&nbsp;<strong>Playoffs:&nbsp;</strong>13-11 (1-0 in Super Bowls)</li></ul><p>Why is Harbaugh so much higher than Tomlin, his AFC North counterpart, given his similar lack of recent Lombardi action? His Ravens have proven more adaptable, leaning into <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jacksons/">Lamar Jackson's</a> legs while also developing the MVP's aerial efficiency, and they've also parlayed perennial playoff bids into actual postseason victories over the last half-decade. It's fair to question whether he's always got Baltimore locked in until the finish line, considering the club's penchant for blown leads, but you can always count on his group making the dance. It feels like a matter of when, not if, Jackson will help get him over the hump again.</p><h3>2. Sean McVay (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/">Rams</a>)</h3><figure><p><img alt="Los Angeles Rams v New York Giants" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2021/11/01/0ce5e392-d714-4d73-ab35-4fd51ef5fdad/resize/670x377/9e8bdb74e479cf669131e9802cc9709f/new-team.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>
                                                                    Getty Images
                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>2024 Rank:&nbsp;</strong>2</li><li><strong>Season:&nbsp;</strong>9th with Rams, 9th as coach</li><li><strong>Career record:&nbsp;</strong>80-52&nbsp;|&nbsp;<strong>Playoffs:&nbsp;</strong>8-5 (1-1 in Super Bowls)</li></ul><p>If you were starting a brand-new franchise, you'd be hard-pressed to hire anyone else. McVay is battle-tested thanks to six different playoff runs in eight years, two of which ended in the Super Bowl. He's also energetic enough to cultivate long-term growth; look no further than how quickly the Rams' remade young defense found its footing. Give McVay, who remains a near-unmatched motivator, a competent and/or reasonably healthy quarterback, and you're locked in for a solid January fight.</p><h3>1. Andy Reid (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a>)</h3><figure><p><img alt="reid.png" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2022/01/18/5a35750f-1558-42b6-a1cd-a8fc4c3dcfff/resize/670x377/5dc6cf9c0dbe24f61e8a7c7656752473/reid.png" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>

                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>2024 Rank: </strong>1</li><li><strong>Season:&nbsp;</strong>13th with Chiefs, 26th as coach</li><li><strong>Career record:&nbsp;</strong>258-144-1 |&nbsp;<strong>Playoffs:&nbsp;</strong>26-16 (3-2 in Super Bowls)</li></ul><p>Did his lauded offensive strategies overcome the Chiefs' utter lack of trench stability in their last Super Bowl effort? No way. But "last" is the key word there; Kansas City has still advanced to five of the last six championship contests under his watch. That's ridiculous, no matter how you slice it. Once the chief of football's most colorful big-play machine, Reid's units have since adapted to win on the margins, with <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/">Patrick Mahomes</a> in particular excelling as more of a situational artist alongside makeshift lineups. Is he perfect? No. Is he aging? Yes. But every roster he fields respects his warm, familial and proven leadership. And every winter, with Mahomes by his side, he's registered as Mr. Inevitable, pushing the Chiefs the extra yard whenever they most need it.</p>
