He analyzes football <a href="https://www.espn.com/search/_/q/bill%20barnwell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on and off the field</a> like no one else on the planet, writing about in-season X's and O's, offseason transactions and so much more.<p>

He is the host of the <a href="http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=15230808" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Barnwell Show podcast</a>, with episodes released weekly. Barnwell joined ESPN in 2011 as a staff writer at Grantland.</p></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/schedule/_/week/1/year/2000/seasontype/2">Sept. 3, 2000</a>, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/">NFL</a> inaugurated its first season to begin with a "2." It was, to put things charitably, a different time. There was no opening night with the defending champs on Thursday or an international game on Friday (or any other game outside of the United States all season). No games were watched in high definition. The yellow, on-screen first-down line was roughly two years old. <a data-player-guid="37d87523-280a-9d4a-0adb-22cfc6d3619c" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/2650/pat-mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a> was a pitcher on the Mets; <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes">his son</a> was about to turn 5. <a data-player-guid="be3c0e30-5a1e-8174-091d-a41bf4e2d51e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a> was a healthy scratch after making the Patriots' roster in training camp; the guy who kept him, Bill Belichick, was taking over his first game as New England's coach.</p><p>The NFL we're about to watch in 2025 is very different, both in terms of aesthetic and presentation, than the one you followed 25 years ago. Offenses and defenses have evolved pre- and post-snap, although some innovations are clever repackagings of past concepts. Rules have changed. NFL teams that might not have needed or wanted computers 25 years ago are sorting through <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/24445965/player-tracking-data-next-step-nfl-analytics-revolution">player tracking data</a>. It's almost impossible to pluck teams from two decades ago and compare them to the teams playing now.</p><p>Good thing it's only <em>almost</em> impossible, because guess what we're doing today? That's right: With 25 seasons in the books since the world celebrated the birth of the third millennium, I'm picking the 25 best teams of the past 25 years of professional football. If you could somehow take those 25 top teams from the past quarter century and get them to play one another, who would end up on top?</p><p><em><strong>Subscribe: <a href="https://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=15230808">'The Bill Barnwell Show'</a></strong></em></p><p>That's the question I'm trying to answer below, which requires some explanation. There are lots of ways to try to answer this question. Should it be a measure of which team was most successful? Which teams played the best on a snap-by-snap basis? Should I consider each team at its peak or over the entire season? What about accounting for shorter schedules and different playoff rules?</p><p>I tried to strike a balance. My goal is to find the best team if all of these teams could play each other in what amounts to a time-traveling <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.champions">Champions League</a> of the past quarter century. I considered what every team did over the course of the entire season, all the way from Week 1 through the playoffs, as the best measure of its true underlying level of play. I tried to account for injuries to emulate what we actually saw play out during each team's real season. The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/phi/season/2017">2017 Eagles</a>, for example, are going to have <a data-player-guid="0a977ad1-142c-a3dd-ddd0-3c40f1b68fdd" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14877/nick-foles">Nick Foles</a> start about 31% of the time, since he took over for an injured <a data-player-guid="ed28fa2c-63a1-8258-b6b0-618e79d3e363" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573079/carson-wentz">Carson Wentz</a> and played six of their 19 total games during their run to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400999173/eagles-patriots">Super Bowl LII</a>.</p><p>At the same time, I wanted to reward teams that won championships. I weighted postseason performance as more significant than what happened during the regular season. I looked for teams that dominated their opposition, especially when those opponents were also among the league's best. I wanted to favor teams that were complete and controlled both sides of the ball, but I didn't want to leave out true outliers that were generationally impactful on offense or defense, especially if they rode those successes into the Super Bowl.</p><p>To compare their performance, with limited data for the earlier years of the century, I kept things simple. I measured each team's scoring offense and defense per game, including its postseason figures, and then normalized them against the league average. I'm going to include each team's percentile rank on offense and defense over the past 25 years by this measure, a number that is better when higher, with 100 as the peak. Where available, I tried to use advanced metrics to get more insight into each team's level of play.</p><p>I also focused on sustainable and strong underlying levels of play as opposed to teams that were spectacular in close games or managed to squeeze out victories each week. While all of the teams here won plenty of games, this isn't a list of win totals. As a good example, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/kc/season/2024">2024 Chiefs</a> went 15-2 while winning close games with blocked field goals, fumbled snaps and bad game management by the opposing coach, but they weren't that caliber of team from their underlying level of play. You saw what happened to them against stiff competition in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671889/chiefs-eagles">Super Bowl LIX</a>. They didn't make this list.</p><p>Finally, I measured strength of schedule using the Pythagorean formula. For each opponent a team faced in a given season, I calculated its points scored and points allowed in games not involving that team, then built an expected winning percentage off that formula. (In other words, to measure how tough of an opponent the Ravens were for the Steelers in a given year, I calculated how the Ravens performed in every game they played that didn't involve the Steelers.) Weighting for how often each team played each opponent, this average schedule difficulty helped inform the path each team took during its season.</p><p>With all of that in mind, for all the math and analysis, I asked myself one question when I was comparing a pair of teams on the list: Given everything we saw from each of these two teams over the course of their entire seasons, which would win if they met on a neutral field? Sometimes, that led to contradictory answers: There are teams on this list that lost to other teams that didn't make it or even come close. That might seem counterintuitive given that you literally saw that team win, but what happens on one day won't necessarily happen again. The Bills have beaten the Chiefs four straight times in the regular season; you know how things have gone when they've met in the playoffs.</p><p>I'll start with the honorable mention, then count down the best teams of the past 25 years:</p><p><strong>Jump to a legendary team:</strong><br>

By restricting myself to 25 teams in 25 seasons, even my limited math is good enough to know I'm grabbing an average of one team per year. Though there are a couple of seasons in which I ended up taking two teams, think about <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoff-bracket">2024</a> and what limiting ourselves to one team means. With the Eagles being my pick, that means the Chiefs don't make it. It also means no 15-2 Lions. No 14-3 Vikings. No 13-4 Bills with <a data-player-guid="853f8768-54bd-6a4f-cb10-63d6df1e7742" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen">Josh Allen</a>'s MVP campaign. No 12-5 Commanders and <a data-player-guid="f03f3238-b035-6f0e-5844-1529ca021c3a" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426348/jayden-daniels">Jayden Daniels</a>' special rookie campaign. There are similar great teams from each of the past 25 years that simply get squeezed out.</p><p>With that in mind, I'm limiting the honorable mention discussion to the 12 teams that won the Super Bowl and didn't end up in the top 25. Obviously, winning pro football's biggest prize is a valuable item to put on a résumé -- I weighted things disproportionately in favor of teams that took home the Lombardi Trophy -- but I'm considering what those teams did over the entire <em>season</em>, not just how their campaign ended. Let's run through those teams and why I believe they came up short in this ranking:</p><p>Everyone remembers three moments for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ne/season/2001"><b>2001 Patriots</b></a>: <a data-player-guid="9bfcc743-5a15-c688-ce14-492df1f45168" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/393/drew-bledsoe">Drew Bledsoe</a> suffering <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/clayton_john/1256146.html" target="_new">internal bleeding on a September hit</a> and opening up the door for <a data-player-guid="be3c0e30-5a1e-8174-091d-a41bf4e2d51e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a>, the Tuck Rule game and <a data-player-guid="80e14c37-27c3-31a6-e768-c686b2e6c510" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1097/adam-vinatieri">Adam Vinatieri</a>'s field goals in the snow to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220119017/raiders-patriots">beat the Raiders</a>, and an incredible performance in upsetting the Greatest Show on Turf as 14-point underdogs in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220203017/rams-patriots">Super Bowl XXXVI</a>.</p><p>What's lost to history is a good team that doesn't push its way into the top 25. Including their playoff run, these Patriots played the second-easiest schedule of any Super Bowl winner over the past 25 years, as they had just two wins over teams with winning records during the regular season. Their playoff wins were all narrow, although whatever good fortune they might have come across in the victory over the Raiders was offset by losing Brady to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs01/news/2002/0130/1320293.html">an ankle injury</a> in the second quarter of the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220127023/patriots-steelers">AFC Championship Game</a>, with Bledsoe coming back in to help top <a data-player-guid="b72e61a8-dfd7-9579-d550-43511a45a8a3" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/736/kordell-stewart">Kordell Stewart</a> and the Steelers. Their best game of the season, quite comfortably, came in the Super Bowl. Many of the players on this team would eventually help turn New England into a dynasty, but there were much better versions of the Patriots to come.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/pit/season/2005"><b>2005 Steelers</b></a> were 7-5 late in the season before going on an eight-game winning streak to claim <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/260205023/seahawks-steelers">Super Bowl XL</a>. Some of those issues were due to <a data-player-guid="b941dabb-40e2-1086-e171-df0628618bf3" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5536/ben-roethlisberger">Ben Roethlisberger</a> missing four games with knee injuries, but Pittsburgh didn't even win its division. That honor went to the Bengals, who were then knocked out of the playoffs in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/260108004/steelers-bengals">wild-card round</a> by the Steelers when <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/565/kimo-von-von-oelhoffen">Kimo Von Oelhoeffen</a> famously tore <a data-player-guid="596cb538-a263-af23-b239-aa28ff7cc346" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4459/carson-palmer">Carson Palmer</a>'s left ACL on the latter's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs05/news/story?id=2285361">second postseason snap</a>.</p><p>The Steelers then survived a <a data-player-guid="6cc47176-ff81-d6fc-41a5-f103ef097cfe" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/389/jerome-bettis">Jerome Bettis</a> fumble on the goal line <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/260115011/steelers-colts">against the Colts</a> that nearly produced a 98-yard touchdown that would have completed an 18-point fourth-quarter comeback, only for Roethlisberger to make the best tackle of his career. <a data-player-guid="fe6f0eac-44a6-d957-4d41-600ba95411e5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1669/mike-vanderjagt">Mike Vanderjagt</a> then missed a 46-yard field goal that would have sent the game to overtime. In the Super Bowl, Roethlisberger posted a 22.6 passer rating and threw two picks, but the Steelers beat the Seahawks in a game marred by <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5444048" target="_new">dismal officiating</a>. They were survivors, but this wasn't even a great team by their lofty standards.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ind/season/2006"><b>2006 Colts</b></a> were a great team when they had star safety <a data-player-guid="b0af01b3-d32c-c56b-008c-656c4b45080f" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5569/bob-sanders">Bob Sanders</a>, going 7-1 with him on the field. Sanders played just four regular-season games before returning for the playoffs, at which point the Colts ran the table, most famously with a comeback from 21-3 down <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/270121011/patriots-colts">against the archrival Patriots</a> to finally get <a data-player-guid="78d91edb-3223-7991-5793-36664e222d79" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1428/peyton-manning">Peyton Manning</a> his playoff win over <a data-player-guid="be3c0e30-5a1e-8174-091d-a41bf4e2d51e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a>. The Sanders-led defense forced 13 turnovers during a four-game playoff run, including five by <a data-player-guid="c3f40b73-45ae-221e-48fc-1f6c30fb6df8" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4480/rex-grossman">Rex Grossman</a> and the Bears in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/270204003/colts-bears">Super Bowl XLI</a>.</p><p>Without Sanders for much of the season, the Colts finished 23rd in scoring defense. They were the league's worst third-down defense and the second-worst red zone defense during the regular season. Just taking the best version of this team and assuming Sanders could play 17 games, they would be in the top 25. As it stands, other versions of the Manning-era Colts make the list, even without a ring.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/nyg/season/2007"><b>2007 Giants</b></a> produced what might have been the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280203017/giants-patriots">most memorable victory</a> of the Super Bowl era, controlling the vaunted Patriots offense and coming up with <a data-player-guid="52069eb3-9563-e8d4-0df4-d3c3e1bed572" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4669/david-tyree">David Tyree</a>'s famous <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/nfceast/post/_/id/62823/giants-top-play-1-tyrees-helmet-catch">helmet catch</a> to set up a championship-winning touchdown. Making a run through the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280106027/giants-buccaneers">Buccaneers</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280113006/giants-cowboys">Cowboys</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280120009/giants-packers">Packers</a> on the NFC side of the bracket, the Giants waylaid history.</p><p>Of course, they also lost to those same Patriots <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/271229019/patriots-giants">during the regular season</a>, where they were also swept by the Cowboys and lost to the Packers. They had a minus-nine turnover differential during the regular season, and while they played the Pats close in the last week, that followed an eight-game stretch in which <a data-player-guid="629fd2c1-6c50-e8e3-b307-99a84fab0d67" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5526/eli-manning">Eli Manning</a> completed 51.1% of his passes and turned the ball over twice as often (14 times) as he produced touchdowns (seven, with six through the air.) This team had a great defensive line, and it hit a new stride when it leaned into its young talent during the postseason, but one snap before the helmet catch, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1QkoOUEgyc&amp;t=1h57m">would-be interception</a> bounced off <a data-player-guid="4a6d749a-1b0c-6fee-6456-6e9ce381037d" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4578/asante-samuel">Asante Samuel</a>'s hands. If he had caught that pass, nobody would even pretend this is a debate. The Giants deserve all the credit in the world for what they accomplished, but I wouldn't like their chances against these teams over another 17-game season.</p><p>The good news is that no fans will be mad at me for also leaving the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/nyg/season/2011"><b>2011 Giants</b></a> out of the top 25. Right? The 2011 version was actually outscored during the regular season, albeit while playing a tough schedule. The Giants were 7-7 in December and Manning was being <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2011/12/21/10-questions-for-the-big-ny-giants-ny-jets-clash-answered-by-new-york-daily-news-beat-writers/">unfavorably compared</a> to fellow New York quarterback <a data-player-guid="254e85b1-d83f-3a90-c134-ff12b7fe28c5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12482/mark-sanchez">Mark Sanchez</a> before the team rolled off wins over the Jets and the Cowboys to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320101019/cowboys-giants">win the NFC East</a> on the final day of the season.</p><p>The league's 25th-ranked scoring defense improved massively during the playoffs, with the Giants <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320108019/falcons-giants">holding the Falcons</a> to a lone safety and then slowing down the 15-1 Packers in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320115009/giants-packers">divisional round</a>. New York put up a great <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320122025/giants-49ers">conference title game</a> performance against the 49ers, who did nothing on offense and went 1-for-13 on third down one week after dropping 36 points on the Saints. The Giants then forced an early safety from Tom Brady and shut out the Patriots for the final 26 minutes of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320205017/giants-patriots">Super Bowl XLVI</a>, eventually winning 21-17.</p><p>Was there a bit of fortune during their playoff run? Of course. <a data-player-guid="b9329296-e707-0fff-e1df-4f7a5b3731e3" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12586/hakeem-nicks">Hakeem Nicks</a> caught a Hail Mary to extend a lead against Green Bay on a day in which the Giants fell on all three Packers fumbles.

Another <a href="https://www.espn.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/7545653/2012-super-bowl-wes-welker-says-let-new-england-patriots-dropped-pass">fourth-quarter drop</a> helped the Giants, this time coming on offense from <a data-player-guid="18b49ffc-8e74-7ff0-b93a-e362db20578e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5941/wes-welker">Wes Welker</a> in the Super Bowl. As with 2007, this was another team that was great in the postseason and closer to league average during the regular season. It's tough to sneak in when there are so many teams that were good in both spots.</p><p>Like the Super Bowl-winning Colts, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/bal/season/2012"><b>2012 Ravens</b></a> looked a lot better on defense during the postseason. <a data-player-guid="4841b102-7fff-30e5-7e09-a5310143414f" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4468/terrell-suggs">Terrell Suggs</a> missed the first half of the year, and <a data-player-guid="b2af036c-e8b9-6fe8-ca18-81cf019fd350" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/964/ray-lewis">Ray Lewis</a> was limited to six regular-season games by injuries. By the end of the year, the Ravens didn't seem like a Super Bowl contender; they lost four of their final five games, limping into the postseason at 10-6.</p><p>Though Lewis wasn't anywhere near his peak, his return for the postseason helped spark the defense, which forced 10 turnovers in four games. The Ravens needed a miracle to make it past the Broncos in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/330112007/ravens-broncos">divisional round</a> and got one when Denver safety <a data-player-guid="3172946e-d7e2-b91a-aabe-ca1b50faf5c4" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14050/rahim-moore">Rahim Moore</a> misjudged a <a data-player-guid="cfd567df-191e-29cf-0dc6-0bcf84085135" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco">Joe Flacco</a> bomb with a seven-point lead and 43 seconds left, allowing <a data-player-guid="54a66e3c-9945-3370-be5f-95cd2695d6e6" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5083297/jacoby-jones">Jacoby Jones</a> to run past him for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmRYZOuXHrA">70-yard score</a> to tie the game. The Ravens won in overtime, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/330120017/ravens-patriots">beat the Patriots</a> in Foxborough and then won the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8912611/super-bowl-xlvii-ravens-49ers-soon-forgotten">Harbaugh Bowl</a> against the 49ers in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/330203025/ravens-49ers">Super Bowl XLVII</a>.</p><p>Flacco had the hottest stretch of his career at exactly the right time, posting a 117.2 passer rating and throwing nine touchdowns without a pick during the postseason. There's a significant span of time before and after suggesting that stretch is an outlier for the veteran passer. This wasn't the best Baltimore team of the Flacco/John Harbaugh era, but it was the one that had the best timing.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ne/season/2014"><b>2014 Patriots</b></a> might suffer from being compared with so many other Pats teams. (There are a few, as you can probably surmise, in the top 25.) This was the season they famously <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/boston/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4785766/one-year-later-revisiting-patriots-blowout-loss-at-chiefs-as-turning-point">looked cooked</a> on "Monday Night Football" in a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400554325/patriots-chiefs">41-14 loss</a> to the Chiefs, only for a return to form from <a data-player-guid="71e8284e-f365-0015-9a80-9c4e72a7c508" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13229/rob-gronkowski">Rob Gronkowski</a> and a revamped offensive line to quickly hush any concerns about a 37-year-old Brady losing his touch. Leaving aside a meaningless <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400554438/bills-patriots">Week 18 game</a>, the Pats went 13-1 after the loss in Kansas City.</p><p>The playoff run wasn't as dominant as others. They prevailed in a chaotic <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400749515/ravens-patriots">35-31 game</a> against the Ravens, owing in part to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/12150444/2014-15-nfl-playoffs-league-says-new-england-patriots-substitutions-vs-baltimore-ravens-legal" target="_new">a substitution tactic</a> that was banned after the season. They blew out an overmatched Colts team in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400749520/colts-patriots">AFC Championship Game</a>. In <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400749027/patriots-seahawks">Super Bowl XLIX</a>, they allowed the Seahawks to come within a yard of taking the lead with 26 seconds to go.

The Broncos ranked 19th in scoring offense and 30th in turnovers (31). The offense wasn't good during the playoff run, but with Manning restored to the lineup, they turned the ball over only three times in three games, which was enough to earn a ring.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ne/season/2018"><b>2018 Patriots</b></a> were more good than great during the regular season, as an 11-5 team benefited from an easy schedule and finished 19th in defense-adjusted value over average. If you thought they were good at the time, you had to argue with Brady, who <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25753861/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-says-everybody-thinks-suck" target="_new">insisted, "Everybody thinks we suck and can't win any games"</a> in his postgame chat after the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401038959/chargers-patriots">divisional round victory</a> over the Chargers. (No footage could be found suggesting this was true.)</p><p>This wasn't a great defense, and the Patriots relied heavily on the offense to pull out victories over the Chargers and Chiefs in the playoffs, beating the latter after blowing a three-point lead with 39 seconds left only to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401038850/patriots-chiefs">prevail in overtime</a> under the league's old rules by winning the coin toss and scoring a touchdown on the opening drive. In <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401038115/patriots-rams">Super Bowl LIII</a>, though, they were great for one day, as Bill Belichick leaned into the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25921740/super-bowl-liii-was-greatest-defensive-performance-history-here-how-patriots-did-rams">6-1 front Vic Fangio had used</a> to stymie the Rams in the regular season, taking away their run game and forcing <a data-player-guid="987f4f39-ed6f-5915-57eb-ec7dc356171c" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff">Jared Goff</a> to become a dropback passer.

They <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401326625/cardinals-rams">dominated the Cardinals</a> in the wild-card round, but their three other victories were narrow wins over the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401326634/rams-buccaneers">Buccaneers</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401326636/49ers-rams">49ers</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401326638/rams-bengals">Bengals</a>.

The 4-seed Rams got to play the NFC Championship Game after the 49ers knocked out the 1-seed Packers and 3-seed Cowboys. The Rams got to play the 4-seed in the AFC when the Bengals eliminated the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401326632/bengals-titans">Titans</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401326635/bengals-chiefs">Chiefs</a>, while the second-seeded Bills fell in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/buffalo-bills/post/_/id/36910/bills-watch-victory-slip-away-in-13-seconds-as-chiefs-end-their-postseason-again">"13 Seconds" game</a> at Arrowhead.

One week after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030957/rams-lions">the Lions</a> put their edge rushers as far outside as possible to help force Los Angeles' zone runs back inside, Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's 6-1 front stifled the run game and forced Goff to be a pocket passer. He threw four picks in a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030817/rams-bears">15-6 loss</a>. The Eagles got the Rams again the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030961/eagles-rams">following week</a>, and although Los Angeles came back with two victories against the dismal <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030907/rams-cardinals">Cardinals</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030850/49ers-rams">49ers</a> to end the regular season, warning bells were blaring.</p><p>After <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401038956/cowboys-rams">beating the Cowboys</a> at home, the Rams were bailed out by their defense in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401038118/rams-saints">NFC Championship Game</a> against the Saints. An overwhelmed offense struggled early and handed the Saints an early turnover, but the Rams held New Orleans to two short field goals early before a touchdown drive put them down 13-0. <a data-player-guid="70b6df7b-3187-9baa-b6f7-b9ce5849dc5b" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16716/aaron-donald">Aaron Donald</a> and the defense held the Saints to 10 points over their ensuing seven drives, aided <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/new-orleans-saints/post/_/id/31557/nfl-world-reacts-to-blown-interference-call-during-rams-saints-game">at the end</a> by one of the most famous <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25812050/saints-never-get-blown-pass-interference-call">missed pass interference calls</a> in league history, which gave the Rams time to drive and tie the game in regulation. <a data-player-guid="b609fcba-e177-1906-6da3-f94526248fec" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/7160/john-johnson">John Johnson</a> picked off <a data-player-guid="a3d4f447-3aef-111a-ee5c-4909a8e70a7c" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees">Drew Brees</a> in overtime, and although the offense couldn't do much, <a data-player-guid="f70897fd-7dfa-01bc-6caf-166e058753e9" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14993/greg-zuerlein">Greg Zuerlein</a> hit a 57-yard field goal to send L.A. to its first Super Bowl under McVay.</p><p>There, with two weeks to prepare, Belichick hard-coded the Fangio approach into his defense. McVay and the Rams had no answer. The defense played its best game of the season, holding an excellent Patriots offense to 13 points on 11 possessions, but the Rams never found a way to get the Patriots out of their six-man fronts and couldn't get their dropback pass game going. They punted on their first eight drives and scored three points.

The McVay and Shanahan-style offenses were forced to diversify their run concepts, modernizing what had become the league's favorite way to attack defenses.

Over the final six games of the regular season, they allowed a total of 39 points. In our 25-year window, it's the <a href="https://stathead.com/tiny/DCp1o" target="_new">second-best six-game stretch</a> by points allowed behind a run from the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/pit/season/2000">2000 Steelers</a>, who were playing in a league in which leaguewide scoring was 10% lower than it was in 2014. Colts coach Tony Dungy was sufficiently moved by Wagner's performance to <a href="https://x.com/RobDemovsky/status/561722295585357825">give him an MVP vote</a> for an 11-game season, meaning that Wagner is likely to finish his career with more MVP votes (one) than <a data-player-guid="f0610946-ceb6-9a99-3bcc-cf110b2078b5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a> and the rest of these legendary Seahawks teams combined (zero).</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the Seahawks finished the season as the league's best defense. The offense ranked only 10th in scoring, but it was better by EPA (seventh) and played at a relatively slow pace. Wilson threw for 3,475 yards and added 849 more with six scores as a runner, both of which would become career highs (barring something very unexpected happening with the 2025 Giants). Seattle won its <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400554276/broncos-seahawks">Super Bowl rematch</a> with Denver in overtime, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400554357/cardinals-seahawks">swept</a> the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400554447/seahawks-cardinals">11-5 Cardinals</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400554214/packers-seahawks">dominated</a> a Packers team it would see again in the playoffs with a 20-point victory in Week 1.

Facing the Packers in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400749519/packers-seahawks">NFC Championship Game</a>, Wilson threw four interceptions, only to have his season saved by a <a href="https://grantland.com/the-triangle/afc-nfc-championship-patriots-colts-seahawks-packers/">brutal stretch of in-game decision-making</a> by Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy.

Only the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/kc/season/2018">2018 Chiefs</a>, with Patrick Mahomes and a handful of other future Hall of Famers on offense, got to 27 more often.

I'm well aware of how things ended for the Ravens in the playoffs, but this team outscored its opposition by nearly 12 full points per game while facing the league's seventh-toughest schedule. Playing in a division in which every team posted a winning record, the Ravens comfortably won the AFC North and claimed the top seed in the AFC, blowing out playoff teams such as the Texans (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547396/texans-ravens">25-9</a>), Browns (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547445/ravens-browns">28-3</a>), Lions (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547489/lions-ravens">38-6</a>) and 49ers (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547622/ravens-49ers">33-19</a>) in the process.

The Eagles had been passive and easy to throw on under defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon the season before, and although they had imported <a data-player-guid="8b6e917b-39b0-e82e-13e8-c8b0640b2fa0" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980504/haason-reddick">Haason Reddick</a> in free agency, it was unclear whether they had the defense to challenge opposing quarterbacks.</p><p>Those concerns faded sometime around September. Hurts had an MVP-caliber season, dramatically raising his game as a passer for the second consecutive season while continuing to make a massive impact in the designed run game. He threw for 3,701 yards and 22 scores and added 760 rushing yards and 13 more touchdowns on the ground. A <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35287572/sources-eagles-qb-jalen-hurts-sprained-shoulder">shoulder injury</a> kept him out of two games in December and took him out of the MVP discussion, but he returned and played through the injury in Week 18 to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401437957/giants-eagles">beat the Giants</a> and lock up a first-round bye for the Eagles.</p><p>Roseman's offseason additions were brilliant.

Reddick racked up 16 sacks, one of four Eagles in double digits; Gannon's defense finished with 70 sacks, the most by any team in this 25-year period.</p><p>The Eagles played the league's <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/">third-easiest schedule</a> during the regular season, but they went 14-1 when Hurts started, winning those games by an average of more than 10 points. That trend continued in the postseason, when they got to face a Giants team that had been outscored in the regular season in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401438004/giants-eagles">the divisional round</a> and a 49ers team that lost <a data-player-guid="d2e39a38-732d-5a24-f242-a4f9de87dabe" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361741/brock-purdy">Brock Purdy</a> to an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35559440/source-49ers-qb-brock-purdy-torn-ucl-right-elbow">elbow injury</a> early in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401438009/49ers-eagles">conference title game</a>.

The Eagles won the two home games by a combined score of 69-14.</p><p>A Super Bowl against the Chiefs beckoned, and although Hurts played spectacularly, he dropped the ball on a scramble and handed the Chiefs a 36-yard score on a fumble return.

<b>Offense:</b> 99th percentile<br>
<b>Defense:</b> 35th percentile</p><p>There are two strikes against the 2013 Broncos. One is a defense that gave up 399 points and finished 22nd in scoring, which might be disqualifying if we're comparing them to so many great, well-rounded teams from previous seasons. One good excuse is that they faced the second-most drives (213) of any team; they ranked 18th in points allowed per drive and 17th in defensive EPA per play, leaving them closer to league average than it seems. The other is that they were <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/84042/seahawks-super-bowl-win-a-slam-dunk">shredded by the Seahawks</a> in the Super Bowl, which you'll read more about much later in this column.</p><p>With that being said, this offense was special enough to push those concerns aside. It ranks as the second best of the past 25 years behind the 2001 Rams, driven by what still might be the greatest quarterback season we've ever seen. <a data-player-guid="78d91edb-3223-7991-5793-36664e222d79" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1428/peyton-manning">Peyton Manning</a> threw for 5,477 yards with 55 touchdowns. He took sacks on only 2.6% of his dropbacks. The Broncos had four different receivers catch at least 10 touchdowns, which is ridiculous given that only one other team in history (the 2004 Colts) had as many as three receivers make it to double-digit scores.</p><p>The Broncos topped 35 points 10 times during the regular season, a figure also unmatched in league history. Their three regular-season losses all came in one-score games.

Facing his old playoff rival in the AFC Championship Game, Manning threw for 400 yards and two touchdowns against Belichick and the Patriots, the only time an opposing passer has hit the 400-yard mark in a playoff game against the legendary defensive coach.</p><p>Though they didn't have <a data-player-guid="cb2f0b03-ac0e-cf36-34c0-e590898cab6c" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13976/von-miller">Von Miller</a> for the first six weeks of the season after a suspension, or during the postseason because of a torn ACL, the Broncos might not have won the Super Bowl with <em>five</em> Millers on defense. They were simply overwhelmed by the Seahawks, whose size squeezed the field and Manning's windows to throw. The defense slowed down <a data-player-guid="bfe8805c-d0ae-d234-923c-855ea34f620e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10456/marshawn-lynch">Marshawn Lynch</a>, but it couldn't get much pressure on <a data-player-guid="f0610946-ceb6-9a99-3bcc-cf110b2078b5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a>, and the Seahawks took an interception and a kickoff to the house for return scores.

More than simply stifling opposing teams, the Ravens also served as valuable help for their offense, generating an unbelievable 49 takeaways during the regular season, the most of any team during this 25-year window. They added 12 more across four postseason victories, including five each in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/210114013/ravens-raiders">AFC Championship Game</a> and Super Bowl, a blowout win over New York.</p><p>The offense is the reason this team isn't ranked higher. Even with a dominant defense in place, the Ravens were 5-4 at midseason, averaging just 15.6 points per game on offense. In the middle of a stretch of three games without a touchdown, they replaced <a data-player-guid="b6c0f707-d8e8-b7fd-11c2-7b185dce6f50" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/927/tony-banks">Tony Banks</a> with <a data-player-guid="ec9b8d20-2af3-2efa-91ab-fc47948b576d" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/649/trent-dilfer">Trent Dilfer</a> and leaned into 21-year-old rookie running back <a data-player-guid="d9e2d830-a88d-204e-7c97-5708ab235c92" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2136/jamal-lewis">Jamal Lewis</a>, who averaged 26 carries per game over the remainder of the season while closing out a series of victories.

If you just treat them as the Dilfer-led team that dominated in the second half and into their postseason at their best, they're closer to a top-10 team. If you treat them as some combination of that team and the one that struggled to score touchdowns early in the season, they fall here. I'm choosing to take the broad approach for each team, trying to sample what they were like throughout the season as opposed to just focusing on their peak.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ind.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2>12. 2007 <a data-clubhouse-guid="582d14eb-da61-e505-cc40-d972a1b60ed1" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> (13-4)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Lost in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280113011/chargers-colts">divisional round</a> to Chargers 28-24<br>

The Colts ranked third in the league on offense, but with Bob Sanders winning <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story?src=desktop&amp;id=3184997">Defensive Player of the Year</a> in his final full season, they led the NFL in scoring defense.

The easy schedule makes it difficult to place this squad ahead of other Brady-Belichick teams, but I wouldn't want to have to try to put away these Pats from the other sideline.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/lar.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2>10. 2001 <a data-clubhouse-guid="2e1473b2-e269-fd7a-1137-c1edacb85986" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams">St. Louis Rams</a> (16-3)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Lost in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220203017/rams-patriots">Super Bowl XXXVI</a> to Patriots 20-17<br>
<b>Offense:</b> 100th percentile<br>
<b>Defense:</b> 75th percentile</p><p>Yes, the Rams had the best offense of the past 25 years by this methodology. Even including their playoff run, they averaged 31.3 points, 5.5 more than any other team in 2001. They did this <i>despite</i> turning the ball over 44 times during the regular season, the second most of any team. Turnovers were really the only way to beat them for most of the year; their two regular-season losses came in games in which they coughed up the ball a combined 14 times. When they merely turned the ball over four times or fewer, they went 16-1.</p><p>Unlike the 2000 Rams, whose defense collapsed after a championship run in 1999, the 2001 Rams also had a great D. All those turnovers left them in vulnerable positions from short drives, as Lovie Smith's unit faced the fifth-worst average starting field position of any team in the league. A <a data-player-guid="d3402595-a9a9-9aa6-40be-0bd181ff4e14" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1621/leonard-little">Leonard Little</a>- and <a data-player-guid="68a56595-5542-10a3-9968-e63ea549d950" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/177/aeneas-williams">Aeneas Williams</a>-led unit forced 34 turnovers in the regular season, then eight more in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220120014/packers-rams">divisional round win</a> over the Packers. (It was a different time.) The defense held a high-powered Eagles team to 24 points in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220127014/eagles-rams">conference title game</a>, coming up with a late stop to set up a trip to the Super Bowl.</p><p>And, well, a dynasty started there, just not the one St. Louis fans were expecting. The Rams weren't able to overcome their sloppiness on the biggest stage as three turnovers led to New England's first 17 points, including a pick-six by <a data-player-guid="bffc9561-a9dc-b336-1000-61e27a04b743" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/793/ty-law">Ty Law</a>. A second defensive touchdown was called back for a holding penalty. The Rams couldn't force any turnovers, and after a late drive to tie the score, they couldn't get Tom Brady &amp; Co. off the field. The Patriots drove 53 yards in 74 seconds to set up the first of Adam Vinatieri's Super Bowl-<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs01/news/2002/0203/1322259.html">winning kicks</a>.</p><p>Even with the loss in the title game, I'm still putting the 2001 Rams ahead of the 2001 Patriots given that they were a better team for the vast majority of the season. (They beat the Pats during the regular season <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/211118017/rams-patriots">24-17</a>, although that game obviously mattered quite a bit less than the rematch.) And yet, it's only fair to point out that the Rams could be their own worst enemy at times, with that coming back to bite them in the biggest game. In a current era in which the average team turned the ball over just under 21 times in 17 games last season, it's tough to imagine a team with 44 turnovers in 16 games not having that come back to bite them more often. That's a testament to how great the 2001 Rams were when they didn't give up the ball and a reminder of what kept them from confirming their status as one of the greatest teams ever.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/kc.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2>9. 2019 <a data-clubhouse-guid="f68f2343-8ceb-7a02-740d-af6338be21d2" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a> (15-4)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Won <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401131047/49ers-chiefs">Super Bowl LIV</a> over 49ers 31-20<br>

In the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401131044/titans-chiefs">AFC title game</a>, the Titans went up 10-0 in the first quarter before the Chiefs answered back, with a Patrick Mahomes scramble before halftime giving them a lead they wouldn't relinquish. Then, having struggled for most of the Super Bowl against the 49ers, the Chiefs converted a third-and-15 for 44 yards and scored three touchdowns in the final 6:13, speeding away from yet another deficit with what ended up as a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28624233/barnwell-super-bowl-liv-andy-reid-masterpiece-how-chiefs-came-back-49ers-blew-it">relatively comfortable victory</a>.</p><p>Kansas City wasn't always playing from behind, of course.

A defense that had been 28th in points allowed per drive in 2018 jumped to 13th.

They lost four games during the regular season, and although one was with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11128/matt-moore">Matt Moore</a> at quarterback for an injured Mahomes, they also lost three of their four games against the AFC South, including a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128053/colts-chiefs">defeat to a Colts team</a> that would finish 7-9. Unlike the Eagles, who have fielded three truly dominant teams, three above-average ones and a disaster over the past eight seasons, the Chiefs have been consistently great without ever fielding a truly overwhelming squad, which makes it harder for them to do well in this exercise.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/gb.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2>8. 2010 <a data-clubhouse-guid="06cd3bcf-7a86-53d4-28e7-aa049dd36261" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</a> (14-6)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Won <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/310206009/steelers-packers">Super Bowl XLV</a> over Steelers 31-25<br>

Most of the difference between those two teams was close-game luck. The 2010 Packers went 4-6 in one-score games during the regular season, continuing what had been a frustrating start in narrow contests early in Rodgers' career. They then won three one-score games on their way to the Super Bowl and went 5-1 in those same contests during the 2011 season. Including the postseason, they won their games in 2010 by an average of 9.7 points and their games in 2011 by an average of 10.8. The two teams were more similar than their records suggest.</p><p>Rodgers had a better 2011 season, but he took a massive leap forward halfway through the 2010 campaign. Through a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/301031020/packers-jets">Week 8 game</a> against the vaunted Jets defense, Rodgers ranked eighth in QBR, with the future Hall of Famer throwing nine picks and completing 61% of his passes. From Week 9 onward? He led the NFL in QBR, threw 25 touchdown passes against four picks, averaged a league-leading 8.9 yards per attempt and increased his completion percentage by nearly 10 full points. He had three sterling starts during the postseason, although he was bailed out of a rough <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/310123003/packers-bears">NFC Championship Game</a> against the Bears when <a data-player-guid="0929f9fb-f84f-c278-09aa-42a850ec5b11" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9597/jay-cutler">Jay Cutler</a> was injured, and Green Bay spent most of the game against <a data-player-guid="87c74181-32b9-6879-6671-cc9a11a0620e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11540/caleb-hanie">Caleb Hanie</a> and <a data-player-guid="ba3ea6e2-6a4a-3f3e-0acd-3ec75710fd3a" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/735/todd-collins">Todd Collins</a>.</p><p>And though Rodgers was better in 2011, the defense was superior in 2010.

The 2003 Patriots were much more like the dominant New England teams that would mark many of their other Super Bowl runs, just with the sides flipped. Tom Brady had a solid season and finished third in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1698744">MVP voting</a>, but this was another early-2000s title winner driven by a dominant defense.

After the Patriots missed the playoffs in 2002, the same skeptics who weren't impressed by Belichick's run in Cleveland were ready to write him off as an overmatched coach.</p><p>Well, the Patriots went 17-1 the rest of the way, including a 15-game win streak through the Super Bowl. Over that run, they went 10-0 against teams that won at least 10 games during the regular season, becoming the only team in NFL history to win double-digit games against double-digit winners.

At 11-2 and with a win over one of their rivals atop the NFC, the Eagles were still in good position to claim the top spot in the conference. When Foles threw four touchdown passes and Philadelphia blocked three kicks in his first start -- a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400951808/eagles-giants">34-29 win</a> over the Giants -- it felt like the Eagles could continue steamrolling their competition.</p><p>Forgotten is what happened next. Foles and the Eagles limped through an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400951719/raiders-eagles">ugly victory</a> over a limited Raiders team, taking the lead with 23 seconds left on a day in which he went 19-of-38. With the top seed clinched, Foles started <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400951759/cowboys-eagles">the following week</a> but was pulled for <a data-player-guid="d54bf1c2-52c3-e7ab-4a86-073d8e862704" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2979501/nate-sudfeld">Nate Sudfeld</a> after going 4-of-11 for 39 yards. In the divisional round, Foles and the offense scored just 15 points, including a critical field goal at the end of the first half. That kick came on a drive in which he sailed a would-be interception several yards over his receiver's head, only for it to <a href="https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/video/highlight-wide-receiver-torrey-smith-makes-immaculate-reception-esque-c-20248656">bounce off the knee</a> of a Falcons defender and into the arms of <a data-player-guid="b3d4827d-44bd-1bf1-f03a-5d7d7db3c18a" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14032/torrey-smith">Torrey Smith</a>, who turned it into a 20-yard catch. The Eagles then came up with a stop on the 2-yard line with 1:05 to go to seal a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400999179/falcons-eagles">15-10 victory</a>.</p><p>From that point on, Foles was dominant. He threw for 352 yards with three scores in a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/Barnwellx180122/2017-nfl-playoffs-mystery-philadelphia-eagles-quarterback-nick-foles">blowout win</a> over a 14-4 Vikings team in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400999174/vikings-eagles">NFC Championship Game</a>. And while the most memorable moment of his Super Bowl will always be that <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/22326781/inside-philly-special-gutsiest-play-calling-super-bowl-history-doug-pederson-philadelphia-eagles">fourth-down touchdown catch</a> on the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22349822/philadelphia-eagles-quarterback-nick-foles-suggested-trick-play-philly-special-coach-doug-pederson">Philly Special</a>, Foles went 28-of-43 for 373 yards and three scores in the biggest game of his life. His two most productive receivers on the day were <a data-player-guid="a733d6f0-17f6-7be3-3c3d-950fc30df6bd" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045260/corey-clement">Corey Clement</a> and <a data-player-guid="8be61cb9-4548-edd6-badb-7ba8c90818d5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971618/nelson-agholor">Nelson Agholor</a>. On a day in which Tom Brady threw for 505 yards and three touchdowns, the Eagles needed Foles to be brilliant. He was nearly perfect.</p><p>This was a deep, talented football team with plenty of homegrown talent. Like the 2024 edition, the Eagles got some help from unexpected places. Clement had a big game in the Super Bowl, joining a backfield that included low-cost additions in LeGarrette Blount and <a data-player-guid="1b58dca6-ee7f-3c0b-6154-737516ab05d8" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573300/jay-ajayi">Jay Ajayi</a>. <a data-player-guid="81116fa6-0747-6ba3-6b27-5af0ac983c19" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11236/chris-long">Chris Long</a>, who joined Blount in leaving the 2016 Patriots for the 2017 Eagles and winning rings in both places, added valuable depth to the defensive line rotation.

And of course, Foles had already nearly retired after his struggles with the Rams before <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/18896973/nick-foles-returning-philadelphia-eagles-two-year-deal">returning to the Eagles</a> to play behind Wentz. These Eagles might not have had the same caliber of star power on offense as the 2024 team, but with a bit of perspective this squad looks more similar than I had remembered.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2>4. 2024 <a data-clubhouse-guid="d1a9b001-1df7-fbd7-ae4c-6ca7065286ec" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> (18-3)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Won <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671889/chiefs-eagles">Super Bowl LIX</a> over Chiefs 40-22<br>

If we were leaving aside the first quarter of the season, I'd say they would have a reasonably strong case as the best team of the past 25 years. Before the bye, they went 2-2, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671691/falcons-eagles">blowing a late lead</a> over the Falcons and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671740/eagles-buccaneers">getting overwhelmed</a> by the Buccaneers in Tampa. They <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671805/packers-eagles">won a sloppy affair</a> in Brazil over the Packers and needed a third-and-16 catch-and-run by <a data-player-guid="de06715d-5216-76ee-f063-dabb342c4225" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121023/dallas-goedert">Dallas Goedert</a> for 61 yards with 1:16 left to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671736/eagles-saints">avoid losing</a> to the Saints. Through four weeks, the Eagles ranked 26th in defensive EPA per play.</p><p>Afterward, with rookie <a data-player-guid="9c7274f7-268c-3559-b6eb-fec3738c9c65" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4682618/cooper-dejean">Cooper DeJean</a> moving into the lineup as the team's slot corner, the Eagles were the league's best defense by EPA per snap. They were fifth best on offense. They proceeded to go 16-1 over the rest of the season into the playoffs, winning their games by an average of 14 points. Though the Rams came within 13 yards of ending their run with a late comeback in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671937/rams-eagles">the divisional round</a>, the Eagles <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671888/commanders-eagles">stomped the Commanders</a> in their rubber match a week later and then <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43772100/super-bowl-2025-how-eagles-dominated-chiefs-mahomes-hurts-defense-barnwell">ripped apart the Chiefs</a> in the Super Bowl, going up 40-6 before a pair of garbage-time touchdowns.</p><p>The story of the season was <a data-player-guid="94486c18-dd3e-6081-a3fe-4a26b71ddcdc" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley">Saquon Barkley</a>, who put together <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42857976/saquon-barkley-sets-eagles-single-season-rushing-mark">one of the best seasons ever</a> by a running back.

After the Eagles turned the ball over eight times during the first four games of the season, they had only eight more across their remaining 17 contests.</p><p>Realistically, you can make a strong case the Eagles were two drops away from going 20-1. In Week 2, Barkley <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41295933/eagles-saquon-barkley-shoulders-blame-game-changing-drop">dropped a pass</a> that would have allowed them to run the clock out, with Philadelphia kicking a field goal before <a data-player-guid="53bec012-c2ed-bc7c-a8d5-438611f9faa1" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins">Kirk Cousins</a> drove the length of the field for a winning score. Then, in Week 16, <a data-player-guid="79fe15c5-5f05-f939-c4f5-c55466521a50" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241478/devonta-smith">DeVonta Smith</a> dropped a pass with 2:07 to go that would have allowed the Eagles to run the clock down before kicking a short field goal to go up five. Instead, <a data-player-guid="f03f3238-b035-6f0e-5844-1529ca021c3a" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426348/jayden-daniels">Jayden Daniels</a> got the ball back and drove the length of the field for a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671717/eagles-commanders">winning touchdown</a>.</p><p>And yet, at the same time, the Eagles weren't always dominant against some middling opposition. They nearly lost to the Saints before that Goedert third-and-forever conversion. They <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671714/browns-eagles">beat the Browns</a> by only four, needed a red zone interception with 1:13 to go to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671797/jaguars-eagles">beat the Jaguars</a> and were lucky to escape Carolina <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671713/panthers-eagles">with a win</a> after an open <a data-player-guid="a286b774-0d65-9813-67aa-945ba3567e4e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430034/xavier-legette">Xavier Legette</a> dropped a would-be touchdown that should have given the Panthers a lead in the final minute.</p><p>In time, those narrow victories fade into history, and we remember each team's best moments. At their best, on the biggest stage, the Eagles were ruthless and overwhelming. They deserve to be considered as one of the best teams of the past 25 years right now, and they might look even better with some perspective down the line.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ne.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2>3. 2004 <a data-clubhouse-guid="0078f353-fe3e-67ed-a42c-43cca0568e21" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> (17-2)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Won <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/250206021/patriots-eagles">Super Bowl XXXIX</a> over Eagles 24-21<br>

Though its winning streak was disrupted by a midseason <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/241031023/patriots-steelers">loss to the Steelers</a> and its December interrupted by an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/241220015/patriots-dolphins">inexplicable collapse</a> in a loss to a Dolphins team that would finish 4-12, the Patriots were otherwise brilliant on both sides of the ball.</p><p>They did it against stiff competition. By my model, including the postseason, this was the second-toughest schedule any team has faced over the past 25 years, trailing only the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/nyj/season/2000">2000 Jets</a>. The Patriots faced both a 12-4 Colts team and a 15-1 Steelers squad twice, winning three of those four contests. They dominated both of those teams in the postseason, topping the Colts <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/250116017/colts-patriots">20-3</a> in the divisional round before enacting revenge on the Steelers, who were on a 14-game winning streak of their own, with a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/250123023/patriots-steelers">41-27 victory</a>. They then controlled the Super Bowl against a 13-3 Eagles team before a late score made things look close.</p><p>Though Brady wasn't quite at the heights he would hit in 2007 and beyond, the offense was taken to the next level by the addition of <a data-player-guid="aebf5c90-84c2-da79-57ff-b1c0a57fb48a" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1196/corey-dillon">Corey Dillon</a>, who ran for 1,635 yards and 12 scores. The defense forced turnovers on a league-high 20% of possessions and added 10 more turnovers in three games during the title run. Vinatieri was nearly perfect, missing just two of the 96 kicks he attempted between the regular season and playoffs. This was a truly impressive and complete team, albeit one that gets a bit lost in the shuffle between the other victories and the drama of 2007.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/sea.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2>2. 2013 <a data-clubhouse-guid="3767a23c-a17d-294f-288a-9086ad1f0680" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> (16-3)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Won <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/sea/season/2013">Super Bowl XLVIII</a> over Broncos 43-8<br>

Seattle basically had more cap space than it knew what to do with, which led to the signing of <a data-player-guid="0bc63611-867e-642c-09b1-5a987ef4e89c" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11326/cliff-avril">Cliff Avril</a> and <a data-player-guid="7266d0dc-4c5d-94d4-6913-fed7d56282b5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12762/michael-bennett">Michael Bennett</a> and trading a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/9044913/percy-harvin-officially-traded-seattle-seahawks">first-round pick</a> for <a data-player-guid="c74aa771-9f29-15f4-ecea-e109d42e56fe" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12569/percy-harvin">Percy Harvin</a>.</p><p>I won't fault you for picking the 2013 Seahawks as the best defense of the past 25 years; they were the fourth best by this measure, while EPA has them as the eighth-best unit since 2008. They're going to send three players to the Hall of Fame in Wagner, Sherman and Wilson, and they were deep enough along the line of scrimmage to have Avril and Bennett in situational pass-rush roles. They forced 39 turnovers and scored four touchdowns. They inspired a defensive revolution among teams that tried to emulate their single-high approach and failed.</p><p>The difference between these Seahawks and the other dominant defenses, like the 2000 Ravens and 2002 Bucs, is that the offense was better. This team had <a data-player-guid="bfe8805c-d0ae-d234-923c-855ea34f620e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10456/marshawn-lynch">Marshawn Lynch</a> running for 1,257 yards and 12 touchdowns before adding 288 yards and four more scores during the playoff run. Wilson averaged 8.2 yards per attempt, threw for 3,357 yards and added 539 more yards on the ground, all while making a sensibly priced sedan (just under $31,000) per game. Harvin and <a data-player-guid="9c996d52-b7ee-7b86-89c5-5821e8594519" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10488/sidney-rice">Sidney Rice</a>, nominally the team's top two wideouts on paper because of their contracts, combined for 16 catches during the regular season because of injuries. <a data-player-guid="5ad37ed5-c6cb-694a-2aaf-f37ac92ae07b" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13217/golden-tate">Golden Tate</a>, <a data-player-guid="9a3e88e3-9129-a3c8-6367-1de5411a849a" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14221/doug-baldwin">Doug Baldwin</a> and <a data-player-guid="87f962af-ad29-a58b-e05e-35320f7feeed" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15428/jermaine-kearse">Jermaine Kearse</a> stepped in and held their own.</p><p>You can't poke many holes in what this team accomplished. The run to the Super Bowl required a fourth-quarter comeback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/340119026/49ers-seahawks">against the 49ers</a> and a late interception by <a data-player-guid="6a88bd78-7c15-0e91-c747-4605eb3f7fc5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14214/malcolm-smith">Malcolm Smith</a> (via Sherman) to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhtfaME_v0Y" target="_new">send them to the title game.</a> There, the Seahawks delivered a performance every bit as dominant as the one we saw from the Eagles <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671889/chiefs-eagles">earlier this year</a>, manhandling a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/den/season/2013">Broncos team</a> that came into the game off a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38492638/denver-broncos-peyton-manning-nfl-record-606-points-2013-season">606-point regular season</a>. The Broncos snapped the ball into the end zone for a safety on the opening snap and didn't get much better from there, as they didn't have any answers for Seattle's physicality. Denver's lone scoring drive came while trailing 36-0 in the third quarter.</p><p>The only reason this Seattle team isn't No. 1? It was sloppy at times during the regular season. The Seahawks went to overtime to beat the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/330929034/seahawks-texans">2-14 Texans</a> and the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/331103026/buccaneers-seahawks">4-12 Buccaneers</a>, needed a goal-line stop on the final snap to beat the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/331028014/seahawks-rams">7-9 Rams</a> and gave up 34 points to the Colts in an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/331006011/seahawks-colts">early-season defeat</a> at home. The offense went missing in a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/331222026/cardinals-seahawks">late-season loss</a> to the Cardinals. This is nit-picking, but the margins at the very top are thin. This was a special team, and I went back and forth with the idea of picking them to top the list. Very narrowly, though, if I had to pick one team to beat them, I'd lean toward the best version of the quarterback and the franchise that got them to the Super Bowl the following season.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ne.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2>1. 2007 <a data-clubhouse-guid="0078f353-fe3e-67ed-a42c-43cca0568e21" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> (18-1)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Lost <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280203017/giants-patriots">Super Bowl XLII</a> to Giants 17-14<br>

Would this even be a debate if <a data-player-guid="4a6d749a-1b0c-6fee-6456-6e9ce381037d" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4578/asante-samuel">Asante Samuel</a> caught <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOKT5KI2oTg">that interception</a> on the final drive? If <a data-player-guid="52069eb3-9563-e8d4-0df4-d3c3e1bed572" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4669/david-tyree">David Tyree</a> didn't bring in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlyBEJ60Duc">Helmet Catch</a>? Of course not. Samuel didn't and Tyree did, and it's why these Patriots aren't the most successful team of the past 25 years, even if they came within moments of being the first 19-0 team in league history.</p><p>We're using how each team played over the full season to evaluate their chances of winning in a new season, though, and there's no contest there. Even if we factor in what the Giants did during the playoffs and give them extra credit for beating the Patriots when it mattered most, that team <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/nyg/season/2007">lost six times</a>, including a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/271125019/vikings-giants">24-point loss</a> to the Vikings with <a data-player-guid="fc975ce1-f6fe-f202-4161-b8ea62daed32" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9650/tarvaris-jackson">Tarvaris Jackson</a> under center. They <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/271229019/patriots-giants">lost to the Patriots</a> in Week 17 in a game in which they famously were <a href="https://www.giants.com/news/2007-regular-season-finale-new-england-patriots-tom-coughlin-john-madden">trying their hardest</a> to compete, even with nothing to play for. Those games also matter in evaluating their true level of talent.</p><p>Over a full year, it's tough to find a team that can realistically compete with the 2007 Pats, even with Super Bowl wins on their résumé. They were the only one-loss team of the era. They had the largest average margin of victory (17.5 points) by more than a field goal over the next-best team. The 2000 Ravens were the only team with a better pythagorean expectation over the regular season and postseason combined.</p><p>You remember (or have heard about) the offense, but the defense wasn't too shabby, either. The Patriots ranked sixth in EPA per play and fourth in points allowed per drive. The defense contributed six touchdowns during the regular season, which seems almost unfair given what the offense was doing on a weekly basis. Getting to play from ahead as often as they did obviously made life easier for <a data-player-guid="9414efae-23dd-bc6c-1925-bb2f42c0b1e6" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1257/mike-vrabel">Mike Vrabel</a> &amp; Co., but even with win probability constraints on their performance and measure what they did when each team had at least a 20% chance of winning, New England ranked fourth in third-down conversion rate and QBR allowed.</p><p>The Patriots' schedule ended up being tougher than you might remember. Before the Giants loss, they won all eight of their games against 10-plus win competition, prevailing by an average of nearly two touchdowns. Things were a little friendlier in the postseason when they got to face a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280120017/chargers-patriots">Chargers team</a> without <a data-player-guid="59049c9e-de83-4d26-dbb0-5e9ffe94186e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2553/ladainian-tomlinson">LaDainian Tomlinson</a> for much of the day while <a data-player-guid="a7d4c3f1-4297-af47-1b05-c8fa86cc815e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5529/philip-rivers">Philip Rivers</a> played through a <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/292302/that-time-philip-rivers-played-through-a-torn-acl-in-the-playoffs">torn ACL</a>. The Super Bowl gave them the 4-seed in the NFC, thanks to the Giants knocking out <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280113006/giants-cowboys">two</a> <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280120009/giants-packers">13-win teams</a> along the way. That seemed easy until it wasn't.</p><p>To be fair, the Patriots slipped a bit as the season went along. They needed a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/271125017/eagles-patriots">fourth-quarter comeback</a> to beat an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2704/aj-feeley">A.J. Feeley</a>-led Eagles team as 24.5-point favorites in Week 12, then some questionable calls and a touchdown pass with 48 seconds to go to top a 5-11 Ravens team <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/271203033/patriots-ravens">the following week</a>. They weren't great against that compromised Chargers team in the AFC Championship Game, with Brady throwing three picks. And while they might have been unlucky to have the Giants fall on all three fumbles in the Super Bowl, Tom Coughlin's team beat them up on the line of scrimmage and was hardly lucky to win.</p><p>I've already <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20284825/the-tom-brady-bill-belichick-shift-how-2007-new-england-patriots-super-bowl-spygate-changed-everything">written at length</a> about the stylistic and schematic legacy of that 2007 team, so I won't reiterate all that again. I'm not considering aesthetic impact here, but it's tough to pick another team that was more influential or striking on the league to come. The 2007 Patriots did everything except win a Super Bowl. If you put them against every other team on this list on a neutral field, I believe they're the team that would take home a title.</p>
