        <p>Former <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/">Cleveland Browns</a> quarterback and Heisman winner <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824921/johnny-manziel/">Johnny Manziel</a> has played in various professional football leagues since <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/johnny-manziel-doesnt-seem-likely-to-land-on-an-nfl-team-in-2016-after-his-release-from-the-browns/" target="_blank">his memorable NFL flameout</a></span> in 2016, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/johnny-manziel-is-reportedly-ready-to-attempt-his-nfl-comeback-again/" target="_blank">but never has he received an opportunity at a re-do</a></span> of sorts at the game's highest level.</p><p>Battling through a bipolar disorder, substance abuse and an unwillingness to follow franchise rules set for him, the Browns released <a href="https://247sports.com/longformarticle/johnny-manziel-untold-review-what-to-expect-in-netflixs-tell-all-documentary-213239042/" target="_blank">Manziel ahead of his third NFL season, and his career never recovered</a>.</p><p>Manziel recently considered a comeback, a decade after his last in-game appearance with the Browns in 2015.</p><p>"I asked myself this question last year," Manziel said this week on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo08iEDSWA8" target="_blank">Logan Paul's "Impaulsive" podcast</a>. "Got myself into a mindset of like, 'OK, I'm going to go start working out again, throwing the football around, see if I can still get myself in shape.'"</p>
        

<p>After making appearances in several pro leagues since — including the CFL and AAF — Manziel was only interested this time around in returning to the pinnacle of football.</p><p>"I remember calling my agent, being like, 'I think I'm gonna try and make a comeback.' He's like, 'OK, we'll start talking with some guys, UFL, XFL,'" Manziel said. "And I'm just sitting there thinking like, 'There's no way I'm going back to f***ing play in one of these early leagues ... UFL ... XFL ... Anything like that.'"</p><p>Manziel told Paul he "hated Cleveland," and leaving College Station and his native Texas was a culture shock of sorts at the next level. At the time, Manziel <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/johnny-manziel-recounts-troubles-with-browns-says-he-watched-zero-film-during-time-in-cleveland/" target="_blank">was more interested in partying</a></span>&nbsp;than improving as a football player and understanding the responsibilities of being a professional athlete.</p>
        

<p>Manziel has previously acknowledged he wasn't interested in watching film or game plan prep and felt "empty" with the Browns.</p><p>Manziel went 2-6 as the starter in his NFL career and completed 57% of his passes for 1,675 yards, seven touchdowns and seven interceptions to go along with 259 rushing yards and another score. That wasn't what anyone expected from <a href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">college football</a>'s best player over his previous couple years at Texas A&amp;M as a difference-maker in the SEC.</p><p>"I would sit in my condo in Cleveland downtown and just feel like it was the only place that I could get away from everybody and anything," <a href="https://247sports.com/longformarticle/johnny-manziel-untold-review-what-to-expect-in-netflixs-tell-all-documentary-213239042/" target="_blank">Manziel said during Netflix's "Untold" series</a> detailing his tumultuous career in 2023. "And I would look out those windows every day and I just felt empty. I went from one fishbowl city to another, and I wanted nothing to do with football. I wanted nothing to do with stepping on that field. And I had bigger issues in my life than being able to go out and play free-spirited, flowing football."&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Manziel told Paul this week he hasn't given up on a comeback, but understands that's likely out of the cards.</p><p>"As much as I would like to think that that's something I can do, I think at 32, my chances are probably pretty chopped," Manziel said.</p>
