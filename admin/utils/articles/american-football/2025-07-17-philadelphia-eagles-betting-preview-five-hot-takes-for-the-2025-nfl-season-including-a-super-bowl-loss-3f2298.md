<p>The Philadelphia Eagles have won two Super Bowls in the last eight years, including a 40-22 triumph over the Kansas City Chiefs last season. The Eagles once again look primed for a championship run and will enter the 2025 NFL season as the betting favorites at +650 (risk $100 to win $650) to win Super Bowl 60. Despite their standing as the top team in the 2026 Super Bowl odds, there are still numerous longshot futures bets available for the Eagles heading into the 2025 regular season.&nbsp;</p><p>Longshot bets, or betting hot takes, typically come with NFL odds that would imply the bet is unlikely to hit. One example of a betting hot take for the Eagles in 2025 would be taking Saquon Barkley to go over 1,000 rushing and 1,000 receiving yards during the regular season. DraftKings Sportsbook offers this bet at +4000 odds, and given that Barkley's best receiving season came as a rookie in 2018, backing this bet would qualify as a hot take.&nbsp;</p><p>SportsLine expert handicapper Jimmie Kaylor has broken down the latest <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/" target="_blank">betting</a> trends and NFL futures odds on the <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">best betting apps</a></span> and locked in five betting hot takes for the Eagles in 2025. Before locking in any futures bets for the Eagles of your own, you'll want to see what Kaylor has to say. New users can even take advantage of the&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/" target="_blank">DraftKings promo code</a></span>&nbsp;offering <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport" target="_blank" rel="sponsored mtech">$150 in bonus bets instantly with a $5 wager</a>.</p><p>Kaylor posted a 55-34-4 record on NFL point spread and over/under picks during the 2024 season, profiting 15.78 units ($1,578 for a $100 bettor). Here are his five hot takes:</p><h2>The Eagles will score 1+ rushing touchdown in all 17 regular season games</h2><p>This prop is available on DraftKings and is currently priced at +600. The Eagles were a dominant rushing team in 2024, scoring 29 touchdowns on the ground. The combination of running back Saquon Barkley and quarterback Jalen Hurts gives Philadelphia arguably the premier red zone rushing attack in the NFL. With the 'Tush Push' still legal, this feels like a great value. New users can use a <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/" target="_blank">DraftKings promo code</a></span> to get even more value. Bet it now and <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport" target="_blank" rel="sponsored mtech">get $150 in bonus bets instantly with a $5 wager</a>:</p><h2>The Baltimore Ravens will beat the Eagles in Super Bowl 60</h2><p>This exact Super Bowl outcome futures bet is currently priced at +2800. I've already listed the Ravens as my early favorite to win Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara next February, and the Eagles are still the team to beat in the NFC in my eyes. There is a long season to play and a lot could happen between now and February. That said, this is what i feel is the most likely Super Bowl outcome today, and +2800 offers a great value. Bet it now at Fanatics Sportsbook and <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanatics&amp;c=sport" target="_blank" rel="sponsored mtech">get up to $1,000 in no-sweat bets</a>:</p><h2>The Eagles will be the only NFC East team in the NFL Playoffs</h2><p>The Eagles are listed at -375 to make the Playoffs on FanDuel. Many experts expect the Washington Commanders to be among the top contenders in the NFC, making them the biggest threat to this hot take not becoming a reality. This exact prop bet wasn't available at the time of publication, but you can parlay the Giants (-1500), Cowboys (-240), and Commanders (+112) to all miss the postseason for a payout of +328. New users can use a <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/" target="_blank">FanDuel promo code</a></span> to get even more value.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jalen Hurts will lead the NFL in rushing touchdowns</h2><p>There has never been a quarterback lead the league in rushing touchdowns, but Hurts is set up nicely to make a run at accomplishing the feat in 2025. The 26-year-old has scored 10 or more rushing touchdowns in four straight seasons, including a career high 15 in 2023. Hurts finished with 14 rushing scores in 2024, which was only two behind league leaders Derrick Henry, James Cook, and Jahmyr Gibbs. Hurts is currently listed at +550 on this prop market at BetMGM. New users can use a <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/" target="_blank">BetMGM promo code</a></span> to get even more value with <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&amp;c=sport" target="_blank" rel="sponsored mtech">$150 in bonus bets after a winning $5 wager</a>:</p><h2>Jalen Carter will win NFL Defensive Player of the Year</h2><p>Carter had a breakout season in 2024, and is one of the most physically gifted players the NFL has ever seen. The former Georgia standout reminded me of a bigger version of future Hall of Famer Aaron Donald in his second professional season, and was one of the main reasons the Eagles were able to shut down the Chiefs' offense in Super Bowl 59. If Carter successfully builds off his 2024 season, he will emerge as a contender for this honor. FanDuel currently has this prop priced at +2200 if you want to <a href="https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&amp;c=sport" target="_blank" rel="sponsored mtech">bet it now</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Looking for more football picks?</h2><p><strong>The SportsLine Projection Model has revealed and is constantly updating its Fantasy football cheat sheets. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07162025_agg_cbssports_football_NFL_kaylor_EaglesHotTakes" target="_blank">Visit SportsLine now to see the top Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts, and busts, all from the model that outperformed human experts in 2024</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
