Christmas starts in July, is four weeks long and comes with a present nearly every single day: That your favorite third-string receiver made a tough snag over the middle in double coverage; that the undersized, small-school undrafted pass rusher is once again terrorizing the backup offensive line; that everybody -- and I mean <i>everybody</i> -- is in the best shape of his life.</p><p>It's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/">NFL</a> training camp, folks. And it's right around the corner, with veteran players for the Chargers and Lions reporting to camp later this week, ahead of the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44816997/chargers-lions-meet-2025-pro-football-hall-fame-game">Hall of Fame Game</a> on July 31.</p><p>There's little I look forward to more than the first video to hit my timeline of a few star players jogging out onto the practice field. Perhaps the only thing I cherish more are answers to the following questions, winners of the following positional battles, health for the following injuries and updates on the following rookies.

There is no question about this, none at all. Two of his best acts with the Lions have been as follows: hiring Aaron Glenn as defensive coordinator, and promoting Ben Johnson to offensive coordinator after his <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30766148/sources-lions-hire-ex-chargers-coach-anthony-lynn-offensive-coordinator">first hiring</a> (Anthony Lynn) <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33036043/anthony-lynn-detroit-lions-offensive-coordinator">didn't work out</a>.</p><p>Those are the only moves Campbell has needed to make at coordinator over his four years in Detroit -- a rare thing for a team as successful as the Lions have been. After years of interest, both Glenn and Johnson have finally taken head coaching jobs elsewhere, which raises a few questions. The first: Just how good is Campbell's eye for coaching talent? New DC Kelvin Sheppard was <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43562932/lions-promote-lbs-coach-kelvin-sheppard-dc">promoted</a> from the linebackers coaching job, but Campbell first worked with him back in 2014-15, when Sheppard was still a player on the Dolphins. He's been the defensive coordinator-in-waiting for a while now. What does Campbell see in him? And will that vision be realized?</p><p>On the offensive side of the ball, where plenty of candidates for internal promotion were available (Hank Fraley, Tanner Engstrand, Antwan Randel El), Campbell went for an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43598107/lions-working-hire-broncos-john-morton-oc-sources-say">external hire</a> in John Morton. There is some familiarity there, as Morton spent the 2022 season as the Lions' senior offensive assistant. Does he have a particularly strong relationship with <a data-player-guid="987f4f39-ed6f-5915-57eb-ec7dc356171c" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff">Jared Goff</a>, who will need to shoulder a greater load now that Johnson has left the building? Can Morton bring the same creativity, the same situational excellence that powered the Lions' fourth-down approach of seasons past?</p><p>The Lions are transitioning from a rebuilt upstart to a bona fide force, and that means they must combat brain drain. This is Campbell's first crack at replacing key staff departures, and getting it right is critical to completing the total team turnaround.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="31"></p><h2>What does <a data-player-guid="7e9fbd60-951e-2d9a-8d8c-b3f1ab6c4a4d" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields">Justin Fields</a> do with this (last) chance?</h2><p>When Fields <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39747346/sources-bears-trading-qb-justin-fields-steelers">finally got out</a> of Chicago last season, I was thrilled for him. Few franchises have been worse at QB development over the past several seasons than the Bears. The Steelers are another such candidate, as they have struggled to modernize their offensive approach or flood their roster with pass catchers for a young quarterback. Of course, Fields joined Pittsburgh as a backup behind <a data-player-guid="f0610946-ceb6-9a99-3bcc-cf110b2078b5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a>, and he started only six games while Wilson recovered from a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41853236/steelers-russell-wilson-preparing-get-ready-go-vs-jets">calf injury</a>.</p><p>Rather surprisingly, the Jets gave him a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44194622/jets-reach-2-year-40m-deal-qb-justin-fields-sources-say">starter's deal</a> and an unimpeded path to the QB1 job. The Jets are another candidate for our "even worse than the Bears at quarterback development" list, but it's a new staff in New York -- namely, head coach Aaron Glenn and offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand. Both came from Detroit, and Glenn in particular watched his defenses get ravaged by Fields' legs twice a season. Fields' last three games as a Bear against Glenn's defense: 12 carries for 58 yards and a touchdown; 10 carries for 132 yards; 13 carries for 147 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>Now, the Jets have few pass catchers behind <a data-player-guid="da106063-995d-eaf0-54e4-ccecd5e90767" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson">Garrett Wilson</a>, but they have a pretty solid offensive line. I don't think they'll tip their hand (and put Fields in harm's way) too much during training camp, but I'll be watching the reports closely. And I won't be surprised if we see a 2022-like season for Fields. Back then, he posted 160 carries for 1,143 yards, the second most <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35361863/bears-cite-experience-keeping-justin-fields-lopsided-loss">all time</a> for a quarterback. If he can replicate that season with his legs, while getting more passing game help from Engstrand and Wilson than he ever got in Chicago, there just might be something there.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/min.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="31"></p><h2>What is <a data-player-guid="460fbf74-c64d-3862-b942-852d104e94dd" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4433970/jj-mccarthy">J.J. McCarthy</a> ready for?</h2><p>There isn't a training camp question with a bigger range of outcomes than the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45523859/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-quarterback">McCarthy question</a> in Minnesota. I can draw two parallel universes for you. In the first, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45375201/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-justin-jefferson">a year of rehab</a> gave McCarthy the opportunity to prepare mentally, and he is accordingly as sharp as a tack under center -- no rookie mistakes. Fully <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44919491/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-nfl-draft">physically recovered</a>, he offers more on the boot than Darnold ever did, creating a new layer in the already dangerous Vikings offense. Minnesota hits the ground <i>running</i>.</p><p>In the other, Minnesota really does hit the ground running because McCarthy isn't ready. He is <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44921044/qb-jj-mccarthy-know-ready-start-vikings">uncertain on the knee</a> and still adjusting to NFL speed, and it's not like he was a pass-heavy maven in college either. The Vikings heavily rely on a retooled offensive line, as well as a running back by committee with <a data-player-guid="ca688cbe-b781-01a6-69f2-eb87420aec83" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360569/jordan-mason">Jordan Mason</a> joining <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042519/aaron-jones-sr">Aaron Jones</a>.

McCarthy next season</p><p>Harry Douglas, Kimberley A. Martin and Damien Woody discuss what will make a successful season for J.J. McCarthy and the Minnesota Vikings.</p></div></div><p>These two worlds, and every world in between, feel possible for the Vikings. We shouldn't overreact to anything we get in training camp, especially negative. The McCarthy we get in August won't be the McCarthy we see in December, as a season's worth of NFL action teaches some big lessons. But the Vikings are in a competitive division and harbor deep playoff aspirations. They only have so much leash to give a rookie, especially when you consider how easily Kevin O'Connell has made veteran quarterbacks shine in this offense. McCarthy's health and confidence are about as big of a July storyline as you get in the NFL.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/cin.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="31"></p><h2>What happens with <a data-player-guid="7ab1c7ee-fd75-435d-b0c5-613879216083" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052743/trey-hendrickson">Trey Hendrickson</a> and <a data-player-guid="ee8dca16-7ec4-3fa6-8c10-6cc028cd1802" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685562/shemar-stewart">Shemar Stewart</a>?</h2><p>I remain confident that the two most obvious things will happen in Cincinnati: The Bengals will <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45362772/nfl-bengals-trey-hendrickson-contract-holdout">reach an extension</a> with Hendrickson that makes him a top-three highest-paid defensive player in football, and they will give Stewart the rookie contract language <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45498593/source-shemar-stewart-leaves-bengals-minicamp-amid-contract-dispute">he seeks</a> so he can start practicing.</p><p>However, there's a not-insubstantial (excellent writing there; I'm a professional) chance at least one of these takes a left turn. Hendrickson seems to have more internal locker room support for a prolonged holdout than any other player I can remember. Everyone in a Bengals uniform knows he has carried that defense for a long time, and in no season was that more obvious than last year. If Hendrickson flatly rejects every offer the Bengals give him and tries to reinvigorate trade markets as other teams reevaluate their rosters during training camp, I will be surprised. But not shocked.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45500644/nfl-bengals-shemar-stewart-contract-holdout-trade-college">Stewart situation</a> feels tied to the Hendrickson situation. If Hendrickson is holding out (or holding in, as that's the method these days), then the Bengals will swiftly revert their rookie contract language and get Stewart practicing -- they need him even more than they thought. But what if the Hendrickson deal gets done before camp? I can see the Bengals "losing" the Hendrickson negotiation (i.e., paying him a bajillion dollars), and digging their heels in on the Stewart contract as a result.</p><p>Again: I still strongly believe we're going to get the expected outcome on both of these deals, but I'm not counting my chickens just yet.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/hou.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="31"><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/tb.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="31"></p><h2>Can Nick Caley get it going? And can Josh Grizzard keep it going?</h2><p>With every offseason, it feels like new offensive coordinators have bigger and bigger leverage in surprising team outcomes. Compare the 2024 Eagles to the 2023 Eagles if you don't believe me -- a playcaller can just as easily tank a humming offense as he can resurrect a fallen one.</p><p>In the latter case this season, we have <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43680408/texans-hiring-rams-nick-caley-new-oc-source-says">new Texans offensive coordinator</a> Nick Caley, who inherits a Texans offense that fell from lofty expectations in 2024. Houston's approach to pass protection proved far too rudimentary, and opposing defenses easily found pressure schematically. They found it against personnel as well, so the Texans retooled their offensive line accordingly.</p><p>It's easy to poke holes in the 2025 Texans' offensive personnel. Rookie receivers fill the depth chart behind <a data-player-guid="338aa0be-bd63-1a24-1929-796af121cefb" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4258173/nico-collins">Nico Collins</a>. <a data-player-guid="0c22d637-c0d7-6bac-7333-dc3a992bdc0d" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895856/christian-kirk">Christian Kirk</a> is returning from a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42042587/sources-jaguars-wr-christian-kirk-broken-collarbone">collarbone injury</a>; <a data-player-guid="dd36357c-436b-f059-d957-ddbb12cf33ab" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4366031/tank-dell">Tank Dell</a> <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44125809/texans-wr-tank-dell-undergoes-another-surgery-knee">might not be back</a> this season at all. The offensive line is young and shuffled. But I remember how explosive this offense was in 2023 when the playcalling was sharp, and the core of that success -- <a data-player-guid="147e6862-2ac0-3a97-8f36-e3b1c0147320" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432577/cj-stroud">C.J. Stroud</a> and Collins -- remains. I'm bullish on a Texans offensive bounce-back, so long as Caley is as billed.</p><p>On the other hand, Josh Grizzard isn't looking to rebound, but sustain. The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43796736/tampa-bay-buccaneers-offensive-coordinator-josh-grizzard-wizard">new offensive coordinator</a> in Tampa Bay, Grizzard steps into Liam Coen's shoes as the playcaller for <a data-player-guid="5bb4376a-d089-e3e4-e49a-44f1d709a012" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield">Baker Mayfield</a> and a Bucs offense that returns every single starter from last season (and adds <a data-player-guid="48fb595b-ecda-3de2-9c05-fcc8090c4b84" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567750/emeka-egbuka">Emeka Egbuka</a>, a first-round wide receiver from Ohio State). But Grizzard has never called plays before, and he was a fast riser through the Dolphins' offensive ranks before his one season as the Buccaneers' passing game coordinator last season. What's his DNA?</p><p>The Bucs were one bounce away from a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401671883">wild-card win</a> over the Commanders last season, and that was with an injury-riddled defense. If they are healthier on that side of the ball, they look like a bona fide NFC contender ... so long as you assume the offense doesn't take a step back with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43551022/tampa-bay-buccaneers-liam-coen-jacksonville-jaguars-head-coach-happened">Coen's departure</a>.

Richardson initially injured his throwing shoulder in 2023 on a scramble and aggravated that AC joint during practice in May. Coach Shane Steichen put no timetable on a return, but reports indicate he'll be ready for training camp.</p><p>If Richardson can throw unimpeded during training camp, we have ourselves a real battle. Jones, who signed a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44206117/qb-daniel-jones-finalizing-1-year-deal-colts-sources-say">one-year deal</a> in March, is a known commodity -- a low-end starting quarterback with some rushing ability but little arm talent to elevate a passing game. Richardson, who has missed 17 games with injuries in his first two seasons, still has the requisite physical talent to not just win the starting job but also become a highly dangerous NFL QB.

The ideal outcome is that Williams suddenly returns to his pre-injury form, though it's worth remarking that even his career-best season (2021, rookie year) was only 4.4 yards per attempt and a 46.3% success rate. But Blue is a speedy change-of-pace back, so steady production from Williams -- an excellent pass catcher -- could be complemented by some big Blue plays.

On paper, he is the most talented wide receiver in New England. But he's 31 years old, coming off an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42074896/texans-wr-stefon-diggs-season-torn-acl">ACL tear</a> and has already enjoyed some <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45487425/patriots-stefon-diggs-deflects-personal-boat-video-questions">off-field shenanigans</a> this offseason. Last year's leading receiver was <a data-player-guid="71ece68a-acb1-12a8-cce6-9331bdea0f83" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4427095/demario-douglas">DeMario Douglas</a>, who put up 621 yards on 66 catches as a primary slot receiver. (Technically, tight end <a data-player-guid="aa4d3e91-bafe-5ffe-bae4-36e00386dd19" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046439/hunter-henry">Hunter Henry</a> led the Patriots with 674 yards, but that's rather depressing, and we're only talking about the receiver room right now.)</p><p>Douglas is just OK at slot receiver. Among 27 players who ran at least 60% of their routes from the slot last season, he ranked 17th in yards per route run and 19th in first downs per target. That's not prolific enough to have a stranglehold on that role, and any smart usage of Diggs includes a decent diet of slot routes. There's also the wrinkle of rookie third-round pick <a data-player-guid="359ec99e-3714-88dc-c5de-1dc522b8369f" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4252364/kyle-williams">Kyle Williams</a>, a 5-foot-11, 190-pound speedster who -- you guessed it -- deserves some snaps in the slot.</p><p>Diggs and Williams can play on the outside, and probably should to some degree.

Then, in Week 14, he <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42893482/jerry-jones-demarvion-overshown-right-knee-surgery">tore the ACL, PCL and MCL</a> in his right knee -- less than two years after an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38229440/source-cowboys-lb-demarvion-overshown-torn-acl">ACL tear</a> in his left knee robbed him of his rookie season.</p><p>Overshown should be one of two starting linebackers under new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, but when exactly he gets back on the field is something to monitor. He gave a bullish update on his health to the <a href="https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/demarvion-overshown-on-injury-rehab-learning-from-matt-eberflus-more">Cowboys team site</a> in May: "I think it really couldn't be any better. If it was better, I'd probably be out there playing right now. Where I'm at in my rehab, in my process, it's where I'm supposed to be plus some."</p><p>That sounds rosy, but expect the Cowboys to be cautious with Overshown (as one should be with a player who tore three ligaments in one knee). Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said in April the team does not expect Overshown to start the season, and local reporters have tagged November as a likely window to return. I'd be stunned if we see him do much during camp, but if he really is ahead on his rehab, we could see the rumblings in August of an early return to action.</p><hr><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="31"><h2><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567962/jermaine-johnson">Jermaine Johnson</a>, Edge, <a data-clubhouse-guid="732d3caf-b350-1e34-48c6-b7cebb4a0d88" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a></h2><p>Johnson played his way into the Pro Bowl with a breakout 2023 season, and expectations were sky high for 2024.
