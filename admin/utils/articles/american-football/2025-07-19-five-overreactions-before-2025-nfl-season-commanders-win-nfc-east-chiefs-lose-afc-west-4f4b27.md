The Lions and Vikings combined to win 29 games, dueling until the final game of the regular season to decide not only the division title, but the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. The Packers went 11-6 with the youngest roster in the league. Four of those losses were to the Lions and Vikings, and another was to the eventual Super Bowl champion Eagles.</p><p>The Bears? Well, they went 5-12, but things should be different this season with former Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as their head coach. They also made a bunch of offensive personnel changes that <i>should</i> help kick-start the development of 2024 No. 1 pick <a data-player-guid="dd15176c-3004-333f-beaa-149216c42968" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431611/caleb-williams">Caleb Williams</a>.</p><p>Johnson didn't jump from the division's best team to its worst team thinking about a long-term rebuild. The Bears want to be a factor right away. And with a rebuilt offensive line, a couple of new skill players on offense and Dennis Allen coaching the defense, you can see how they might be. Since 2020 -- the first season in which the NFL's expanded playoff format made it possible -- no division has sent all four of its teams to the playoffs in the same season. But it's bound to happen at some point, and this division looks loaded.</p><p><b>The verdict: OVERREACTION</b></p><p>Chicago's the key to making this happen, but it still seems a little bit too soon with its current roster. The Bears play 10 games against teams that made last season's playoffs, plus games against the Cowboys and Bengals, who should be improved. Tough schedule, tough division. And even if the Bears do break through this year, their success is likely to come at the expense of at least one of their division rivals.</p><p>As for the rest of the NFC, the Eagles still look awesome. The Commanders appear primed to build on last season's surprise <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671888/commanders-eagles">NFC Championship Game</a> run. The 49ers should bounce back and challenge the Rams in the NFC West. Quarterback <a data-player-guid="5f09781b-6b0b-7325-049b-a91e60d794e6" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott">Dak Prescott</a>'s return could make Dallas a factor in the always-unpredictable East. Heck, maybe the NFC South could get more than one team. ... OK, sorry. That's taking it too far. But the point is, it's not as if there aren't playoff-caliber teams elsewhere in the conference. It's going to be tough for the North to get four teams in.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/kc.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true" width="31"></p><h2>The Chiefs' streak of nine straight AFC West titles will come to an end</h2><p>Here's another division in which three teams made last year's playoffs.

There's a lot of speculation that one of those guys could get traded between now and the start of the season. But even if that happens, it'll still be a crowded room with more questions than answers.</p><p>Odds are that one of the veterans -- Flacco or Pickett -- will open the season as the starter. But given the Browns' history at the position and that most teams use more than one starting quarterback per season, it's fair to assume the Week 1 starter won't necessarily be the same in Week 17.</p><p><b>The verdict: NOT AN OVERREACTION</b></p><p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44841310/jaguars-trade-no-2-pick-travis-hunter-nfl-draft">The trade</a> the Browns made with the Jaguars to allow Jacksonville to move up to draft <a data-player-guid="c39cf8be-f94e-3db4-9c3a-fcc72135a03f" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685415/travis-hunter">Travis Hunter</a> left Cleveland with an extra first-round pick in the 2026 draft. At that point, there will be just one year left on Watson's contract and the team surely will have moved on from the idea of him as its long-term future (if it hasn't already).</p><p>With two first-rounders in a draft that's expected to be better at QB than this year's, the Browns will need to go into next offseason with some certainty about who they already have on the roster. Even if Flacco or Pickett opens the season as the starter, Cleveland needs to find out what it has in third-round pick Gabriel or fifth-round pick Sanders. It seems like an absolute slam-dunk that at least three quarterbacks will start games for the Browns this season.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/wsh.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true" width="31"></p><h2>It's the Commanders' turn to win the NFC East</h2><p>Not much was expected of the Commanders last season, but they were one of the great surprises. Led by new head coach Dan Quinn and rookie quarterback <a data-player-guid="f03f3238-b035-6f0e-5844-1529ca021c3a" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426348/jayden-daniels">Jayden Daniels</a>, the Commanders won their final five games of the regular season (including one against the Eagles) to make the playoffs as a wild card. Then they upset the Buccaneers and Lions to advance to the NFC Championship Game.</p><p>Washington's 12-5 record put the team only two games behind Philadelphia, and they traded for veterans such as left tackle <a data-player-guid="0634573a-c005-bef4-552c-bc7dfd85b082" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051890/laremy-tunsil">Laremy Tunsil</a> and wide receiver <a data-player-guid="7f300cb7-f0a1-a43a-d0b0-f8a57bf04eb3" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126486/deebo-samuel-sr">Deebo Samuel Sr</a>. in an effort to take the next step and maximize Daniels' rookie-contract window. The Eagles still look phenomenal and deservedly will open as the division favorites, but no team has repeated as NFC East champion since 2004.

The year before that streak started, they won the Super Bowl from a wild-card spot.</p><p>Tampa Bay has quietly been one of the most consistently good teams in spite of tons of changes, and Mayfield's career resurgence has been a major reason for that. The Bucs got him for next to nothing before the 2023 season, then rewarded him with a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39702094/source-buccaneers-baker-mayfield-agree-3-year-100m-deal">three-year, $100 million</a> contract prior to the 2024 season.</p><p>After this year, Mayfield will have one year and $27 million left on his deal. He's only 30 years old, and if he leads the Bucs to a fifth straight division title with yet another new offensive coordinator, you have to believe he'll be in line for an even bigger extension this time around.</p><p><b>The verdict: NOT AN OVERREACTION</b></p><p>The Falcons look like the top challenger, but they couldn't unseat the Bucs last season even after beating Tampa Bay in both head-to-head matchups.

But it would be unfair to believe the Bucs don't have the ability to solve their own problems. Mayfield found a home in Tampa Bay and has been consistently productive since he got there. The Bucs deserve to be the division favorites. And if they win it again, Mayfield will have a strong case for a big raise.</p>
