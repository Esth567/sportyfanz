        <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/">New York Yankees</a> star <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/">Aaron Judge</a> added another impressive accomplishment to his collection in Saturday's loss against the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/">Chicago Cubs</a> (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/boxscore/MLB_20250712_CHC@NYY/">box score</a>), launching his 35th home run of the season and the 350th of his career.&nbsp;</p><p>That second part is notable since it made Judge the quickest in Major League Baseball history to the 350-homer mark, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamessmyth621.bsky.social/post/3lts3zyauck2s" rel="nofollow">according to YES Network researcher James Smyth</a> -- and not by a small margin:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Player</th><th>Team</th><th><a href="https://cbssports.com/mlb/">MLB</a> G</th><th>Date</th></tr><tr><td><p>Aaron Judge</p></td><td><p>Yankees</p></td><td><p>1,088</p></td><td><p>July 12, 2025</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mark McGwire</p></td><td><p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/">Athletics</a></p></td><td><p>1,280</p></td><td><p>June 2, 1997</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2209465/juan-gonzalez/">Juan Gonzalez</a></p></td><td><p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/">Tigers</a></p></td><td><p>1,298</p></td><td><p>June 3, 2000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alex Rodriguez</p></td><td><p>Yankees</p></td><td><p>1,301</p></td><td><p>May 4, 2004</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Harmon Killebrew</p></td><td><p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/">Twins</a></p></td><td><p>1,319</p></td><td><p>June 6, 1967</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Judge's milestone home run came in the ninth inning against Cubs reliever <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2823660/brad-keller/">Brad Keller</a>, breaking up the shutout by plating himself and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/">Cody Bellinger</a>. Here's a look:</p>
        


<p>Judge, 33, entered Saturday batting .354/.462/.725, good for a 226 OPS+ that would remarkably establish a new career-high. He had also homered 34 times and driven in 79 runs. His contributions were worth an estimated 6.6 Wins Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.</p><p>Judge continues to trail <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/">Seattle Mariners</a> catcher <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/">Cal Raleigh</a> for both the major league and American League home-run leads. <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mariners-star-cal-raleigh-bashes-pair-of-home-runs-to-move-within-one-of-all-star-break-record/" target="_blank">Raleigh homered twice on Friday</a></span>, giving him 38 on the year. Those two figure to spend the rest of the summer jockeying for position in the AL Most Valuable Player Award voting.</p>
        

<p>The Yankees, with Saturday's loss, are now 53-42 on the season. They entered the day two games behind the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/">Toronto Blue Jays</a> in the American League East. The Blue Jays will take on the Athletics tonight: a Toronto win will leave the Yankees three back entering the final day of the first half of the season.&nbsp;</p>
