        <p>The Washington Nationals have selected Oklahoma prep shortstop Eli Willits with the No. 1 pick in Major League Baseball's amateur draft.</p><p>Willits, whose father Reggie played in the majors and now coaches at Oklahoma, was ranked as the best prospect in the class by CBS Sports. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/2025-mlb-draft-rankings-top-30-players-in-class-including-eli-willits-kade-anderson-ethan-holliday-more/">Here's what we wrote</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Willits is considered to be the other prep shortstop with big-league bloodlines near the top of the class, but I ranked him aggressively in the spring and I see no reason to not do the same here. Reggie's son is a surefire shortstop with all the necessary weaponry to be a plus or better defender at maturation. He's also a promising switch-hitter with strong bat-to-ball and zone-management skills (though he seems unlikely to get to even average power). As an added bonus, Willits won't celebrate his 18th birthday until December -- studies have shown that such competence at a young age tends to bode well for the player's long-term outlook. I don't know that he'll go No. 1, but I would be shocked if he's available outside of the top five.</p></blockquote><p>Willits is the third No. 1 pick in Nationals franchise history. Washington chose atop the draft in both 2009 and 2010, selecting ace Stephen Strasburg and outfielder Bryce Harper. He's also the youngest No. 1 overall pick in MLB Draft history and the youngest player in the draft overall.</p><p>"Just the high contact rate, the plate discipline, the patient ABs with the true switch-hit profiles becoming more valuable in this game," Nationals scouting director Danny Haas told reporters after the pick (via <a href="https://x.com/spencernusbaum_/status/1944528068368048266" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Washington Post</a>).</p>
        

<p>The Nationals' selection comes a week after they dismissed both general manager Mike Rizzo and field manager Davey Martinez. Washington named assistant GM Mike DeBartolo as their interim lead executive.</p>
