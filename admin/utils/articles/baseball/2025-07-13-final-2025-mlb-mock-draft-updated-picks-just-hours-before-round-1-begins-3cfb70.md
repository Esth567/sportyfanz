Washington Nationals </strong></h2><p><strong>Kade Anderson, LHP, LSU<br>
Rank: 1</strong></p><p>There have been a lot of rumors flying around over the last few days about what is happening in the wake of the firing of GM Mike Rizzo.</p><p>The industry feeling is that what has changed is 1) Anderson is a little more likely to be the pick mostly because Ethan Holliday is a little less likely to be the pick and 2) taking a bigger cut is now a real option, with Eli Willits the main cut-rate option, though Aiva Arquette has also been mentioned.</p><p>All but Willits are advised by Scott Boras, and he'll never tip his hand until he has to; now is not the time yet. Nothing is decided here and price will be a factor. If I turned this in 15 minutes before the draft, the Nats may still not have made the decision, so I'll stick with what seems most likely, even if I don't feel great about it. Landon Harmon is a rumored later round, overslot target.</p><p>For context, a scouting director for a team picking in the top 10 said I shouldn't feel confident about anything happening in the top-three picks specifically, adding "I'm hearing there's wars happening in all of those rooms right now," as of Friday night. I ran that by another director picking up high: "Yeah, we're hearing the same thing."</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>2. Los Angeles Angels </strong></h2><p><strong>Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee<br>
Rank: 6</strong></p><p>I'm going to stick with Doyle because he makes the most sense for what the Angels have proven they're looking for in recent drafts: a polished, quick-moving college player that will come at a savings.</p><p>I've heard at least six players seriously connected to this pick in the last few days: Anderson, Doyle, Arnold, Arquette, Ike Irish and Willits. There are a couple more I've been told are under consideration who I'm not taking seriously as options here.</p><p>It could be any of these players based on final conversations and bonus pricing info on each player coming in at the last minute. Doyle has a real shot to slide to No. 9 or No. 10 if he doesn't go here, so he is motivated to give a competitive number.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45698124" data-cerebro-id="686dca3dd5fb3860ccc891a4" data-title="Liam Doyle's MLB draft profile" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45698124">play</span><figcaption><p>0:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Liam Doyle's MLB draft profile</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains what makes Tennessee's Liam Doyle one of the top prospects in this year's MLB draft.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sea.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>3. Seattle Mariners </strong></h2><p><strong>Seth Hernandez, RHP, Corona HS (CA)<br>
Rank: 4</strong></p><p>The hot rumor of the last few days is Tyler Bremner will be the pick here at big savings and that holds up to further analysis because, in style, Bremner and Seth Hernandez (long connected to this pick) are pretty similar.</p><p>It's pretty widely known that Kade Anderson is the No. 1 player for Seattle and will be the pick if he gets here, which still has maybe a 20-30% chance of happening.</p><p>If Anderson isn't here, I think the decision comes down to Bremner at the most savings, Irish at a little less savings or Seth Hernandez at the least savings, broadly speaking. Some sources have said Arquette, Arnold and Kyson Witherspoon are also in play here, but feel like tertiary options.</p><p>I think Bremner having more support in the No. 11-No. 15 area that was reflected in the last mock will raise his price a bit to where Hernandez will be the pick, but this one is also wide open at the moment and will come down to a last-minute bonus price check if Anderson isn't available.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/col.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>4. <a data-clubhouse-guid="f3f1ba71-05f1-a49a-0363-3b1d8e0db4cf" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies">Colorado Rockies</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Ethan Holliday, 3B, Stillwater HS (OK)<br>
Rank: 2</strong></p><p>There has been some waffling late in the process from sources who think maybe the Rockies wouldn't pay the overslot price to get Holliday down here -- but much of what I hear very late in the process is wrong or intentional misinformation, so I'll stick with what I've been hearing for a literal year.</p><p>I think the other options for Colorado if Holliday doesn't get here are all college pitchers: Anderson, Arnold, and Witherspoon, with Willits and Arquette getting some mentions.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45704884" data-cerebro-id="686efa12ac2b6424ea61f30d" data-title="Ethan Holliday's MLB draft profile" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45704884">play</span><figcaption><p>1:10</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Ethan Holliday's MLB draft profile</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains what makes Ethan Holliday one of the top prospects in this year's MLB draft.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/stl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>5. <a data-clubhouse-guid="c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Eli Willits, SS, Fort Cobb-Broxton HS (OK)<br>
Rank: 3</strong></p><p>Willits now seems securely in play at the top two picks and possibly at No. 4, so the Cardinals landing him here would now be considered a solid outcome. I think Anderson and Holliday are the primary targets for this pick and Willits is next up, with Arnold and Irish as the possible underslot options.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/pit.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>6. <a data-clubhouse-guid="5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Jamie Arnold, LHP, Florida State<br>
Rank: 5</strong></p><p>It now sounds like Seth Hernandez or Eli Willits will be the pick if he's here, so the Pirates are rooting for Seattle to either land Anderson or opt for a cheaper alternative to Hernandez.</p><p>Otherwise, JoJo Parker, Arnold, Arquette and Irish are believed to be the four leading options here. Arnold has the most late support, but this one may also come down to money.</p><p>I hope you feel sympathy for me having to do this in public when none of these teams know what they're doing and won't for hours.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45698129" data-cerebro-id="686dcac07bd3d32baee891ac" data-title="Jamie Arnold's MLB draft profile" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45698129">play</span><figcaption><p>1:05</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Jamie Arnold's MLB draft profile</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains what makes Florida State's Jamie Arnold one of the top prospects in this year's MLB draft.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mia.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>7. <a data-clubhouse-guid="74909d10-eacb-1376-ef1e-d0f37d7c67ca" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins">Miami Marlins</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>JoJo Parker, SS, Purvis HS (MS)<br>

Rank: 9</strong></p><p>I think the Jays would pick Parker if he gets here and would consider Arnold along with Arquette and Irish if he is still available here. This decision seems to come down to Arquette or Irish, with Carlson and Witherspoon also under consideration.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cin.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>9. <a data-clubhouse-guid="04b65a0b-3cca-d795-0e21-23606470418a" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Steele Hall, SS, Hewitt-Trussville HS (AL)<br>
Rank: 13</strong></p><p>Cincinnati seems to be the floor if Hernandez or Doyle slip and otherwise the Reds seem to be the ceiling for Hall. I think Irish, Witherspoon and Carlson are also in the mix.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/chw.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>10. <a data-clubhouse-guid="8f4800c6-3c05-b3d5-8186-9750cd72a3c2" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox">Chicago White Sox</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Billy Carlson, SS, Corona HS (CA)<br>
Rank: 8</strong></p><p>Carlson's range seems to be No. 7 to No. 12, maybe No. 14.

Rank: 18</strong></p><p>Bremner is picking up steam at this pick, and I think his floor is now Boston's pick at No. 15. It's a bit surprising he could go ahead of Witherspoon, but Bremner clearly has been getting interest in the top half of the first round that just hadn't leaked out to the industry at large until late. I think this will be a college player, likely a pitcher, with Witherspoon and Summerhill also mentioned here a lot.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tex.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>12. <a data-clubhouse-guid="4fa2cf46-09fc-255f-74a1-2a8857b0e671" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers">Texas Rangers</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Kayson Cunningham, SS, Johnson HS (TX)<br>
Rank: 25</strong></p><p>I think Steele Hall and Billy Carlson are the targets here, but neither makes it to the pick, so Cunningham becomes the pick, narrowly over Josh Hammond. I was hearing Cunningham would fit more 20-30 and in the late chatter is that he has multiple homes in the teens. Like the White Sox, the belief all spring is the Rangers want a prep hitter here.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sf.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>13. <a data-clubhouse-guid="e072b79c-4fa1-3a55-bdcd-4d7d9734d79b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-giants">San Francisco Giants</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Ike Irish, RF, Auburn<br>
Rank: 11</strong></p><p>Irish is in play at most picks starting at No. 2 all the way down to the middle of the first round, but I think his slide would stop here. The Giants have long been tied to Marek Houston and Charles Davalan (a longshot at this pick, but gone by their next one), with Andrew Fischer getting some love, as well.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tb.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>14. <a data-clubhouse-guid="f8a579c6-08b9-7584-141d-317d0645763b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Kyson Witherspoon, RHP, Oklahoma<br>
Rank: 10</strong></p><p>The Rays are tied to prep position players for later picks and could pull a shocker, as I projected in my previous mock, by taking Jaden Fauske here.</p><p>I think Hall, Billy Carlson and Cunningham are the main targets and none of them are available in this projection. Witherspoon is from Florida and is a great value, while the Rays still have a chance to land Fauske at their next pick.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bos.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>15. <a data-clubhouse-guid="c6df06f6-785d-3900-4935-5fd13742e2ee" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox">Boston Red Sox</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Gavin Fien, 3B, Great Oak HS (CA)<br>
Rank: 12</strong></p><p>I'll stick with Fien here as one of the steadiest projections all spring.

Rank: 20</strong></p><p>I'll stick with Kilen here as he fits the type of prospect they have targeted for a while.

Rank: 17</strong></p><p>I think the Cubs are targeting in-game power here, and Hammond makes a lot of sense. They've scouted Quentin Young pretty hard this spring, as well, but this is too early for that kind of risk. Xavier Neyens, Wehiwa Aloy and Wood all fit, as well.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/ari.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>18. <a data-clubhouse-guid="43e14a76-ff66-49ed-24fc-2835932f99dd" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Marek Houston, SS, Wake Forest<br>
Rank: 22</strong></p><p>I think Cunningham is the target here, but he isn't available in this scenario. Hammond and Bodine are also mentioned here and I think Slater de Brun will be the selection at Arizona's next pick.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bal.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>19. <a data-clubhouse-guid="9ca473b8-e73e-a33d-8ea0-b4d160be4be7" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Jace LaViolette, CF, Texas A&amp;M<br>
Rank: 21</strong></p><p>LaViolette should go in one of the next three picks and fits Baltimore's style.

Rank: 19</strong></p><p>Hammond seems to be the target, but doesn't make it to K.C. in this edition. I think the Royals will take a prep pitcher with one of their high picks, likely either Watson or Fisher, and maybe another later on Day 1.
