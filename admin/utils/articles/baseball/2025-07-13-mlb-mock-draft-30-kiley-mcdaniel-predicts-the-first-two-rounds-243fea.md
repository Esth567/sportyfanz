Washington Nationals </strong></h2><p><strong>Kade Anderson, LHP, LSU</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 1</strong></p><p>There is a lot of uncertainty at this pick after the firing of GM Mike Rizzo. The effect, if you believe the buzz in the industry, is that Anderson is now a little more likely to be the pick. I think it stands at about a 55% chance it will be Anderson, 35% for Ethan Holliday and 10% for Eli Willits/others.</p><p>Willits and maybe Liam Doyle seem to be the leading cut-rate options rather than prep ace Seth Hernandez, which may be another effect of interim GM Mike DeBartolo rather than Rizzo being at the helm.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>2. Los Angeles Angels </strong></h2><p><strong>Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 6</strong></p><p>Doyle has been tied here for a while, and with good reason: He would probably take a below-slot deal and he is a strong candidate to be first player to the big leagues in this entire class. Given his dominating fastball, he could get big league hitters out right now, and the Angels may be aggressive and let him do just that, then see if they can make him a long-term starter.</p><p>Kade Anderson seems like the top guy on the Angels' board, though, and thus probably would be the pick here if he doesn't go No. 1. In this scenario, I think this decision will come down to Doyle, Jamie Arnold or bigger cut versus slot-in Ike Irish. I give Doyle the slight edge.</p><p>The Angels love Daniel Pierce but likely can't land him. Keep an eye on Mason Pike and Sam Horn as the starter targets along with basically any college arm with reliever risk at later picks: Brian Curley, Cade Obermueller, Chase Shores, Tanner Franklin, A.J. Russell, Lucas Kelly and Mason Morris.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45698124" data-cerebro-id="686dca3dd5fb3860ccc891a4" data-title="Liam Doyle's MLB draft profile" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45698124">play</span><figcaption><p>0:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Liam Doyle's MLB draft profile</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains what makes Tennessee's Liam Doyle one of the top prospects in this year's MLB draft.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sea.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>3. Seattle Mariners </strong></h2><p><strong>Seth Hernandez, RHP, Corona HS (CA)</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 4</strong></p><p>The tide seems to be turning with the Mariners now good with taking Hernandez here, despite the spotty outcomes of prep righties in the draft, after canvassing a wide group of players.</p><p>Jamie Arnold would be the runner-up and I think Kade Anderson is the top player on their board, so those three are the main targets.

<strong>Rank: 2</strong></p><p>It has been long rumored, maybe since the night of the draft lottery at the MLB winter meetings, that Holliday wouldn't get past this pick, both because of team preference and his father Matt's history in Colorado.</p><p>If Holliday doesn't go No. 1 to the Nationals, this is very likely his landing spot -- and I wouldn't be surprised if he got the biggest bonus in this draft and the biggest bonus in this draft era to engineer this outcome for the Rockies.</p><p>If Holliday does go No. 1 overall, Kade Anderson and Jamie Arnold are believed to be the other main options here, likely in that order. If all three of those players go ahead of the Rockies, I think it would be Kyson Witherspoon or possibly Aiva Arquette as the pick.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45704884" data-cerebro-id="686efa12ac2b6424ea61f30d" data-title="Ethan Holliday's MLB draft profile" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45704884">play</span><figcaption><p>1:10</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Ethan Holliday's MLB draft profile</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains what makes Ethan Holliday one of the top prospects in this year's MLB draft.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/stl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>5. <a data-clubhouse-guid="c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Eli Willits, SS, Fort Cobb-Broxton HS (OK)</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 3</strong></p><p>I think the Cardinals' board looks quite similar to mine, with Kade Anderson and Ethan Holliday in the top two spots, then Willits third. I think he'll be the pick here in this scenario, but the other primary options would be a near coin flip with Jamie Arnold, or a slight cut with Ike Irish.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/pit.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>6. <a data-clubhouse-guid="5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Aiva Arquette, SS, Oregon State</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 9</strong></p><p>It sounds like the Pirates will take Seth Hernandez here, if he doesn't go No. 3 to the Mariners. As a secondary plan, I think Pittsburgh is leaning toward a college hitter. Arquette has been mentioned here for months, with Ike Irish as the alternative, and pitcher Jamie Arnold another target if he gets here.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mia.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>7. <a data-clubhouse-guid="74909d10-eacb-1376-ef1e-d0f37d7c67ca" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins">Miami Marlins</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>JoJo Parker, SS, Purvis HS (MS)</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 7</strong></p><p>I think Miami is looking to land Eli Willits and has Parker as a backup option with Jamie Arnold as a target if he slips. I'll lean Parker over Arnold here but I think, in this scenario, those two players go in these next two picks in some order. Billy Carlson, Ike Irish and Andrew Fischer seem like the other backup options.</p><p>Keep an eye on Mason Pike, Will Rhine and Hunter Allen at later picks.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tor.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>8. <a data-clubhouse-guid="0151aed9-9f11-ceae-195d-180ca603b64a" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Jamie Arnold, LHP, Florida State</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 5</strong></p><p>Arnold entered the year as the top prospect on my board but was hit a little harder than expected, so the takes from teams vary a bit more than you'd expect. Like I said above, I think JoJo Parker and Arnold go back-to-back in this scenario, but Arnold has a real chance to go No. 2 or No. 3. Ike Irish and Kyson Witherspoon are secondary options.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45698129" data-cerebro-id="686dcac07bd3d32baee891ac" data-title="Jamie Arnold's MLB draft profile" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45698129">play</span><figcaption><p>1:05</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Jamie Arnold's MLB draft profile</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains what makes Florida State's Jamie Arnold one of the top prospects in this year's MLB draft.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cin.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>9. <a data-clubhouse-guid="04b65a0b-3cca-d795-0e21-23606470418a" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Ike Irish, RF, Auburn</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 11</strong></p><p>Irish is going to go around here, but I'll admit I'm not sure who the Reds go with here in the event Seth Hernandez and Liam Doyle aren't available.</p><p>Steele Hall, Billy Carlson and Kyson Witherspoon are the other leading options connected here while Josh Hammond is a longer shot and JoJo Parker is connected but also off the board in this scenario.</p><p>Keep an eye on Evan Hankins at a later pick.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/chw.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>10. <a data-clubhouse-guid="8f4800c6-3c05-b3d5-8186-9750cd72a3c2" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox">Chicago White Sox</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Billy Carlson, SS, Corona HS (CA)</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 8</strong></p><p>Carlson is in play to varying degrees at most picks starting around No. 5, with a floor around No. 12 and hot spots from 8 to 10, so this is right around what he should be expecting.</p><p>The White Sox may be the highest on JoJo Parker and his brother Jacob, but I don't think they can get JoJo down to their pick. Steele Hall, Josh Hammond and Gavin Fien are also tied here in a very prep hitter-heavy mix, with prep LHP Kruz Schoolcraft a long shot/later overpay possibility.</p><p>Keep an eye on Gavin Turley and Mason Ligenza at later picks.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/ath.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>11. Athletics</strong></h2><p><strong>Kyson Witherspoon, RHP, Oklahoma</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 10</strong></p><p>Like the Reds, I have some names tied to the A's pick, but this is about the point where the draft is much harder to predict. I think the A's are leaning toward pitching, and Witherspoon's floor is right around here so he represents a nice value.</p><p>I do think this is likely to be a college player, and Brendan Summerhill, Wehiwa Aloy and Gavin Fien (the A's drafted his older brother Dylan last year) have been mentioned here all spring.</p><p>Keep an eye on Jase Mitchell, Micah Bucknam and Tanner Franklin at later picks.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tex.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>12. <a data-clubhouse-guid="4fa2cf46-09fc-255f-74a1-2a8857b0e671" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers">Texas Rangers</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Steele Hall, SS, Hewitt-Trussville HS (AL)</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 13</strong></p><p>I think this is where Billy Carlson definitely stops if he slides.

<strong>Rank: 14</strong></p><p>I think this pick feels like a lefty hitter from the college ranks (like last year's pick James Tibbs). Whether that is Summerhill, this spot being the floor for Ike Irish, and a possible high point for Andrew Fischer or Charles Davalan.</p><p>Keep an eye on Will Rhine and Taitn Gray at later picks.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tb.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>14. <a data-clubhouse-guid="f8a579c6-08b9-7584-141d-317d0645763b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Jaden Fauske, RF, Nazareth Academy HS (IL)</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 31</strong></p><p>The Rays still have two extra picks on top of the allotted three on Day 1, even after <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45710338/orioles-trade-reliever-bryan-baker-rays-draft-pick">trading one away</a> for reliever <a data-player-guid="9b499f37-06a1-d04e-7ff3-0294825e065f" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40884/bryan-baker">Bryan Baker</a> on Thursday. I think their primary targets here are Billy Carlson and Steele Hall, but they both aren't available in this scenario, so the Rays may try another Xavier Isaac gambit: taking a guy they really like who likely won't be available by their next pick and isn't expected to go this high, then banking some savings and spreading it around to other picks.</p><p>I have the Rays tied to a number of prep position players for later picks and it seems like this strategy would land them at least one more of those than they'd get if they played this pick straight, maybe with Josh Hammond or similarly named prospects Gavin Fien or Gavin Kilen, three other players the Rays have interest in.</p><p>Keep an eye on Dean Moss, Matthew Fisher, Taitn Gray, Sean Gamble, Landon Harmon, Brady Ebel and Brisen Tweedy at later picks.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bos.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>15. <a data-clubhouse-guid="c6df06f6-785d-3900-4935-5fd13742e2ee" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox">Boston Red Sox</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Gavin Fien, 3B, Great Oak HS (CA)</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 12</strong></p><p>Fien has a good chance to land here, as long rumored. I think he's underrated due to uneven spring after he was one of the better hitters on the summer circuit.

<strong>Rank: 20</strong></p><p>We're now pretty securely in the realm of making educated guesses based on a team's history and what other teams think they'll do.

<strong>Rank: 15</strong></p><p>After Thursday's trade for another comp pick, giving Baltimore three total, this pick is a little more likely to be a slot-or-below college player as the O's likely collect high school players down the board unless they can float a premium talent to this pick.</p><p>Aloy fits the Orioles' tendencies and is a nice value here. I think they're targeting Jaden Fauske, Dax Kilby, Tate Southisene and Xavier Neyens at those comp picks and then Mason Ligenza, Will Rhine and Ethan Rogers after that.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mil.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>20. <a data-clubhouse-guid="4750d73d-d92e-b390-758c-2c7b44a810db" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Marek Houston, SS, Wake Forest</strong><br>
<strong>Rank: 22</strong></p><p>I have the Brew Crew tied to three shortstops here: Daniel Pierce, Coy James and Houston.

This is about the middle of the ranges for Pierce and Houston.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/hou.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><strong>21. <a data-clubhouse-guid="00a3015f-09ec-1b03-52af-656f5e0a18d5" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros">Houston Astros</a> </strong></h2><p><strong>Jace LaViolette, CF, Texas A&amp;M</strong><br>

<strong>Rank: 19</strong></p><p>I think Detroit takes a high school prospect with at least one if not both of its first two picks, here and No. 34 overall.

<strong>Rank: 25</strong></p><p>This is great value for the Brewers, which is what they do more often than almost any other team.
