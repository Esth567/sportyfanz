He's also a promising switch-hitter with strong bat-to-ball and zone-management skills (though he seems unlikely to get to even average power). As an added bonus, Willits won't celebrate his 18th birthday until December -- studies have shown that such competence at a young age tends to bode well for the player's long-term outlook.&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div>

He then scuffled to begin the season, exiting March with a 4.24 ERA that represented the highest in the Gauchos rotation. Bremner rebounded from there, notching 10 or more strikeouts in six of his final seven starts. (Notably, he had not punched out double digit batters in any appearance prior to April 4.) Scouts attributed Bremner's turnaround to him rediscovering his fastball.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><div>

    </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Kade Anderson, LHP, LSU:</strong> Anderson is a four-pitch lefty who survived an SEC vetting. What more do you need to know? Maybe that he possesses a low-90s fastball, two breaking balls (including a harder slider), and a changeup that generated ample whiffs against right-handed batters. And possibly that he's also shown good control over his pitches, averaging fewer than two walks per appearance. It's a strong year for collegiate lefties at the top of the draft, but Anderson might be the safest of the bunch.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div>

    </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p><strong>Ethan Holliday, 3B/SS, Stillwater HS (OK):</strong> The most famous player in this year's draft. Holliday is the son of a former All-Star and the brother of a future one, placing enormous (and probably unfair) expectations on his own career. Fortunately, he's an intriguing prospect. Holliday is likely to end up at third base before all is said and done, but the real selling point here is and will remain his bat. He's a lefty hitter with a good approach and big-time strength, giving him the kind of on-base and slugging capacity that could entrench him in the middle of an order. Scouts do still have concerns about his contact chops, but they were encouraged by his decision to add a toe tap to his operation this spring and believe he'll work to get the most from his talent.</p></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div>

    </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee</strong>: Doyle was the breakout star of the college baseball season, hanging his star at the onset by striking out 47 batters in his first 20-plus innings. He didn't maintain that pace the rest of the way (how could he?), but he did lead the country in strikeout rate (42.6%). Doyle may find himself under the microscope for a few reasons. Foremost, he rode his mid-90s fastball so hard that his usage rate would've been highest among qualified MLB starting pitchers. Of course, it's hard to knock him for embracing what proved to be a winning strategy, and to his credit he did show enough promise with his other pitches (including a slider and change) that this may prove to be a non-factor.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div>

    </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Seth Hernandez, RHP, Corona HS (CA)</strong>: Hernandez is arguably the most polarizing player in the class because of the clash between the macro and the micro. Empirically, prep right-handers are a terrible bet to make in the early stages of the draft. Is it fair to hold someone else's history against Hernandez? That's where opinions may differ. If you're just weighing him on his own merits, he's a physical, live-armed righty with a good changeup and a feel for spin. You can envision this working, and possibly working out well -- you just have to block out the howls of failures past to do it.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div>

Wood, who missed two starts with a shoulder issue and then posted a 5.33 ERA in 25 innings, is a good example of that dynamic at play. He's went much higher than the statline suggests because of a quality arsenal (including a mid-to-upper-90s fastball and two breaking balls) and a stature and release point combination that creates a very flat plane to the top of the strike zone. If everything clicks -- and nothing tears or breaks -- he could develop into the best pitcher in the class.</p></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div>
