Seattle was the other team taking a long look at Hernandez, but the shenanigans at the top two picks (more on that later) means that both Seattle and Pittsburgh got their preferred arms.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/oak.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>A's select Arnold and Taylor</strong></p><p>The Athletics had only two picks on Day 1 but received excellent values at each. Jamie Arnold was the top prospect in the draft entering the season and seemed primed to go somewhere between No. 2 and No. 8 after an uneven season. He somehow was the prospect left holding the short straw, falling to the 11th pick. Devin Taylor was in the mix at multiple picks in the comp round but lasted five selections into the second round.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/min.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>Twins embrace risk with Quick and Young</strong></p><p>The Twins took two hit-first college infielders as their first picks last year (Kaelen Culpepper and Kyle DeBarge), took another one in the 2023 second round (Luke Keaschall), and two more in the top two rounds in 2022 (Brooks Lee, Tanner Schobel) -- and also took one with their first pick this year in Marek Houston.</p><p>What interested me though is what Minnesota did after that, taking big swings with the upside of Riley Quick (four potential plus pitches but below-average command) and Quentin Young (80-grade power potential with big questions on contact rate).</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/phi.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>Phillies try to jump the reliever trade market?</strong></p><p>Gage Wood has a chance to start long term but can also go straight to the upper minors -- if not the big leagues -- and potentially help the bullpen later this season, like a trade deadline addition. The Phillies' next pick, Cade Obermueller, is another possible starter who also could move quickly as a lefty turning 22 later this month with two knockout pitches in his fastball/slider combo. Odds are good that at least one of them can provide big league value in the next 12 months if Philly wants to utilize them that way.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bos.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>The Red Sox land Witherspoon, Phillips and Eyanson</strong></p><p>The Red Sox are interested in creating more pitching depth and selected a number of interesting arms on Day 1. Kyson Witherspoon had a lot of interest in the top 10, but the Red Sox got him at No. 15.</p><p>He'll need to sharpen his execution a notch and his short arm action is unique, but there's midrotation upside. Marcus Phillips has a chance to start but could also bring another distinctive look as a late-inning arm with four plus pitches from a low slot and a triple-digit fastball. Anthony Eyanson is a different sort, with fringy fastball velocity but standout command along with a slider and splitter that keep hitters off-balance.</p><h2><strong>Five eye-openers</strong></h2><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/wsh.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>Eli Willits at No. 1</strong></p><p>The buzz ahead of the draft was that there were three players in play for the top pick and Willits was my third-ranked player in the class, so the same group is what I would've been considering -- and I love Willits as a player. The bonus will be a factor in evaluating how successful this pick will be viewed -- I'll guess it starts with an eight -- but I think this will be seen as a solid decision, as long as Kade Anderson or Ethan Holliday don't become stars.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>Tyler Bremner at No. 2</strong></p><p>The biggest piece of late buzz I was hearing is that Bremner was in play at No. 3 to the Mariners. I didn't hear his name at all at No. 2 so that made this pick the first shocker in the draft.</p><p>Bremner was considered in this area (on a deal) because he could easily be the best pitcher in this class -- but only if he can develop a better slider, which isn't a small if. The Angels seem to have a thought about how to solve this, and how he progresses will be one of the more followed storylines of this draft.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/det.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>Tigers take Yost and Oliveto</strong></p><p>I like both players, but it's fascinating that these two and the most-rumored prep hitter tied to Detroit that they didn't take (Coy James, who had a tough summer) were all missing strong 2024 summer performances.</p><p>Jordan Yost and Michael Oliveto were the only two prep position players in the first-round mix who weren't in the major national events on the summer circuit, thus creating a lot of uncertainty about how to project them.</p><p>The Tigers are right to assume this could create a potential quick gain in value if Yost and Oliveto can perform early in their pro careers, but I don't remember seeing a team double down on lack of summer exposure in the early rounds.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bal.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>Orioles take two catchers in the first round, and two pitchers in the second</strong></p><p>It's certainly a bit odd that the Orioles took two college catchers with their first two picks after taking another one (Ethan Anderson) in the second round last year. Obviously, teams don't draft for big league need -- the O's already have Adley Rutschman -- and they need at least two catchers at all four full season minor league affiliates, it's just odd to see them invest in this position early multiple times. And after all of the position players they have drafted under Mike Elias, they did sneak in two arms on Day 1 with Joseph Dzierwa (a command-forward lefty) and J.T. Quinn (one of my favorite college relievers with the traits to start in pro ball).</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cle.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>Guardians lean into power</strong></p><p>The Guardians often draft, or sign internationally, hit-first players who are often underpowered, with Steven Kwan a prominent example. They swerved a lot this year, taking Jace LaViolette with their first pick (I compare him to Cody Bellinger or Joey Gallo; he hit .258 this season) and Nolan Schubart (24% strikeout rate, 22% in-zone whiff rate) with their fifth pick on Day 1. Those two have big power and strong pull/lift rates, and LaViolette has the athleticism to play center field, so there's real talent, it's just not usually the type that the Guardians have targeted.</p><hr><h2>Best available for Day 2</h2><p><em>Listed by top 250 draft rankings </em></p><p>43.
