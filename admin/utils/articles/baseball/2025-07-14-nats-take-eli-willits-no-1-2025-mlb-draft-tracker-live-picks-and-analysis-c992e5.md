He reclassified to the 2025 class, so is one of the younger players in the draft, not turning 18 until December, a big plus in analytic draft models. He's a clear shortstop with a good hit tool and contact ability, with his future power outcome the biggest question mark as he turns pro.</p><p><strong>Why the Nationals took him here: </strong>There was a lot of intrigue about which direction the Nationals would go in a draft without a slam-dunk No. 1 pick -- and Washington surprised everyone with this pick. Willits was one of the top players in this draft, but he was behind Ethan Holliday and Kade Anderson as options to go No. 1 overall. He's one of the youngest prospects in this draft -- and that's a very good thing for his potential, considering <a data-player-guid="62868d49-9586-ee9d-19b4-66fb91f26733" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32653/carlos-correa">Carlos Correa</a> and <a data-player-guid="94848feb-9141-9679-d2cd-ae79905d969c" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32129/francisco-lindor">Francisco Lindor</a> were also both 17-year-old shortstops on draft night.</p><p>There's also a chance that taking Willits here could come with some bonus-money savings that sets Washington up for some splashy picks in the coming rounds. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong>Kevin McGonigle, with more speed and defense</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>2. <a data-clubhouse-guid="053868c7-8bff-5edb-3cb6-f5490f33ef99" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels">Los Angeles Angels</a>: Tyler Bremner, RHP, UC Santa Barbara</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 18</p><p><strong>Who is Bremner?</strong> Bremner entered the season alongside Jamie Arnold as the top collegiate pitcher after a strong sophomore season and a summer pitching for USA Baseball's collegiate national team, but he scuffled early on with inconsistent stuff and results. He finished stronger, including a string of double-digit-strikeout games, and he threw strikes, walking just 19 batters in 77â…“ innings with 111 strikeouts. He sits 94-96, touching 98, but his plus changeup might be his best offering while his slider was hit hard and backed up compared to 2024.</p><p><strong>Why the Angels took him here: </strong>Two picks into this draft and teams are already sending a clear message, as Bremner is the second straight curveball: The talent at the top doesn't match that of recent drafts, so Washington and L.A. are likely saving money with their picks with underslot deals. Bremner does fit the Angels' model of drafting college prospects who can move quickly, but ESPN's Kiley McDaniel had Bremner ranked just 18th on his <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45688041/2025-mlb-draft-rankings-top-250-prospects-final-kade-anderson-liam-doyle-ethan-holliday">most recent draft board</a>. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> <a data-player-guid="a6551440-b17b-3fc1-60b7-5dbce0a5bda7" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32640/michael-wacha">Michael Wacha</a> with more upside</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sea.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>3. <a data-clubhouse-guid="56d60582-088f-6848-5180-1fb04440cf87" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners">Seattle Mariners</a>: Kade Anderson, LHP, LSU</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 1</p><p><strong>Who is Anderson? </strong>Winner of the Most Outstanding Player award at the College World Series in leading LSU to the title after allowing one run in 17 innings, including a 1-0 shutout in the finals, Anderson topped Division I with 180 strikeouts, finishing 12-1 with a 3.18 ERA. Anderson had Tommy John surgery in high school, missing his senior season, but he's a polished lefty with a five-pitch repertoire if you include both his fastballs. His fastball carries well in the zone, and he commands it well, so it plays up over its 92-94 mph velocity (hitting 97).</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45735038" data-cerebro-id="686dfae6ea1499368b3987e3" data-title="The traits that helped make Kade Anderson a Mariner" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45735038">play</span><figcaption><p>0:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Kade Anderson a Mariner</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped make Kade Anderson the third overall pick by the Mariners.</p></div></div><p><strong>Why the Mariners took him here: </strong>Seattle really couldn't have asked for a better situation than this.

Like his brother, Ethan is a left-handed hitter, although he's much bigger (6-foot-4 compared to 6-foot) and built more like their dad, thus projects to have similar 30-homer power. He lacks the range to stay at shortstop but should be an above-average defender at third base. There are some concerns about his performance last summer on the showcase circuit and weak competition this spring in high school, but scouts love the swing and power ceiling.</p><p><strong>Why the Rockies took him here:</strong> There was plenty of talk about Holliday being a possibility for the No. 1 pick, so the Rockies have to be happy about getting the player who might have the best chance of developing into a true major league star. His best-case scenario is reaching the majors as a power-hitting, good-fielding third baseman who turns into the Rockies' first franchise player since they traded away a power-hitting, good-fielding third baseman in Nolan Arenado. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> Left-handed-hitting version of <a data-player-guid="2eb5e599-5517-7cf4-8f12-de7e6bd899f3" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33857/matt-chapman">Matt Chapman</a> or <a data-player-guid="1a1ec65f-a81f-8ce9-9f38-7275b93a2474" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez">Eugenio Suarez</a></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/stl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>5. <a data-clubhouse-guid="c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>: Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 6</p><p><strong>Who is Doyle? </strong>One of the three highly rated lefty collegiate pitchers, Doyle went 10-4 with a 3.20 ERA for the Vols, striking out 164 in 95â…” innings, finishing second in Division I in strikeouts and first in K's per nine. After sitting in the low 90s as a sophomore, Doyle sat in the mid-90s, peaking at 100 mph and often just blowing his heater by college hitters. He throws strikes, isn't afraid to pitch inside and backs up the fastball with a splitter and slider, pitches he'll probably have to deploy more often as a pro.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45735080" data-cerebro-id="686dca3dd5fb3860ccc891a4" data-title="The traits that helped make Liam Doyle a member of the Cardinals" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45735080">play</span><figcaption><p>0:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Liam Doyle a member of the Cardinals</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped make Liam Doyle the fifth overall pick by the Cardinals.</p></div></div><p><strong>Why the Cardinals took him here: </strong>Doyle's fastball could play in the majors right now, and the Cardinals have long been in need of some hard-throwing additions to their system. The question here is if the rest of Doyle's arsenal and delivery can be strong enough to keep him in the rotation. Best case, St. Louis just added a strong part of its rotation for years to come -- but a potential closer or top setup option isn't a bad fallback plan either. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> <a data-player-guid="fe783a66-6c4d-3706-afae-cc30e5651f97" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4307825/spencer-strider">Spencer Strider</a>, if he was left-handed but had real questions about his command/stamina/delivery</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/pit.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>6. <a data-clubhouse-guid="5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>: Seth Hernandez, RHP, Corona HS (Calif.)</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 4</p><p><strong>Who is Hernandez? </strong>No high school right-hander has ever gone first overall, but Hernandez put himself in that discussion as the clear top prep arm in the draft. With a projectable 6-4 frame, he followed up a strong summer in 2024 with a dominant high school season, touching triple digits but also showcasing a plus-plus changeup and an above-average 12-to-6 curveball with a high spin rate. He was athletic enough to play the field when he didn't pitch, which might help him overcome the risky history of first-round high school pitchers.</p><p><strong>Why the Pirates took him here: </strong>The Pirates have Paul Skenes in the majors and Bubba Chandler, perhaps the top pitching prospect in the minors, in Triple-A, and now they've added Hernandez, who might have the most upside of any pitcher in the draft, with a fastball up to 100 mph and plus-plus changeup. He's a good athlete (he was a second-round prospect as a hitter), which is another plus. The only negative is the scary history of first-round high school pitching prospects, but Hernandez might be the best prep right-handed prospect in a decade. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong><a data-player-guid="fc1345d7-f487-a73d-b74a-5c781b21d2d1" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39910/zac-gallen">Zac Gallen</a> with more stuff or <a data-player-guid="4a17f08f-b20a-2d81-ae0c-ec06266eb20e" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33224/devin-williams">Devin Williams</a> as a starter</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mia.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>7. <a data-clubhouse-guid="74909d10-eacb-1376-ef1e-d0f37d7c67ca" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins">Miami Marlins</a>: Aiva Arquette, SS, Oregon State</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 9</p><p><strong>Who is Arquette? </strong>The latest in the Oregon State pipeline that has produced first-round picks <a data-player-guid="6c414a08-2165-0c57-8a0c-093886b3be8b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41170/nick-madrigal">Nick Madrigal</a>, <a data-player-guid="3b60625b-9789-1a06-612f-dc3c588db16b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41205/trevor-larnach">Trevor Larnach</a>, <a data-player-guid="ef72b3ad-2cb6-eecb-37ab-24726859d3c5" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42178/adley-rutschman">Adley Rutschman</a>, Cooper Hjerpe and Travis Bazzana since 2018, Arquette is a Honolulu native who transferred from Washington and hit .354 with 19 home runs for the Beavers. Viewed as the best college position player, Arquette is 6-foot-5, leading many scouts to think he'll eventually move to third base even though he's agile enough for now to get a shot at shortstop.</p><p><strong>Why the Marlins took him here:</strong> It's no secret that the Marlins are in need of some offensive thump throughout their system. In Arquette, they get one of the top hitters in college baseball and a prospect who should be able to supply some power while climbing quickly to the majors. It's hard to picture the 6-5, 220-pound Oregon State star sticking at shortstop for the long term, but he should have a home somewhere in Miami's infield. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong>Somewhere on the <a data-player-guid="5b0dc2c1-e790-cc40-0add-4ce6867ac25b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33675/willy-adames">Willy Adames</a> to <a data-player-guid="519a39a3-6af2-5f0a-91b9-06a5424ed036" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39706/isaac-paredes">Isaac Paredes</a> spectrum</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tor.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>8. <a data-clubhouse-guid="0151aed9-9f11-ceae-195d-180ca603b64a" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a>: JoJo Parker, SS, Purvis HS (Miss.)</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 7</p><p><strong>Who is Parker? </strong>Viewed as one of the most polished prep hitters in the draft, Parker was the Gatorade Mississippi Player of the Year (his twin brother, Jacob, is also a top prospect) and follows Konnor Griffin, taken ninth last year by the Pirates, as a Mississippi high schooler to go high in the draft. A left-handed batter, Parker has great hand-eye coordination and rarely swings and misses at anything in the zone. He has 20-homer potential, although he'll be tested to stick at shortstop long term.</p><p><strong>Why the Blue Jays took him here: </strong>One of the many prep shortstops in a deep group, Parker's carrying tools are an outstanding bat to go with outstanding makeup.

The big question, though, is if his free-swinging style will work at the next level. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong><a data-player-guid="948a03e2-0df4-d2e2-c11d-dbcd7d7b57b8" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner">Trea Turner</a> with a dash of Jett Williams and a dusting of <a data-player-guid="9a98f8e9-c371-32a1-ac9d-040b12582b8d" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42547/anthony-volpe">Anthony Volpe</a></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cws.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>10. <a data-clubhouse-guid="8f4800c6-3c05-b3d5-8186-9750cd72a3c2" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox">Chicago White Sox</a>: Billy Carlson, SS, Corona HS (Calif.)</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 8</p><p><strong>Who is Carlson? </strong>Seth Hernandez's high school teammate, Carlson is how you draw up a prep shortstop: above-average-to-plus bat speed and raw power, an 80-grade arm (up to 97 mph as a pitcher), range in the field and game performance.

Southisene certainly has some development ahead of him and maybe even ends up in the outfield, but he immediately becomes perhaps the top position player prospect in Atlanta's system. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/kc.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>23. <a data-clubhouse-guid="11a5df00-0945-35a5-66fe-a3a107975558" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-royals">Kansas City Royals</a>: Sean Gamble, 2B, IMG Academy HS (Fla.)</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking:</strong> No. 35</p><p><strong>Who is Gamble? </strong>An Iowa native, Gamble played all four of his high school years at IMG Academy, where he has performed well against good competition on the showcase circuit, with plus bat speed from the left side and plus speed that might eventually see him land in center field, where he has seen action.

If the Royals think that he can stick in center field, the upside of this pick suddenly becomes a lot higher. Offensively, Gamble has a smooth left-handed swing and can drive the ball to all fields.

Yes, his track record in college is limited, but the two-pitch mix is elite.

He makes quality swing decisions and has a quick bat, but swings and misses a lot in the zone.</p><p><strong>Why the Guardians took him here: </strong>This is a very un-Guardians-like pick, but Cleveland has also been in desperate need of power-hitting outfielders and that is exactly what LaViolette is -- as long as he can make enough contact to get to his tremendous power. The Guardians are getting a player at No. 27 who was in the conversation to go about 26 spots earlier than this before the college baseball season began.

He sits in the mid-90s but has been up to triple digits, getting swing and miss with explosive life at the top of the zone.
