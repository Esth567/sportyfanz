<hr><h2> ‚≠ê Good morning to all but especially to ‚Ä¶ </h2><p><strong>KYLE SCHWARBER AND THE NATIONAL LEAGUE ALL-STARS</strong> </p><p>The National League made MLB All-Star Game history when it <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/2025-mlb-all-star-game-score-national-league-wins-on-wild-home-run-derby-style-swing-off-tiebreaker/live/">pulled off a wild victory</a> in the event's first Home Run Derby-style tiebreaker. And it was <strong>Kyle Schwarber</strong> that delivered the NL's greatest heroics in the swing-off. He drilled all three of his swings over the fence to put his squad in front for good, and in turn, he hauled in the MVP honor after what was an otherwise quiet, 0-for-2 night at the dish. </p><ul><li>Schwarber is the first non-pitcher in MLB history to win the All-Star Game MVP award without posting a hit.</li><li>The <strong>Phillies</strong> claimed their second All-Star Game MVP in franchise history and first since <strong>Johnny Callison</strong> in 1964.</li></ul><p>Schwarber's NL All-Stars led by as many as six runs before the American League stormed back with a four-run seventh inning and two runs in the top of the ninth. <strong>Steven Kwan</strong> legged out an infield RBI single to knot things up at six and invoke the swing-off rule that MLB instituted in 2022. </p><p><strong>Pete Alonso</strong> and <strong>Corbin Carroll</strong> also shined for the NL with a home run apiece, and the former's drove in three runs to, at the time, break things open. On the mound, <strong>Paul Skenes</strong> looked like his usual outstanding self with a dazzling start, fanning a pair of batters in a perfect first inning before giving way to a 12-man committee of relievers. Only<strong> Carlos Est√©vez</strong> (three) had more strikeouts than the <strong>Pirates</strong> ace. </p>

But as he nears training camp in the final year of his current contract, talks between the sides are at a standstill. McLaurin said the Commanders have not spoken to his camp in over a month, and he is <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commanders-terry-mclaurin-disappointed-and-frustrated-with-contract-situation-as-training-camp-nears/">"pretty frustrated" with the situation</a>. </p><p>"Everything that has transpired up to this point has been disappointing and frustrating," he said. "I want to continue my career here, I've created my life here, my wife and I have bought our first home here. So this has been somewhere where I've always wanted to be. Just to see how things have played out has been disappointing." </p><p>Given that McLaurin is such an integral piece of one of the NFL's most explosive and exciting young offenses, Washington figures to benefit greatly from locking him up on a long-term deal. But in the event that the Commanders would rather move him than give him a raise, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/terry-mclaurin-landing-spots-potential-trade-suitors-as-wr-frustrated-with-commanders-amid-contract-dispute/">Cody Benjamin says</a> these four teams -- <strong>Chargers</strong>, <strong>Colts</strong>, <strong>Jets</strong> and <strong>Raiders</strong> -- should give general manager Adam Peters a call. </p>
        

<p>The $23.3 million McLaurin makes on an annual basis ranks outside the top 15 at the wide receiver position. The <strong>Ohio State</strong> product brought heaps of value to the franchise last season when he ranked second in the NFL with 13 receiving touchdowns. </p><h3> üëé Not so honorable mentions </h3><ul><li><strong>Caitlin Clark</strong> <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/caitlin-clark-injury-fever-star-appears-to-injure-right-groin-late-in-win-over-sun-will-be-evaluated/">appeared to injure her groin</a>&nbsp;on Tuesday, putting her availability for All-Star weekend in question.</li><li><strong>Rhyne Howard</strong> is out of Saturday's WNBA All-Star Game with a knee injury, and <strong>Kayla McBride</strong> <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/2025-wnba-all-star-game-lynxs-kayla-mcbride-named-as-replacement-for-injured-dream-guard-rhyne-howard/">is in as her replacement</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/back-to-school-back-to-the-draft-shemar-stewart-could-exploit-loophole-in-chaotic-rulebook-to-burn-bengals/">There is a real chance</a> that first-round pick <strong>Shemar Stewart</strong> fails to sign with the <strong>Bengals</strong> and returns to <strong>Texas A&amp;M</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dereck Lively II</strong> <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/mavs-center-dereck-lively-ii-has-surgery-to-clean-up-bone-spurs-in-his-foot-expected-back-by-training-camp/">had surgery</a> to clean up the bone spurs in his foot that cost him half of the 2024-25 NBA season.</li><li>The Pac-12 and Mountain West <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/pac-12-mountain-west-heading-to-court-after-failed-mediation-over-exit-fees-poaching-penalties/">are headed to court</a> after they failed to settle over exit fees and poaching penalties.</li><li>Former MLB pitcher <strong>Dan Serafini</strong> <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/former-mlb-pitcher-convicted-of-first-degree-murder-in-2021-shooting-of-wifes-parents/">was convicted</a> on multiple charges, including first-degree murder.</li><li><strong>Tulsa</strong> co-offensive coordinator <strong>Ty Darlington</strong> <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ty-darlington-tulsa-co-offensive-coordinator-arrested-on-suspicion-of-dui/">was arrested</a> on suspicion of DUI.</li><li>The long wait for <strong>Al Horford</strong> to make a decision on his next team, or retirement, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-rumors-al-horford-reportedly-receiving-interest-from-four-teams-not-in-any-hurry-to-make-decision/">continues</a>.</li><li>Not all MLB players <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/does-mlb-need-to-fix-all-star-game-selection-process-rules-players-are-split-on-who-gets-to-go/">agree with</a> the All-Star Game selection process.</li><li><strong>Bill Goldberg</strong> <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/goldberg-expresses-frustration-with-wwes-handling-of-final-match-farewell-speech-you-dont-do-that/">was not thrilled</a> with how WWE handled the buildup and execution of his final pro wrestling appearance.</li></ul><h2> üí∞ Sauce Gardner, Trey Smith get paid </h2><figure><p><img alt="sauce-gardner.jpg" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/15/9e397f77-878f-422c-8778-d3f00a54ca6c/resize/670x377/5b357846fe1878f10a7ec093d145ce15/sauce-gardner.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>

Gardner reset the cornerback market with a four-year, $120.4 million extension that averages $30.1 million annually, includes $60 million guaranteed and makes him the highest-paid cornerback in NFL history. The extension came one day after the Jets signed wide receiver <strong>Garrett Wilson</strong> to a four-year, $130 million deal. </p><p>The <strong>Chiefs</strong> <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chiefs-make-trey-smith-highest-paid-offensive-guard-in-nfl-with-four-year-94-million-extension/">were also big spenders</a> Tuesday with their four-year, $94 million agreement with <strong>Trey Smith</strong>.

<ul><li><strong><strong>McDonald:</strong> </strong><em>"</em><strong><strong><em>Tyrrell Hatton</em></strong><em> </em></strong><em>(33-1) was the preseason pick, and we are not wavering in our belief. Hatton had his chance at the U.S. Open before a bogey-bogey finish to wind up T4 at Oakmont. He has since added a quality outing on LIV Golf. His links golf r√©sum√© is stellar with three wins in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and a couple of solid runs in this championship, including a T6 in 2019 at Royal Portrush."</em></li><li><strong><strong>Kalland:</strong> </strong><em>"</em><strong><strong><em>Jon Rahm</em></strong></strong><em> (12-1) is in really good form right now. He's even starting to look like his old self again at the majors. He finished second last week at LIV Golf Andaluc√≠a in his tune-up event in Spain and has back-to-back top 10s at the PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Now he heads to The Open where he's been terrific in recent years with three top 10s in the last four years (including a runner-up and a T3), and this week will be his time to add a Claret Jug to his collection."</em></li></ul><h2> üèà NFL All-Quarter Century Team </h2><figure><p><img alt="Super Bowl LV" src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/16/410cfd49-d395-45d9-865e-bdc72812ddfd/resize/670x377/e304bdcddeb798676a44cd880d89587f/gettyimages-1300896025-1.jpg" loading="lazy" height="377" width="670"></p><figcaption><span>
