        <p>One of the wildest All-Star Games in baseball history ended in a tiebreaker home run derby Tuesday night at Truist Park. After the American League came back from a 6-0 deficit, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135243/kyle-schwarber/">Kyle Schwarber</a> led the National League to a 4-3 in the tiebreaker swing-off, earning him All-Star Game MVP honors. Officially, the final score is 6-6 (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/boxscore/MLB_20250715_ALA@NLA/" target="_blank">box score</a>), with the NL winning in a tiebreaker. </p><p>Schwarber went 3 for 3 in the swing-off to turn a 3-1 deficit into a 4-3 win for the National League. Here are his home run swings: </p>
<p>This was the first swing-off tiebreaker in All-Star Game history. The rule was implemented in 2022 as a way to save pitchers, but had not been needed until Tuesday. In the swing-off, each team picks three hitters, who then take three swings each. The most homers wins.</p><p>"Schwarbs, if he touches it, it's 110," National League manager Dave Roberts said after the game. "Like I said earlier, he doesn't take much batting practice outside anymore. For him to get out there and see an arm he's never seen before in (tiebreaker pitcher Dino Ebel), use a big part of the field and hit it out and clutch up and hit three homers. The last one bought in a little bit, kept it fair. That speaks to the hitter he is. You've got a guy who can really hit with bat to ball and has huge power. It's fun to watch."</p>
        

<p>Schwarber, in his third All-Star Game, became only the second All-Star Game MVP in <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/">Phillies</a> history. Outfielder Johnny Callison hit a walk-off three-run home run to win MVP honors in the 1964 All-Star Game at Shea Stadium. Schwarber went 0 for 2 with a walk before the tiebreaker, making him the first non-pitcher to win All-Star Game MVP without getting a hit in the actual game.</p><p>The 32-year-old slugger took a .247/.378/.545 batting line and 30 home runs into the All-Star break for the first-place Phillies. Only <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/">Cal Raleigh</a> (38), <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/">Aaron Judge</a> (35), <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2901324/shohei-ohtani/">Shohei Ohtani</a> (32), and <span>Eugenio Su√°rez</span> (31) have more homers than Schwarber. </p>
        

<p>Tuesday's win was only the second in the last 12 All-Star Games for the National League. </p>
