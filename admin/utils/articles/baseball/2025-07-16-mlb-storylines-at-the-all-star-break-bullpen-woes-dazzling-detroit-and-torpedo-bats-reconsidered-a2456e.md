So, how did it go? Here’s a handful of storylines to chew on as we prepare for the second-half stretch run.</p><h2 id="what-hasnt-happened">What hasn’t happened</h2><p>Remember the torpedo bats that were a destroyer of worlds in the season’s opening days? Some geniuses even said they were the latest example of how “over-innovation can ruin baseball” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/01/new-york-yankees-torpedo-bats" data-link-name="in body link">(no idea who wrote that zinger)</a>. Well, so far that’s looking like <em>the</em> kneejerk reaction of the season, or maybe several seasons. The Yankees, who are the chief adapters of the redesigned bats that boast customized sweet spots, hit 15 home runs in three games against Milwaukee at the start of the season. Then they calmed down and struck 1.46 home runs per game from then on. Yes, they still lead the league in homers, and yes, they’re averaging more dingers per game than they did last year when Juan Soto was in their lineup. But the tech has <em>not</em> in fact made a complete farce of the game. Has Cal Raleigh, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/01/cal-raleigh-big-dumper-seattle-mariners-mvp-case" data-link-name="in body link">the Mariners’ torpedo bat swinging MVP candidate</a>, been aided by the innovation? Well, he has 38 homers this season, four more than his career-high already, while Triple Crown candidate Aaron Judge, who doesn’t use a torpedo bat, has 35. This time, let’s go with a more conservative take on the bats: the jury’s still out.</p><figure id="a24ff254-85e7-4289-b484-b4d426cfe0fd" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Cal Raleigh’s wild, breakout season continued with a win at the Home Run Derby in Atlanta on Monday." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.699124726477" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Cal Raleigh’s wild, breakout season continued with a win at the Home Run Derby in Atlanta on Monday.</span> Photograph: Mike Stewart/AP</figcaption></figure><h2 id="oh-the-bullpens">Oh, the bullpens …</h2><p>What drives fans the most crazy? The way their manager handles his bullpen. Don’t believe me? Try searching “bullpen management” on X and see what comes up; it’s not pretty. But here’s the thing: when your starting pitchers average well under six innings a game, and you have to figure out how to get an additional nine, 12, 15 outs or more, where’s the roadmap for that? There isn’t one – managers make it up on the fly most nights. With a bevy of starters recovering from elbow injuries, while upper management continues to nurse the long men, desperate brass are forced to shuttle relievers between the minors and the majors looking for fresh arms. It’s pretty ugly. Is anyone getting it “right?” Well, few outside LA are going to sympathize with the super-rich Dodgers, but their skipper Dave Roberts is getting just <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2025-starter-pitching.shtml" data-link-name="in body link">4.5 innings a game</a> from his beleaguered, injury riddled starters, the worst number in all of baseball (<a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2025-starter-pitching.shtml" data-link-name="in body link">the MLB average is 5.2</a>). Apparently there’s more than a few teams that’ll be looking for bullpen help at the 31 July trade deadline. Yeah, you think?</p><h2 id="stand-up-for-detroit">Stand up for Detroit</h2><p>Remember last July when the Tigers were dealing away players, and then somehow made the playoffs and came within a single victory of the American League Championship Series? Well, as it turns out, that run was no fluke. The Tigers have an 11.5 game lead in the AL Central at the break, the largest such lead they’ve had since the All-Star Game began in 1933. For context, the historic 1984 Tigers that began 35-5 had an eight-game lead at the break. Detroit own the best record in all of baseball, even after losing their last four games.</p><figure id="cee5a0ef-fb09-4177-8068-cf601b6858c2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="When it comes to time for Tarik Skubal to pitch, just wind him up and let him go.

Tarik Skubal has stiff competition from Boston’s Garrett Crochet in his bid to win a second successive Cy Young, but the Tigers hurler has walked just 16 batters in 121 innings – an astonishingly low number. Meanwhile, Detroit’s lineup is full of redemption songs, with three players in the top five favored for the AL Comeback Player of the Year award (Rangers ace Jacob deGrom leads that group). Former No 1 overall pick Spencer Torkelson has recovered from an abysmal 2024 to power up a Tigers offense driven by Gleyber Torres, Riley Greene and Zach McKinstry, allowing the bats to overshadow a middle-of-the road pitching staff, Skubal aside. But perhaps the story of the season is Javier Baez. The once big-dollar-bust is an All-Star this season, and has upped his OPS by more than 230 points from last season and is Detroit’s face of mojo as they head to the second half of the season.</p><h2 id="the-lost-boys">The Lost Boys</h2><p>The Colorado Rockies weren’t daunted by the 2024 White Sox’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/27/the-2024-chicago-white-sox-a-team-so-historically-bad-they-stopped-tweeting-results" data-link-name="in body link">modern MLB record</a> for losses in a season.

Clearly a salary cap, which every other major North American sports league has in some form or other, could help with such imbalance. But with a divide between rich and richer owners and a players’ union that’s fought against a cap for its entire existence, that will always be a tough sell, and so the issue will be a source of labor strife after the 2026 season.</p><p>And speaking of a tough sell, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mlb" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">MLB</a> has been trying to unload a short-term package of games since ESPN opted out of the final three years of their rights deal worth roughly $1.5bn.

They lead the Brewers in the NL Central by a single game. In the NL East, the Phillies have power issues, but it’s Zach Wheeler and their starting pitching that’s given them a short lead over the Mets, who started fast and fell faster, losing 17 of 27 games heading into the break. In the AL East, the Yankees slumped themselves out of first place, while the surprising Blue Jays overtook the Bombers despite an inferior run difference. The once hotter than hot Rays traded places with the Red Sox who rode a 10-game winning streak into third place at the break, all after controversially trading away Rafael Devers and losing Alex Bregman to injury. The Houston Astros of the AL West dealt away their best player, Tucker, in the offseason, but look better without him: hurlers Framber Valdez, Hunter Brown and a white hot pen have the ‘Stros in a commanding first place position after an un-Astro-like 2024. In the NL West, the “Best Team Ever” are yet to play like it, but then again, LA have been missing most of their rotation for most of the season.</p><figure id="f26e7429-177c-4a9e-a57b-fed2f9366325" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="What doesn’t Shohei Ohtani do?" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>What doesn’t Shohei Ohtani do?</span> Photograph: Godofredo A Vásquez/AP</figcaption></figure><p>The Dodgers are likely to get stronger when it matters though. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/shohei-ohtani" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Shohei Ohtani</a> is pitching again and has an ERA just over one as he stretches out for the postseason, Tyler Glasnow just returned, with Blake Snell and Roki Sasaki to follow.
