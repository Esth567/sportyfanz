Raleigh drew fairly close in late June, but the gap has since widened again. That's not Raleigh's fault; it's just Judge being Judge. At the time of our last Awards Watch, Judge had a 1.234 OPS. Since then, he has managed a meager 1.141. Yeah, that's still pretty good.</p><p>The shape of Judge's numbers has changed a bit. <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45253929/2025-mlb-awards-watch-memorial-day-mvp-cy-young-judge-ohtani">When we convened in late May</a>, he was hitting .395, and he has posted a mortal .297 average since. But he has picked things up in the slugging category. Last time, he was mashing homers at the rate of 54 per 162 games. Since, that number is 66. Raleigh might be having the greatest catcher season of all time, and it's possible that if there is any kind of Judge fatigue among the voters, that could impact the ballot. But what isn't likely is any kind of prolonged drop-off by Judge.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> Buxton wasn't in the top 10 last time out, but he has entered the top five based on several weeks of elite production and good health. During an 11-year career marked as much by injury as spectacular play, the first half featured Buxton at his best and most available, putting him on pace for his first 30/30 season at age 31. It keeps getting better: Since the last Awards Watch, Buxton has a 1.025 OPS with rates of 48 homers and 39 steals per 162 games.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Last time, there were two Red Sox in the top 10. Both have dropped out, with <a data-player-guid="b28542aa-30be-6851-75c4-501226976e1c" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34886/alex-bregman">Alex Bregman</a> hitting the IL and <a data-player-guid="9a29840a-6ec6-8b17-995a-f01bc7567f2d" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33859/rafael-devers">Rafael Devers</a> hitting the airport for a flight to join his new team in San Francisco. But Boston is still represented by the overlooked Rafaela. No, he isn't going to overtake Judge in the MVP race, but one of baseball's most unique players deserves a little run.</p><p>After splitting time between shortstop and center field in 2024, Rafaela has played almost exclusively on the grass this season, and his defensive metrics have been off the charts. That's driving this ranking, but Rafaela also has made tremendous strides at the plate. After entering the season with a career OPS+ of 83, he has upped that number to 118 in 2025 and is on pace for a 20/20 campaign.</p><hr><p><strong>National League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid="04a76996-4a5c-456d-8022-a9d45e3ff933" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani">Shohei Ohtani</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> (144 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2. <a data-player-guid="dcbeba5a-3fe9-3bf0-9f19-c077ef2a6f78" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4717833/pete-crow-armstrong">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> (143); 3. <a data-player-guid="e2da449e-fe21-39e0-bd60-5b548dc4108b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35983/fernando-tatis-jr">Fernando Tatis Jr.</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres">San Diego Padres</a> (136); 4. <a data-player-guid="b963b85d-6db2-f0e5-b763-88d4a41c0d73" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34967/kyle-tucker">Kyle Tucker</a>, Cubs (135); 5. <a data-player-guid="05e514e4-4e08-31e8-a7bc-7aa82497d299" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4918256/james-wood">James Wood</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals">Washington Nationals</a> (134); 6. <a data-player-guid="7e560f9f-b486-f5f1-20a4-7699c1338287" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38309/will-smith">Will Smith</a>, Dodgers (131); 7.

He has lurked behind Ohtani on the AXE leaderboard for most of the season, but a quiet series from Ohtani in Milwaukee paired with another outburst from Crow-Armstrong flipped the top spot. Ohtani is still the favorite -- the leaderboard flipped again over the weekend and, besides, he's Ohtani -- but at this point, we have to come to grips with the reality that Crow-Armstrong can mount a legitimate challenge.</p><p>Like Rafaela, Crow-Armstrong's defensive metrics are top of the charts and, in fact, those two are in a duel for the MLB lead in defensive runs saved metrics among outfielders. But Crow-Armstrong's bat continues to fuel his rise to superstar status. He entered the break on pace for 42 homers and 46 steals.</p><p>Ironically, if the offensive numbers between Ohtani and Crow-Armstrong are tight, it could come down to very different forms of run prevention. Crow-Armstrong is at 15 defensive runs saved as a center fielder. Meanwhile, Ohtani is at three runs above average during his nine innings on the mound. As the pitching side of Ohtani's record grows, that gap might narrow considerably.</p><p>If that happens and it comes down to a straight-up comparison at the plate, it's going to be tough for Crow-Armstrong, whose 140 OPS+ currently is dwarfed by Ohtani's 174.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> Wood continues to cement his arrival as a right-now star player, and his pace has been accelerating even after an excellent start. Despite a subdued week before the break, Wood has a .908 OPS and 162-game rates of 42 homers, 127 RBIs, 19 steals and 100 runs since the last Awards Watch. Overall, he has a .381 OBP and is on pace for 100 walks, so those numbers aren't driven by a short-term power surge. At 22, Wood simply is already an all-around offensive force.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Tucker overtook Crow-Armstrong for the No. 2 slot (and the Cubs' team lead) in AXE late in June, before Crow-Armstrong reasserted himself. But Tucker's production is metronomic: His AXE at the last Awards Watch was 130, and he is now at 135. Tucker has an .839 OPS at Wrigley Field as compared to .905 on the road, where 12 of his 17 homers have been hit. But if warmer weather and outward-blowing winds become consistent in Chicago, a Tucker power surge could be in the offing. If that happens, look out.</p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png" width="100%"></p><h2>Cy Young</h2><p><strong>American League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid="2e709af2-d8bb-3d70-978d-f33a50695c14" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42409/tarik-skubal">Tarik Skubal</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="b27c64bf-4f18-f713-ba06-db1bce2394e7" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/det/detroit-tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> (151 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine: </strong>2. <a data-player-guid="758d4fc6-a046-3dc0-9280-c6279357128c" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4297835/garrett-crochet">Garrett Crochet</a>, Red Sox (149); 3.

A few more weeks have brought AXE in line with reality, as Skubal has gone to that magical place few pitchers ever reach.</p><p>Skubal's blastoff actually began when we posted the last Awards Watch, as he was coming off a complete-game, two-hit shutout against Cleveland. Perhaps the most impressive part of that outing is that he recorded 13 strikeouts on just 94 pitches. Well, since then, Skubal did the same thing to Minnesota: 13 whiffs on 93 pitches on June 29.</p><p>In eight outings following the last Watch, Skubal has gone 5-1 with a 1.89 ERA, thrown at least seven innings five times and posted an absurd ratio of 61 strikeouts to nine walks. This race isn't over, but it's clearly Skubal's to win.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> DeGrom missed the top 10 last time, but since then, he has shown every indication of ramping back up to his historic level of stifling run prevention. He's doing it a little differently than he did in his Mets heyday, emphasizing pitch efficiency to a greater extent.</p><p>DeGrom's 26% strikeout rate is his lowest in nearly a decade, and he has reached double digits in whiffs just once this season. But he has a sparkling 2.32 ERA and has been at 2.20 over eight starts since the last Awards Watch. He had a string of five straight starts when he threw at least six innings, reaching seven twice, all without hitting the 90-pitch mark.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Crochet has been coming on like gangbusters, as has the team around him. He finished his first half with a complete-game, three-hit shutout of Tampa Bay, closing the AXE gap between him and Skubal. Crochet leads the AL in innings pitched (129⅓), strikeouts (160) and ERA+ (185).

Recently, I re-pitched the notion of <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45575126/2025-mlb-pitcher-wins-paul-skenes-new-formula-game-scores-analytics">a revised win-loss record based on game scores</a>, so that's worth taking a fresh look at to see if the difference in the traditional records is misleading.</p><p>Well, it is and it isn't. Skenes has suffered a string of hard-luck game score losses of late and now sits at 11-9 by that method. Wheeler, meanwhile, is an MLB-best 16-3. Wheeler also has a solid edge in average game score at 65.2, as compared to 63.2 for Skenes. For now, Wheeler has the edge.</p><p>Will it last? Consider another byproduct of that game score work: pitcher temperature. You win a game score matchup, the temp goes up. You lose, it goes down. Each starter begins his career at the average temperature of 72 degrees, and it goes back and forth from there. The hottest starter in baseball by this method: Wheeler, at 127.2 degrees. Because of his recent bad run, Skenes has cooled to 68.7 degrees.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> For now, Sanchez has seized the spot just behind Wheeler, which of course makes him a mere No. 2 in his own rotation. Sanchez was overlooked when the NL All-Star rosters were released, and it was a true oversight. Like Wheeler, Sanchez has been fiery hot, with a string of excellent outings since the last Awards Watch. Over nine starts during that span, Sanchez has 1.77 ERA and 2.11 FIP, while pitching seven innings or more six times.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Let's just stick with our Phillies theme and keep our eyes on their whole rotation. Wheeler (second), Sanchez (third) and Suarez (sixth) are entrenched in the top 10. Meanwhile, <a data-player-guid="31b52969-26e1-6862-3e22-cb52673d5fd4" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39667/jesus-luzardo">Jesus Luzardo</a> (126 AXE), who led this category last time out, just missed giving the Phillies four rotation members in the top 10. Philadelphia leads the majors in average game score and is second in the NL (behind Cincinnati) in game score win-loss percentage.</p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png" width="100%"></p><h2>Rookie of the Year</h2><p><strong>American League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid="e2195f6a-a0a0-a5fc-2c5c-ead7e3ebd05a" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719300/jacob-wilson">Jacob Wilson</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="1d8ed3a9-4c7d-0941-3677-bb6defe67c7a" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ath/athletics-athletics">Athletics</a> (121 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2. <a data-player-guid="ec3efeaa-14f5-3935-be93-805a36276ce2" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5012120/carlos-narvaez">Carlos Narvaez</a>, Red Sox (120); 3. <a data-player-guid="eb3c83c3-4277-3fcc-bc07-dbd57f7253df" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080766/cam-smith">Cam Smith</a>, Astros (116); 4. <a data-player-guid="9f2297a0-32f0-3c3e-abe9-537942d36f4b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4417208/noah-cameron">Noah Cameron</a>, Royals (115); 5. <a data-player-guid="3c91bc94-f039-3293-8b62-e6371ebaea0b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4966637/nick-kurtz">Nick Kurtz</a>, Athletics (108); 6. <a data-player-guid="dff39eef-0f97-3e78-879b-6536b1ecf37d" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42664/jake-mangum">Jake Mangum</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="f8a579c6-08b9-7584-141d-317d0645763b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a> (107); 7.

He was hitting .348 at the last Awards Watch then went out and pushed that number to .372 on June 8. Since then, Wilson has hit just .222 and has just three extra-base hits over 24 games. Wilson's quick beginning turned enough heads to get him voted as the AL's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game. But he has been replaced by Smith as the AL Rookie of the Year favorite at ESPN BET.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> Smith has mashed his way into prominence, but he's proving to be a well-rounded young hitter despite just 32 games of minor league experience. Alas, his surprising .277 batting average is driven by a .378 BABIP that doesn't seem likely to hold up. However, Smith has just seven homers, and if his game power starts to match his raw power, he can easily replace any loss in average with a gain in slugging.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Kurtz has been picking up the pace, especially in the power category, manifesting what was his calling card prior to reaching the majors. Kurtz hit the IL with a hip injury on the day the last Awards Watch went out. He had just started to drive the ball before getting hurt, and he has gone right on slugging since he came back. After homering just once over his first 23 games, Kurtz has since gone deep 16 times in 35 contests while slugging .713 in the process.</p><hr><p><strong>National League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid="dffe573b-a9b5-3fdc-8932-fa202585a91b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5007615/caleb-durbin">Caleb Durbin</a>, Brewers (113 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2.
