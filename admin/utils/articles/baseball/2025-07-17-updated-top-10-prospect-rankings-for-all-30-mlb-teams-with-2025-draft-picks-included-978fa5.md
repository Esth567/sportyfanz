The Braves posture at the deadline will be fascinating to monitor.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mia.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="74909d10-eacb-1376-ef1e-d0f37d7c67ca" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins">Miami Marlins</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> <a data-player-guid="c0983079-e22f-3b2c-b220-2e8de6f4b1a1" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5132014/agustin-ramirez">Agustin Ramirez</a> and <a data-player-guid="454149fa-78f6-3863-a2fd-836175dd78eb" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4622931/graham-pauley">Graham Pauley</a> graduated this year. Kemp Alderman was the last cut and 2025 draft picks Brandon Compton, Max Williams and Drew Faurot fit within the top 20 to 25.</p><p>The Marlins have really accumulated a lot of depth throughout the system with a focus on position players, even if there isn't a clear star hitter in this group. If play development progress continues, there could be the core of a playoff team in a year or two.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nym.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets">New York Mets</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> Because of a depth of quality prospects in the system, Mitch Voit isn't in the top 15 after being the Mets' first 2025 draft pick. Jacob Reimer, Jonathan Santucci and Elian Pena are among those who just missed this list that would make the top 10 for many teams.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/phi.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> You'd have to believe the Phillies will be adding at the deadline again and any players in this top six could be major parts of a real trade package. Wood can't be traded before the deadline and the players below him have value that will vary from team to team.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/wsh.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals">Washington Nationals</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> It seems the Nationals will use the savings on Willits at the No. 1 pick on high schoolers Landon Harmon, Coy James, Miguel Sime Jr., and possibly Mason Pike, who all rank just outside of this top 10 but come with big upsides if everything clicks. The Nats should add more prospects at the deadline and only House and maybe Cavalli seem likely to graduate before the season ends.</p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png" width="100%"></p><h2>NL Central</h2><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/chc.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs">Chicago Cubs</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> <a data-player-guid="0fb7a375-aa88-3a2d-a8ec-698f8f1949a8" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4692526/cade-horton">Cade Horton</a> and <a data-player-guid="13a9edb7-04d4-3c62-85d7-8fcc41b9104b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4867667/matt-shaw">Matt Shaw</a> have graduated during the season, and Birdsell just returned to the mound. Conrad was the Cubs' first-round pick and Hartshorn (sixth round, No. 55 on my board) is narrowly ahead of second-round pick Kane Kepley (No. 57 on my board), who are both just ahead of Kaleb Wing (fourth round). The last couple of spots on the list could change by the end of the season.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cin.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="04b65a0b-3cca-d795-0e21-23606470418a" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds">Cincinnati Reds</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> Shortstops Sammy Stafura and Edwin Arroyo were the last two cuts, and you could justify flipping them with the last two players on the list. The Reds are still in the playoff race and Burns probably will graduate in the next month, so this system will slip a bit from here.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mil.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="4750d73d-d92e-b390-758c-2c7b44a810db" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> Third baseman Andrew Fischer, a 2025 first-rounder, is among the next few players outside of the top 10. This might be the deepest system in all of baseball and is a good example of how this organization can keep competing almost every year, because the pipeline is pretty full right now.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/pit.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season: </strong>Right-hander Angel Cervantes, a 2025 second-rounder, joins last year's highly drafted prep righty Levi Sterling (pretty similar prospects, both from Southern California) in just missing the list.</p><p>The Pirates would seem likely to be adding prospects at the deadline but also could promote Chandler at any point and his graduation would obviously hurt the system ranking in the winter.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/stl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> The Cards are still right in the thick of the wild-card race and there is some real depth to the catching and starting pitching in the system, but it's unclear if the organization will choose to push chips into the middle at the deadline or in aggressively promoting Doyle to potentially help in the big leagues this summer.</p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png" width="100%"></p><h2>NL West</h2><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/ari.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="43e14a76-ff66-49ed-24fc-2835932f99dd" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> The top of the list has been steady for the last month or so and the last cut this month is last year's surprise No. 35 pick shortstop J.D. Dix, who is arrow-up in the last month or two. This system has a chance to continue improving if the D-backs decide to add prospects in deadline trades.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/col.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="f3f1ba71-05f1-a49a-0363-3b1d8e0db4cf" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies">Colorado Rockies</a></h2><p><strong>Where they stand entering trade season:</strong> <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719068/chase-dollander">Chase Dollander</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4917787/adael-amador">Adael Amador</a> have graduated, and compensation second-round pick Max Belyeu ranks 11th.
