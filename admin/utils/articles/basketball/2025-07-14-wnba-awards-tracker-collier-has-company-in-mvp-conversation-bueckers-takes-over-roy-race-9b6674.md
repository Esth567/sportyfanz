She is a versatile one-on-one defender as well as working well in a system with her Storm teammates.

Sixth in the league in scoring, averaging 19.4 points per game, Gray is shooting 42.6% from the field. She's also shooting 41.6% from 3 on 5.9 attempts per game, which are both career highs.

Burke has started the past three games as Sandy Brondello has favored smaller units in Jonquel Jones' absence, bringing her to six total starts in 19 games. Burke has actually been more productive as a reserve, averaging 10.0 PPG off the bench and 7.7 PPG as a starter, but her hot 3-point shooting has carried over. Burke is making 48% of 3s as a reserve and 50% in starts, in addition to supplying key perimeter defense for a Liberty team that lost both Thornton and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton from last year's championship squad.</p><p><em>(Burke was also the front-runner in June.)</em></p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45698379,whitelist-BJ|KN|ST|NI|CF|SL|MF|VI|NA|CR|UG|SV|ZA|SN|GY|AO|GT|MG|NZ|SC|TG|AS|GF|PA|RE|ML|AG|BR|GH|TZ|GA|TT|BQ|ZW|GW|KY|BS|HN|RW|TC|GM|GB|UK|GP|CU|MZ|ZM|DO|NG|CG|GQ|AI|ER|JM|BW|PE|VC|CM|LS|AR|CL|UM|HT|MU|AU|ET|CV|BO|AM|MH|GU|GD|LC|VE|CO|PW|MQ|EC|SS|SX|AW|MP|KM|KE|LR|MX|BI|SZ|BZ|MS|BM|MW|VG|PY|GN|US|PR|CD|BF|FJ|FM|UY|BB|CI|SR|NE|" data-cerebro-id="686dd1f17bd3d32baee89243" data-title="Liberty win 6th straight vs. the Aces" data-source="espn" data-contributing-partner="wsc"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0709%2Fee22170f%2D7431%2D4fe3%2D818d%2D54f879339a83%2Fee22170f%2D7431%2D4fe3%2D818d%2D54f879339a83.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0709%2Fee22170f%2D7431%2D4fe3%2D818d%2D54f879339a83%2Fee22170f%2D7431%2D4fe3%2D818d%2D54f879339a83.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0709%2Fee22170f%2D7431%2D4fe3%2D818d%2D54f879339a83%2Fee22170f%2D7431%2D4fe3%2D818d%2D54f879339a83.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45698379">play</span><figcaption><p>1:59</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Liberty win 6th straight vs. the Aces</p><p>The New York Liberty won their sixth straight game against their rival, the Las Vegas Aces 87-78.</p></div></div><p><strong>Top challenger:</strong> <a data-player-guid="b8b701ef-ec68-672e-14ee-86d37130f590" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3906949/jessica-shepard">Jessica Shepard</a>, Minnesota Lynx</p><p>Shepard got a first-place vote last time before missing two weeks to participate in EuroBasket with Slovenia.

And when looking at how they have far exceeded expectations, it's impossible not to credit Nakase. She has voiced confidence in her team since Day 1. But it's one thing to have faith in your players and make them believe in themselves, but it's another to actually go out and perform. The Valkyries have.</p><p>Golden State is 10-9, good for the sixth seed in the WNBA. Their 10 wins is the most by an expansion franchise in history -- and we're only halfway through the season. The Valkyries also hold a better record than reigning MVP Wilson's Las Vegas Aces and Caitlin Clark's Indiana Fever, two teams we projected could be title contenders. Golden State also has the second-best defense in the league behind only Minnesota, and boasts a top-10 offense as well.</p><p><strong>Top challenger:</strong> Nate Tibbetts, Phoenix Mercury</p><p>In his second season with Phoenix, and the first with this core group of players, Tibbett has turned the Mercury into a contender.
