        <p>Could expansion be on the horizon for the <a href="https://cbssports.com/nba/">NBA</a>? The league is set to embark on the first formal step in the process, according to commissioner Adam Silver.&nbsp;</p><p>At the Board of Governors meeting Tuesday in Las Vegas, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nba-expansion-board-of-governors-silver-11a55f9b6598373215263fe969c27d40" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver told reporters</a> that league owners instructed the <a href="https://cbssports.com/nba/">NBA</a> to conduct an in-depth analysis of its options. It is a small yet important box to check on the extensive to-do list that comes with league expansion and could get the ball rolling for a 31st team to enter the picture.</p><p>Silver previously hinted towards expansion as a possibility, and just last month he said the topic could be discussed. It was not on the league's agenda in recent years but might become a higher priority now that other big-picture items like the CBA and media rights deal are finalized.</p><p>"I think there is a significant step now in that we are now engaging in this in-depth analysis, something we weren't prepared to do before," Silver said <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nba-expansion-board-of-governors-silver-11a55f9b6598373215263fe969c27d40" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">via The Associated Press</a>. "But beyond that, it's really Day 1 of that in-depth analysis. And so, in terms of price, potential timing, it's too early to say. It is truly a complicated issue."</p>

<p>The NBA's advisory finance and strategy committees will handle the analysis. There is no timetable for that process to play, but it could be a topic of discussion when the board of governors meets again -- likely in September.</p><p>Seattle is the most obvious candidate to land an expansion team, but there would almost certainly be other interested cities. Las Vegas is a burgeoning sports hotbed that in recent years added <a href="https://cbssports.com/nhl/">NHL</a> and <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a> franchises and is on the verge of getting its first <a href="https://cbssports.com/mlb/teams/">MLB team</a>. Those two would likely be the frontrunners in the race to land a franchise, and the NBA could keep an even number of teams under its umbrella if it were to select both cities.</p><p>Bringing basketball back to Seattle and welcoming Las Vegas to the league would reduce the travel burden on the rest of the Western Conference. It would also tap into a pair of sizable markets and make amends to <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thunders-shared-sonics-history-still-strikes-a-nerve-in-seattle-where-fans-will-hate-watch-2025-nba-finals/" target="_blank">a Pacific Northwest city that has long felt wronged</a></span> by the SuperSonics being relocated to Oklahoma City in 2008.</p>
        

<p>The NBA's last wave of expansion came more than 20 years ago when the Charlotte Bobcats entered the league for the 2004-05 season. One challenge with adding teams is that it dilutes the existing franchises' stake in the league and its economics. But with the NBA inking new media rights contracts worth $76 billion, it could be time to strike while the iron is hot.</p>
