But overall, the Lynx (19-4) have been the league's most consistent and cohesive team all season.

Anchored by its top-5 defense, Golden State is limiting opponents to the second-lowest scoring in the league at 78.6 points per game. Only the Lynx allow fewer points (75.3). The Valkyries have consistently impressed with how they've stayed competitive in nearly every game -- even the losses. Golden State hasn't dropped a contest by more than nine points since June 5. The Valkyries also picked up a 19-point win over the Fever in Caitlin Clark's first game back from a groin injury.

But this roster needs to look different next year to best take advantage of Bueckers' talent. -- <em>Voepel</em></p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45664108,whitelist-BR|BJ|LS|ZW|SV|HN|HT|AR|AW|GD|UG|PR|AM|GB|UK|MU|GP|GW|MX|PW|BZ|ET|DO|MZ|TC|MW|CL|KE|LR|GM|NE|ZM|ST|MS|CV|FM|NG|MP|RE|PE|BS|MQ|SS|GT|TZ|AS|CF|JM|US|GU|VI|UM|VC|BW|CM|AO|NI|MF|TG|CR|BQ|KN|SR|KM|VE|SN|SL|CO|TT|CD|GA|GY|GF|PY|BI|GH|AI|SC|EC|AG|BF|KY|SZ|LC|MH|BM|VG|RW|FJ|GN|CU|MG|ER|CI|BO|BB|NA|UY|GQ|AU|CG|SX|ML|ZA|NZ|PA|" data-cerebro-id="68673d56b7228b65b246dac0" data-title="Paige Bueckers, Aziaha James combine for 51 in win" data-source="espn" data-contributing-partner="wsc"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0703%2Fss_20250703_223255523_28873491357%2Fss_20250703_223255523_28873491357.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0703%2Fss_20250703_223255523_28873491357%2Fss_20250703_223255523_28873491357.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0703%2Fss_20250703_223255523_28873491357%2Fss_20250703_223255523_28873491357.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45664108">play</span><figcaption><p>1:52</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Paige Bueckers, Aziaha James combine for 51 in win</p><p>Paige Bueckers and Aziaha James combine for 51 points as the Wings take down the Mercury.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/wnba/500/lv.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="c97eb968-6e82-9785-a302-0bb1a1c1d064" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-aces">Las Vegas Aces</a>: D</h2><p>It's hard to diagnose what has gone wrong for the Aces (10-11) as they stumble toward the All-Star break. Their defense has been a struggle, going from a top-5 defense in 2024 to a bottom-5. They also have the fourth-worst offensive rating in the league. The Aces squeaked out a much-needed win over the Valkyries over the weekend, but it came on the heels of blowing a 15-point lead against the Mystics -- Las Vegas' largest blown lead of the season. At this point, it's concerning that Las Vegas hasn't been able to shake off the rocky start, or figure out exactly what is causing the struggles. It's going to take an incredible second half of the season to make the Aces a competitive postseason team.</p><p><strong>First-half MVP:</strong> Three-time MVP <strong><a data-player-guid="9d049a87-30bf-a718-0206-b47ef02f57df" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3149391/aja-wilson">A'ja Wilson</a></strong> has been the lone bright spot for the Aces' season -- and in the four games she missed her importance was highlighted even more.

There just isn't enough talent around her to give her another shot at the playoffs this year. Hopefully, she has at least a few years left to get another chance at the postseason. -- <em>Voepel</em></p>
