Sparks 1H TT over 40.5 (-115)</p><p>Los Angeles has had issues on the defensive end, but have excelled offensively in 2025. The Sparks enter Tuesday's matchup averaging 82.5 points per game this season. This is a spot where I expect them to finish with a point total in the mid-80's or higher. Look for a fast start from the Sparks here.</p><p>Kelsey Plum 20+ total points (+145)</p><p>Plum leads the Sparks in scoring, averaging 20.1 points per game this season. The former Washington standout has scored 20 or more points in five of her last seven games, including a 23-point performance against Connecticut on Sunday. I expect Plum to come out firing on Tuesday and finish with well over 20 points against the Mystics.&nbsp;</p><h2>Want more WNBA picks for today?</h2><p>You can also see today's top WNBA picks from experts Calvin Wetzel and Aaron Barzilai, who went 202-111-2 (+57.9 units) during the 2024 WNBA season. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/wnba-picks-proven-experts-include-mercury-valkyries-total-among-mondays-best-bets/#ttag=07152025_cbssports_picks_basketball_wnba_Kaylor_July15FREEwnbaSparksMystics" target="_blank">Visit SportsLine to see his best plays for today, all from the experts who are up almost 58 units</a>.&nbsp;</p>
