<p>Here is a look at the WNBA All-Star uniforms in the past and how they've evolved.</p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png" width="100%"></p><p><b>2006: East 98, West 82 </b></p><p>The WNBA, which had a partnership with Reebok at the time, introduced its separate conference jerseys which contained the league's logo colors. The East All-Stars wore white and the West All-Stars wore orange. Players' numbers were present on the front of their jerseys with just their last names on the back. A patch of the player's designated team was placed just above the name.</p><hr><p><b>2007: East 103, West 99 </b></p><p>Capitalizing on the first All-Star Game look, the 2007 uniforms featured a star design along the side. The league went with the look in the 2009 All-Star Game after skipping 2008 because of the Beijing Summer Olympics.</p><hr><p><b>2011: East 118, West 113 </b></p><p>After going with a white jersey for the East since the beginning of the All-Star Game uniform era, the league switched to black uniforms.</p><hr><p><b>2015: West 117, East 112 </b></p><p>The redesign included a lighter jersey with an outlined font that became the league's signature look for the next few seasons. Each player had their number on the front of the jerseys and their team logo patch on the back.</p><hr><p><b>2018: Team Parker 119, Team Delle Donne 112 </b></p><p>The WNBA switched up its format in 2018 from East and West All-Stars to selecting team captains, allowing opposite conferences to play on the same squad. Similar to the NBA All-Star look, Nike designed the uniforms using only black and white swatches. Each player's jersey included their colorless team logo on the top left. A white "W" was placed across the front of the jersey with "NBA" in gray.</p><hr><p><b>2019: Team Wilson 129, Team Delle Donne 126 </b></p><p>The trend of paying homage to the host city and team came into play in 2019. Captain Elena Delle Donne's team wore white jerseys while A'ja Wilson's team sported red with gold trimming, inspired by the <a data-clubhouse-guid="c97eb968-6e82-9785-a302-0bb1a1c1d064" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-aces">Las Vegas Aces</a>.</p><hr><p><b>2021: Team WNBA 93, Team USA 83 </b></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused the All-Star Game to go on a two-year hiatus and the 2020 Tokyo Games to be postponed to the following summer. With the Olympics being held during the regular season, the WNBA introduced the Team USA vs. WNBA All-Stars format. Though Team USA wore its jerseys in the exhibition, the WNBA All-Stars reverted back to orange jerseys with "WNBA" in big lettering following "All-Stars" in a smaller font across the bottom.</p>
