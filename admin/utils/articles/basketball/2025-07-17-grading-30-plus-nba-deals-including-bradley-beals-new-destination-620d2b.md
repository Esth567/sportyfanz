One surprising stat: Powell, who is coming off a career year, is a month <i>older</i> than Beal.</p><p>Still, I can get why the Clippers preferred having both Beal and Collins to Powell and whoever else they could have added using the remainder of their non-taxpayer midlevel exception, even if it cost them a second-round pick (sent to the <a data-clubhouse-guid="77cea2fb-1388-b7c8-d171-2e72b3aecbfb" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/utah/utah-jazz">Utah Jazz</a> in the trade) to make that exchange.</p><p>Although he's no longer an All-Star, Beal's skill set scales down well. More of a volume 3-point shooter during his high-scoring days with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="64d73af6-b8ec-e213-87e8-a4eab3a692e7" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/wsh/washington-wizards">Washington Wizards</a>, Beal hit 41% of his 3s during two seasons with the Suns. And with his role on offense diminished, Beal put more of his energy toward creating for others and defense, two important factors for the Clippers.</p><p>Specifically, Beal's most important benefit to the Clippers seems to be leading a second-unit backcourt alongside <a data-player-guid="db759921-c2d4-28de-f1eb-66f1c0aa708f" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3037789/bogdan-bogdanovic">Bogdan Bogdanovic</a> with Harden on the bench. Without a traditional point guard behind Harden at the moment -- though <a data-player-guid="63c7648a-60ba-c799-d355-f7f1d43f3a55" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul">Chris Paul</a> remains an unrestricted free agent -- the Clippers appear headed toward having Beal and Bogdanovic fill that role by committee.</p><p>Though the idea of Beal as a starting point guard lost its luster in Phoenix, he and Bogdanovic should provide sufficient playmaking against second units.</p><p>Presumably, the Clippers will at least begin the season accomplishing that goal by staggering Beal's minutes with Harden's after they start together in the backcourt. It's hard to see Beal signing up for a return to the bench after unhappily playing that role during the second half of last season.</p><p>Come the playoffs, assuming the Clippers get there in a loaded Western Conference, Ty Lue's decisions on which players to start could become more complicated. Starting Collins alongside <a data-player-guid="314d5203-a973-39ef-ad47-e6bcd46f77fd" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4017837/ivica-zubac">Ivica Zubac</a> in the frontcourt might be the Clippers' best option, but that would leave <a data-player-guid="87ff907c-c68c-a82d-1215-37e05d0c62ef" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> as the team's primary wing defender, a role the Clippers probably want to take off his plate as much as possible to keep Leonard fresh for offense. <a data-player-guid="3bf37b82-bc22-d882-7cfa-0092b896e87a" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991139/kris-dunn">Kris Dunn</a> or <a data-player-guid="43d66d12-a645-9585-46c2-d9d5fc2eb879" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936099/derrick-jones-jr">Derrick Jones Jr</a>. might fit better starting on the wing than Beal in that scenario.</p><p>At this point, we'll consider that a good problem. The Clippers have an 82-game regular season to get through, and their depth will be important given the amount of time Beal -- who last played more than 53 games in the shortened 2020-21 campaign -- and Leonard tend to miss.</p><p>Adding Beal at a max salary, particularly given the complication of his no-trade clause, proved a net negative for the Suns. The story is different now that the Clippers are getting him at a wildly different price point, with a player option giving Beal the chance to make up the money he gave back in a buyout or potentially even come out ahead if he plays well this season.</p><p>It's worth addressing the Phoenix side of the equation. To some degree, the Suns might have benefited from the NBA rule limiting how much dead salary teams can have on their books after completing a waive-and-stretch. That meant Beal had to agree to reduce his guaranteed salary by nearly $14 million at a minimum for a legal buyout of this type, putting a floor on negotiations.</p><p>Like the <a data-clubhouse-guid="f59bbabc-eedb-9ad2-c5dd-9bcd9f450a2f" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks">Milwaukee Bucks</a> with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6606/damian-lillard">Damian Lillard</a>, the Suns will have Beal's salary on their books for five years if they agree to stretch it, with the upside of possibly getting out of the luxury tax altogether, per ESPN's Bobby Marks.</p><p>Before we see how Phoenix responds, I wouldn't take this as an indication that owner Mat Ishbia is retrenching on spending along the lines of what we saw with Mikhail Prokhorov in Brooklyn after the Nets' trade for Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce went bust.</p><p>After all, the limitations on teams spending over the second luxury tax apron in the new collective bargaining agreement mean there are basketball benefits to the Suns reducing their payroll by stretching Beal's salary. In fact, they could use the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel exception now, though it's unclear there are any free agents remaining that would sign up for that but not the veteran's minimum.</p><p>Getting out of the second apron will allow Phoenix to aggregate salaries in trades and mean the Suns will have access to their non-taxpayer midlevel exception next summer if they lose center <a data-player-guid="93b211a2-3229-3b90-8529-f7f39ce5374d" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4701232/mark-williams">Mark Williams</a> as a restricted free agent or he re-signs for his qualifying offer.</p><p>I'm still not sure stretching Beal's salary will prove better for the Suns on the court in the long term than just riding out his remaining two seasons, but given how unpleasant his time in Phoenix seemed for both sides, I understand the desire to simply move on.</p><hr><h2>July 10: Thunder extend Williams on a five-year deal</h2><ul><li><p><em>Oklahoma City Thunder agreed to a five-year, maximum extension with forward <a data-player-guid="2381f346-9247-3ba1-b632-fcef378a2799" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4593803/jalen-williams">Jalen Williams</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/okc.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade:</strong> Pass (extensions graded on a pass/fail scale)</p><p>The third and presumably final max rookie extension for a 2022 first-round pick essentially split the difference between the first two.</p><p>Like <a data-player-guid="b121848a-30d3-3fad-b6ab-74bf04005533" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432573/paolo-banchero">Paolo Banchero</a> of the <a data-clubhouse-guid="74c23102-8c27-c8e6-ec1b-8a8fd4d42554" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic">Orlando Magic</a>, the other 2022 first-rounder to make an All-Star Game, Williams received 30% max criteria in his deal that will increase its value to a maximum of a projected $287 million if he makes All-NBA first team this season or is voted MVP or Defensive Player of the Year.</p><p>Given Williams was an All-NBA third-team pick last season at age 23, the Thunder should certainly prepare as if he'll make more than the 25% max teammate <a data-player-guid="d28316e9-20cc-3cb2-b5d7-afdb6418315b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433255/chet-holmgren">Chet Holmgren</a> will get on his max extension, agreed to Wednesday.</p><p>As with Holmgren, Williams did not get the player option that Banchero secured in his extension. That's especially important as Oklahoma City plans well into the future. Williams wouldn't begin a potential supermax extension -- or hit unrestricted free agency -- until 2031-32 at the earliest.</p><p>Given Williams has accomplished more through three seasons than Banchero, including averaging 23.6 points in the NBA Finals, he certainly had a case for securing a player option.</p><p>From a big-picture standpoint, the Thunder now have both Holmgren and Williams under contract through 2030-31 and MVP <a data-player-guid="4dcec409-3ff9-2881-2bc3-b4289ce6c36d" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a> signed through 2029-30 (with a player option for 2030-31) after he completed his own supermax extension last week.</p><p>The size of those contracts, which guarantee the three players approximately 85% of the salary cap when Gilgeous-Alexander's deal begins in 2027-28, will present challenges to Oklahoma City maintaining its depth. But the Thunder have been planning for that moment since before drafting Holmgren and Williams and have the financial flexibility and draft picks to ensure continued contention throughout their stars' prime years.</p><hr><h2>July 9: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45705332/devin-booker-agrees-2-year-145m-max-extension-suns">Booker gets max extension from Suns</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid="c6eade89-5971-0e84-8ccb-cd91482b2b50" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns">Phoenix Suns</a> agreed to a reported two-year, max extension with guard <a data-player-guid="493046d7-fa60-d8a1-1397-b9a6dca8dedf" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker">Devin Booker</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/phx.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade:</strong> Fail (extensions graded pass/fail)</p><p>This extension adds two years to Booker's contract, which already runs through 2027-28, starting at the maximum 35% of the cap when it's set in the summer of 2028. Currently, that's estimated at $70 million, which could be the largest salary in the NBA depending on how much the cap grows from the 2026-27 season, when <a data-player-guid="4dcec409-3ff9-2881-2bc3-b4289ce6c36d" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a> begins a supermax extension.</p><p>It doesn't take advanced statistical projections to suggest that Booker will probably not merit a $70 million-plus salary. Despite playing 75 games last season, his most since 2016-17, Booker was neither chosen an All-Star nor to an All-NBA team. He's made All-NBA just twice in his career and only received MVP votes once. (That came in 2021-22, when Booker finished fourth in the voting and was chosen for the All-NBA first team.)</p><p>During his prime, Booker has been more like a top 25 NBA player than a top 10 one. And while he should still be an All-Star contender by the time this extension kicks in, shortly before his 32nd birthday, it's more likely that Booker will be a complementary piece than the centerpiece the Suns have made him.</p><p>It's understandable that Phoenix would value a star player who wants to be there after the Suns traded <a data-player-guid="dc324fde-eee8-98e2-09ac-d31d8ad9909e" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant">Kevin Durant</a> and as they consider a buyout for <a data-player-guid="fb35d5ac-5dde-c5ee-98f3-c348c244c0ae" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6580/bradley-beal">Bradley Beal</a>. Booker has played his entire career in Phoenix and was the most important catalyst as the Suns went from 10 consecutive seasons in the lottery to the 2021 NBA Finals. Yes, <a data-player-guid="63c7648a-60ba-c799-d355-f7f1d43f3a55" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul">Chris Paul</a> was key to that season, but Paul likely would not have come to Phoenix without the promise Booker showed.</p><p>Still, Booker's loyalty didn't translate into any kind of discount, and the Suns are taking a considerable risk by agreeing to this extension with so much time remaining on Booker's current contract.</p><p>One key question in evaluating any extension is whether a player will have more trade value after striking the deal. In this case, because Booker will get the maximum raise between the two seasons of the deal, he won't be tradeable for six months. The question is more a hypothetical one. I suspect Booker would have more value to other teams on his current contract.</p><p>Certainly, Phoenix hopes that question is moot and the team can rebuild a contender around him. In the event the Suns' missing draft picks and a potential stretch of Beal's contract doom them to remain in the lottery, either Booker's commitment to The Valley or his trade value might be tested before this extension even begins.</p><hr><h2>July 9: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45700873/chet-holmgren-agrees-rookie-max-extension-thunder">Holmgren agrees to max deal with OKC</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid="bd458c44-2d33-47eb-cebc-35d3d4ac595c" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> agreed to a reported five-year, max rookie extension with center <a data-player-guid="d28316e9-20cc-3cb2-b5d7-afdb6418315b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433255/chet-holmgren">Chet Holmgren</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/okc.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade:</strong> Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail)</p><p>Compared with the other two max rookie extensions we expect from the 2022 first round -- one for <a data-player-guid="b121848a-30d3-3fad-b6ab-74bf04005533" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432573/paolo-banchero">Paolo Banchero</a> reported Monday and one yet to be completed with Holmgren's Thunder teammate <a data-player-guid="2381f346-9247-3ba1-b632-fcef378a2799" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4593803/jalen-williams">Jalen Williams</a> -- this was a bit less of a no-brainer.</p><p>From a performance standpoint, Holmgren has met expectations since being drafted No. 2 behind Banchero. He finished second to <a data-player-guid="0e8844b2-d923-3926-82d2-f19a29d69490" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama">Victor Wembanyama</a> in Rookie of the Year voting and was one of three double-figure scorers for Oklahoma City during the team's championship run.</p><p>Given Holmgren's ability to impact a game at both ends with his 37% career 3-point shooting and 2.3 blocks per game, there's a case to be made that he has been more effective on a per-minute basis than Banchero despite not being named to an All-Star team.</p><p>Yet durability remains a concern with Holmgren, who has missed extended periods due to a pair of rare, serious injuries -- a Lisfranc fracture that sidelined him his entire first NBA season and a hip fracture in November. He has played just 114 regular-season games, compared with 198 for Banchero and 215 for Williams.</p><p>Nobody knows Holmgren's medicals better than the Thunder, however, and given their record as a front office, I'm inclined to believe them that his fluke injuries don't tell us anything about his health going forward despite any concerns about his thin frame.</p><p>Although Holmgren got the max, the Thunder held the line in other areas. Holmgren did not get a player option like Banchero, and even if he reaches 30% max criteria by winning MVP or Defensive Player of the Year or making an All-NBA team, Holmgren's extension will start at 25% of the cap.

Banchero also received this in his new deal.</p><p>The other negotiating point is a player option, and teams have held the line there since Doncic and Young. <a data-player-guid="a2edb458-a371-3fba-ba5a-b24dd2fd2d9e" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4594268/anthony-edwards">Anthony Edwards</a> didn't get one coming off making the All-Star team in his third season.

The No. 1 draft pick in 2022, he made his All-Star debut at age 21 and improved his statistical output last season. An oblique tear in October prevented Banchero from making a run at becoming the first player since Doncic with multiple All-Star appearances in his first three seasons.</p><p>Still, there's a gap between Doncic -- an All-NBA first-team pick in his second and third campaigns -- and Banchero, who has yet to finish in the top 20 in All-NBA voting. (He wasn't eligible last season following the injury.)</p><p>I'm surprised the Magic weren't able to lean on the recent track record to strike a deal without a player option, which could allow Banchero to escalate his salary to the supermax a year earlier, if he qualifies, or potentially become an unrestricted free agent in 2030 near his peak at age 27.</p><p>That follows Orlando giving <a data-player-guid="a585c182-99b5-3f9f-97ec-4382128e8e9f" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4566434/franz-wagner">Franz Wagner</a> a max extension last summer, before he'd earned corresponding accolades. Wagner probably would have merited a max offer sheet as a restricted free agent this offseason, though the <a data-clubhouse-guid="926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets</a> were the only team that could plausibly make such an offer.</p><p>In the wake of Banchero joining No. 3 pick <a data-player-guid="177499ed-dca9-30ab-b6b2-d4162549fd6a" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432639/jabari-smith-jr">Jabari Smith Jr.</a> as the second player drafted in the 2022 first round to strike an extension, it's worth watching the Thunder's duo of Holmgren (drafted between Banchero and Smith) and Williams. No. 12 pick Williams is the other All-Star from the 2022 draft, and his play as Oklahoma City won the NBA championship gives him a strong case for a player option on his own max deal.</p><hr><h2>July 2: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45649142/lakers-reach-agreement-center-deandre-ayton">Ayton agrees to deal with Lakers</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid="2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> agreed to a reported two-year contract with center <a data-player-guid="9af41ea8-a24c-025f-a63f-8263fbf0ca66" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278129/deandre-ayton">Deandre Ayton</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/lal.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade: </strong>B+</p><p>After agreeing to a buyout with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a>, Ayton seemed like a fit for the Lakers, and not just because of the symmetry of pairing the No. 1 pick of the 2018 draft with No. 3 pick <a data-player-guid="583794eb-0f38-9bbd-3e25-9dd33b7f83b8" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic">Luka Doncic</a>.

Hayes shot 74% after the All-Star break, averaging 13.4 points per 36 minutes -- up from 11.8 before break.</p><p>But the rest of Hayes' skill set wasn't starter caliber, which explains why he quickly fell out of coach J.J. Redick's rotation during the opening round of the playoffs. Hayes did not reach 10 minutes in any game against the <a data-clubhouse-guid="13f727cb-254d-b484-a337-93fcc0047add" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> and was a DNP-CD in the deciding Game 5.</p><p>Ayton was one of the NBA's most prolific pick-and-roll finishers during his time with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="c6eade89-5971-0e84-8ccb-cd91482b2b50" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns">Phoenix Suns</a>, ranking third in points scored as a screen setter in both 2021-22 and 2022-23, according to GeniusIQ tracking. Ayton hasn't been nearly as effective running pick-and-roll with the Blazers' ball handlers and weaker spacing the past two seasons, shooting just 58% on resulting shot attempts as compared to 62% over his last three years in Phoenix.</p><p>Although Ayton is only a marginal upgrade over Hayes as a rim protector, his superior size makes Ayton a better defensive rebounder. That should keep Ayton on the court against playoff-caliber opposition.</p><p>By splitting the non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Ayton and <a data-player-guid="a2ffece1-7bf0-3c54-aa59-b150b6ecd315" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4592691/jake-laravia">Jake LaRavia</a>, the Lakers have gone from five players Redick trusted during the playoffs -- a group that included <a data-player-guid="e05f4c3a-a0a6-e87f-d752-a5c092b7f474" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2578185/dorian-finney-smith">Dorian Finney-Smith</a>, who left for the <a data-clubhouse-guid="78113ad4-1ac7-0c04-dada-388a6ff4e15e" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a> as an unrestricted free agent -- to hopefully six. Going beyond that number will depend on the development of the Lakers' young talent, most notably <a data-player-guid="11d78ed1-9289-39e6-9718-53544707277d" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4897943/dalton-knecht">Dalton Knecht</a>, and in-season moves.</p><p>James' decision to exercise his $52.6 million player option rather than potentially re-signing for the $54.1 million maximum salary for players with 10-plus years of experience leaves the Lakers with some wiggle room below the lower luxury-tax apron, which will serve as a hard cap for them because they used the non-taxpayer midlevel. If the Lakers keep 14 players on their roster and waive <a data-player-guid="6575a351-3a38-c256-f17d-4f2aa62ad2ce" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3915195/shake-milton">Shake Milton</a>, whose $3 million salary is non-guaranteed, they can add about $5 million in salary via trade or the biannual exception.</p><p>Depending on what James thinks of Ayton, those moves might not be sufficient to convince him the Lakers have built a championship-caliber roster after losing in the first round. The Lakers have their 2031 first-round pick or potential swaps in 2026, 2028, 2030 and 2032 that could turn the expiring contracts of <a data-player-guid="d06ad722-26ff-5865-1433-061e2e6fbb32" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2960236/maxi-kleber">Maxi Kleber</a> and <a data-player-guid="82247bd5-fd40-3926-f54f-af0cc016aa37" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3137259/gabe-vincent">Gabe Vincent</a> into significant contributors -- the kind of win-now move James would surely prefer they make in his age-41 season.</p><p>Without knowing exactly what's on the table for the Lakers, I think signing Ayton is the right call for now. He increases their playoff ceiling if accepting a buyout from Portland and signing for a small fraction of his previous max salary gets Ayton to buy in to a degree we haven't seen since he helped the Suns to the 2021 Finals.</p><p>Meanwhile, waiting will give the Lakers more information about what they need and who might become available by the trade deadline. If the Lakers put their unprotected pick and swaps on the table, they should be able to add a starting-caliber player at that point.</p><p>Of course, I'm not the person the Lakers need to convince. Nor is James, no matter how many statements he and agent Rich Paul release. The real pivot point for the Lakers' offseason will be Doncic's decision on signing an extension ahead of what could be the final season of his contract. Doncic is eligible for an extension starting Aug. 2, and that's when we'll really be able to grade the Lakers.</p><hr><h2>July 2: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45647470/sources-hornets-free-agent-spencer-dinwiddie-reach-deal">Hornets retain Mann, add guard depth with Dinwiddie</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid="377633c2-0dd1-91a1-83c0-9ed2d0c00ea1" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets">Charlotte Hornets</a> agreed to re-sign guard <a data-player-guid="9c80056b-c667-30bd-89d0-d905425b1d1c" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432819/tre-mann">Tre Mann</a> to a reported three-year, $24 million deal; agreed to a reported one-year deal with guard <a data-player-guid="d161d7b2-bf15-4c50-b638-0c8d8754efe4" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2580782/spencer-dinwiddie">Spencer Dinwiddie</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/cha.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grades</strong></p><p><strong>Mann:</strong> B-<br>

After bringing back Mann and adding Dinwiddie, the Hornets appear insistent on ensuring that issue never comes up this season.</p><p>A season-ending injury to Mann in November was a big factor in that weakness.

Mann has shot 35% over his four-year career.</p><p>Despite that quibble, there's reason to believe Mann can carve out a key role as a bench scorer.

Milwaukee subsequently agreed to a trade sending <a data-player-guid="d87adcb4-8736-4ba7-a188-250127546a89" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2578239/pat-connaughton">Pat Connaughton</a> to the <a data-clubhouse-guid="377633c2-0dd1-91a1-83c0-9ed2d0c00ea1" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets">Charlotte Hornets</a> with draft picks for <a data-player-guid="56ea0e73-183f-d714-e6e2-3469ae9cf76e" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102532/vasilije-micic">Vasilije Micic</a>. If Milwaukee can agree to a buyout with Micic, whose interest in returning to Europe was reported during last season, that should make up the difference.</p><p>In many ways, Turner is like a younger version of Lopez, whose signing helped kick-start this era of Bucks contention. Having a center who can both protect the rim and take that responsibility off Antetokounmpo's plate and stretch the floor for him on offense is the ideal scenario for Milwaukee. Besides Lopez, who is 37, the only other center in free agency who fills both of those roles is <a data-player-guid="b79dd16a-5d4b-d704-9b0c-eaa9ec3df217" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3213/al-horford">Al Horford</a> -- who is two years <i>older</i> than Lopez.</p><p>That made Turner, 29, the only real option for the Bucks to pair with Antetokounmpo through the rest of what they hope will be the remainder of his prime spent in Milwaukee. Turner is coming off the best 3-point season of his career, having averaged 2.2 per game at a 40% clip, and his career 36% accuracy is a tad better than what Lopez shot over his entire seven seasons with the Bucks.</p><p>Turner's defensive upside isn't quite as high as Lopez's. He topped out at fifth in Defensive Player of the Year voting, where Lopez was second in 2022-23. But Turner was often asked to serve as the only rim protector for the Pacers before <a data-player-guid="7c82adbb-96d7-2454-2921-535f8b8f6248" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3149673/pascal-siakam">Pascal Siakam</a>'s arrival. He has never played with a secondary defender as strong as Antetokounmpo. And opponents shot slightly better against the slowing Lopez inside five feet last year, <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*200&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT">per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats</a>, than they did against Turner.</p><p>Certainly, the contrast between Lopez and Turner was on full display when the two centers met in the first round of the playoffs. Turner averaged 16.8 PPG and 2.2 BPG as Indiana won the series in five games, part of a strong postseason run. Lopez totaled just eight points and one block in the final three games against the Pacers, yielding his starting job to backup <a data-player-guid="2f914525-c16f-def6-42db-f2a4c1d27502" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064482/bobby-portis">Bobby Portis</a> for what proved to be Lopez's final game in Milwaukee.</p><p>That said, Lopez wasn't the only reason, or even the primary reason, the Bucks lost that series. Their starting wing duo of <a data-player-guid="6fe27ee9-be2b-9ddd-d75f-18675e177915" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3134907/kyle-kuzma">Kyle Kuzma</a> and <a data-player-guid="bb4c77ff-39aa-4d30-47a4-a1e375f721d1" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990962/taurean-prince">Taurean Prince</a> was invisible against Indiana, combining for 35 points on 14-of-45 shooting. Milwaukee hasn't yet done anything to address that weakness.</p><p>If the Bucks are as serious about contending as this move suggests, it's imperative that they use their remaining draft assets (an unprotected 2032 first-round pick, plus a swap in 2031 or re-swapping picks that either the <a data-clubhouse-guid="9461f397-7882-94c0-c18c-e89bdc9e570e" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</a> or <a data-clubhouse-guid="ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> can swap) to upgrade from Kuzma. <a data-player-guid="52d9a7a4-0bee-a926-a5fd-f2ecb96eaa95" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3138196/cameron-johnson">Cam Johnson</a>, perhaps the cleanest replacement, is already off the board after a trade agreed to Monday sent him to the <a data-clubhouse-guid="c4aceb39-0eb9-a30b-1120-9cb5b12b677a" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a>.</p><p>Failing that, while I credit Milwaukee for creativity and boldness of this move, I'm not sure the Bucks are much closer to championship contention. Waiving Lillard takes away the upside of him potentially returning from an Achilles rupture in the playoffs to play at a high level. Turner, the third option at best in the Pacers' offense, is now the only player besides Antetokounmpo on the roster who averaged even 15 points last season.</p><p>If Antetokounmpo decides at some point he's ready to move on from Milwaukee, the good news is Turner should have more trade value on this contract than Lillard would have making the max. The downside is the Bucks' eventual rebuild will be saddled by not controlling their own draft picks and by the cap hit for the Lillard stretch. Milwaukee might not be able to stretch players making appreciable salary for the next five years because of the CBA rule that limits teams to 15% of the current cap as dead salary after a stretch is completed.</p><p>The news is worse for the Pacers, who lost a key contributor to their Finals run in his late prime. Indiana should now be able to use the full $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel to replace Turner without pushing into the luxury tax, whereas matching this offer to Turner would have required the Pacers to trade one of their rotation players to avoid the tax.</p><p>Still, if ever there was a time for a small-market team like Indiana to pay the tax, it's coming off getting within one win of a championship. <a data-player-guid="c4a0ba92-4e50-60af-a617-3345255115a7" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396993/tyrese-haliburton">Tyrese Haliburton</a>'s Achilles rupture in Game 7 of the NBA Finals changes expectations for the Pacers next season, but Turner would have remained a valuable starter beyond Haliburton's return to full strength in 2026-27.</p><p>Already, center depth was one of Indiana's biggest needs after two backups (<a data-player-guid="4df234c9-e02d-3a02-8e36-9955ff214fa1" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432170/isaiah-jackson">Isaiah Jackson</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432808/james-wiseman">James Wiseman</a>) suffered Achilles ruptures during the 2024-25 regular season.

The situation is dramatically different now, meaning the only question was whether Gilgeous-Alexander would sign the supermax this summer or wait until next year when he could have added a fifth year to his contract.</p><p>In an ideal world, Gilgeous-Alexander might have taken slightly less than the full 35% of the cap that a supermax extension allows as a starting point. (The actual value of the contract, currently projected at $285 million by ESPN's Bobby Marks, won't be known until the salary cap is set for the 2027-28 season.)</p><p>Gilgeous-Alexander has earned every penny of the supermax, certainly, and Oklahoma City is more prepared than any team in NBA history has been for its stars to get raises.

And the unprecedented stockpile of first-round picks Oklahoma City accumulated during its rebuild means the team will continue incorporating cheaper contributors to replace parts of the 2025 champions and stay in contention throughout Gilgeous-Alexander's prime years.</p><hr><h2>July 1: <a href="https://www.espn.com/contributor/shams-charania/31111a772dd3d">Bucks land deals with Harris, Sims</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid="f59bbabc-eedb-9ad2-c5dd-9bcd9f450a2f" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks">Milwaukee Bucks</a> agreed to a reported two-year deal with guard <a data-player-guid="80977674-266a-5c4a-16a5-f7efe9961fe0" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2999547/gary-harris">Gary Harris</a>; agreed to a reported two-year deal with center <a data-player-guid="a1f01b18-9446-26a2-5f12-cff33c2784f1" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277922/jericho-sims">Jericho Sims</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/mil.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grades</strong></p><p><strong>Harris grade:</strong> C<br>

<strong>Mamukelashvili:</strong> B+</p><p>Since sending what became the No. 8 pick of the 2024 draft to get Poeltl at the 2023 trade deadline, the Raptors have consistently valued him like an above-average starting center. Toronto re-signed Poeltl to a four-year, $78 million contract the following summer and is now giving him nearly the largest possible raise off that contract.</p><p>Technically, Poeltl could have added $88.5 million on a three-year extension after exercising a $19.5 million player option for 2026-27.

The first is it's unlikely the rest of the league values Poeltl as highly, so it's certainly possible Toronto could have gotten him back as an unrestricted free agent next summer (or in 2027) for less money and it's unlikely the Raptors would have been outbid.</p><p>The second concern is how Poeltl will age. He'll be 32 when this extension kicks in for the 2027-28 season and 34 by the end of it. Already, Poeltl's rim protection hasn't rated as well since rejoining Toronto as it did with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="8aef8547-32f5-0943-a1de-e734567674cc" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a>. Opponents have hit better than 60% of attempts inside the restricted area with Poeltl as the primary defender over the past three seasons, per GeniusIQ tracking, as compared to 53.5% in 2020-21 and 56% in 2021-22.</p><p>From a bigger-picture standpoint, the Raptors continue to invest in a core that hasn't yet proved capable of making the playoffs. Poeltl gives Toronto four starters under contract for a combined $145 million in 2027-28, and granting that one of them (<a data-player-guid="735792ca-bca3-6bab-e2ed-68f39ccc7270" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3913176/brandon-ingram">Brandon Ingram</a>, acquired at the trade deadline) has yet to make his Raptors debut, it's far from clear that this group is good enough to contend in the East.</p><p>Given that context and the lack of urgency to extend Poeltl, I would have waited. This exact deal would not have been possible once the season started, but if Poeltl was willing to exercise his player option, Toronto could have executed an identical contract before the start of free agency next summer. In signing a deal that won't kick in for two years, I think the Raptors are taking on too much risk for too little reward.</p><p>I'm much higher on the Mamukelashvili signing. He averaged 20.4 points per 36 minutes for the Spurs last season, including a 34-point outburst on 13-of-14 shooting against the <a data-clubhouse-guid="61719eb2-11c3-4e3d-90c3-0a1319fd850b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks">New York Knicks</a> in March. Mamukelashvili shooting 37% on a reasonable sample of 3-point attempts (161) was encouraging, since he has long been accurate inside the arc.</p><p>If Mamukelashvili can shoot, I particularly like the idea of pairing him with either <a data-player-guid="6c480e2e-1fcf-32b6-be64-f0cf43c4f2c5" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5107897/jonathan-mogbo">Jonathan Mogbo</a> or <a data-player-guid="8cca71b9-6ade-316f-9b13-a2486e0dbd46" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5093267/collin-murray-boyles">Collin Murray-Boyles</a> in second-unit frontcourts. Both supply the defensive playmaking that is a weakness for Mamukelashvili. For the cost, this is a worthwhile flier for Toronto.</p><hr><h2>July 1: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45632146/sources-kings-agree-3-year-45m-deal-schroder">Kings add PG Schroder on three-year deal</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid="e266c4ea-9af3-1bd8-06fb-fd608fd30e26" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings">Sacramento Kings</a> agreed to a reported three-year, $45 million contract with guard <a data-player-guid="ed50e972-a95d-6b5c-3fcd-0d75616d1159" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032979/dennis-schroder">Dennis Schroder</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/sac.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade: </strong>C-</p><p>New Sacramento GM Scott Perry seemed to signal the Kings' pursuit of a point guard when he called the lack of a traditional playmaker an "obvious need" during his introduction to local media. Although that statement is hard to dispute, I'm not convinced playmaking was actually Sacramento's biggest shortcoming.</p><p>After the Kings reshuffled their roster by trading <a data-player-guid="5f18d1cf-1c2e-3601-a04e-1a3fc84d8ef1" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066259/deaaron-fox">De'Aaron Fox</a> to the <a data-clubhouse-guid="8aef8547-32f5-0943-a1de-e734567674cc" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a> in a three-team deal that netted <a data-player-guid="dba79cae-3f61-b87b-37d9-223f39b4f516" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine">Zach LaVine</a> as a replacement, they essentially filled point guard by committee.

Then again, that's not necessarily such a bad thing. The 64-win <a data-clubhouse-guid="ec79ad1f-e6d2-7762-a2db-7fe97d35126b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> were one spot behind the Kings, while the <a data-clubhouse-guid="083a58a6-b849-3501-e67b-059290d12295" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers">LA Clippers</a> (who went 19-9 after the break) were one spot ahead. Overall, Sacramento's 12th-ranked offense after the break was less of a factor in the team's 12-15 finish to end up in the play-in than rating 22nd in defensive rating over that span.</p><p>To some degree, Schroder could help there. He's capable of providing full-court pressure on opposing ball handlers. Still, the 6-foot-1 Schroder makes the Kings even smaller on the perimeter, and he's certainly a downgrade defensively as compared to Ellis.</p><p>Offensively, Schroder has always been better cast as a playmaker off the bench than as a starter. His value has fluctuated in large part with his 3-point percentage. Schroder shot 38.5% during 2019-20, when he averaged 18.9 points and finished second in Sixth Man of the Year voting, but he hasn't reached that height over a full season while playing for seven teams in five years -- not counting two separate stints with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a>.</p><p>Schroder was at his best starting last season with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets</a>, where he hit 39% of 3s and averaged 18.4 points and 6.6 rebounds. Schroder fit like oil and water with the remaining Splash Brother after a December trade to the <a data-clubhouse-guid="77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>, shooting 37.5% in 24 games for the Warriors before being sent to the <a data-clubhouse-guid="4e096981-dc02-51d0-3dcd-2468fcc1e22d" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons">Detroit Pistons</a> in the <a data-player-guid="076edf90-d167-2d15-88cb-a174c984b9e3" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler-iii">Jimmy Butler III</a> trade.

<strong>Aldama:</strong> B-</p><p>As part of what already has been a busy offseason and presumably isn't finished yet, the Grizzlies struck a pair of new deals with current players in the opening hours of free agency.</p><p>Getting Jackson signed was the more pressing business for Memphis. Based on Jackson's existing $23.4 million salary in the final season of his contract, the Grizzlies could add a maximum of $147 million over four years on an extension after he fell short of qualifying for a supermax extension as a player with All-NBA honors. (Jackson was 17th in the voting, 13 points shy of making the third team.)</p><p>Using cap space to renegotiate Jackson's 2025-26 salary upward allowed Memphis to make a more competitive extension offer. This structure presumably adds $10 million to Jackson's current contract, allowing his starting salary to bump up to $46 million or so in 2026-27. That's still shy of the max Jackson could have made as an unrestricted free agent next summer ($50 million, based on the NBA's updated projection of a 7% cap increase), but getting more money now helps make up that difference.</p><p>All told, Jackson is adding $217 million in new money, as compared to the projected $219 million other teams could have offered on a four-max in 2026 free agency. Locking in the security of a massive deal now in a place Jackson wants to play is probably worth the modest difference.</p><p>From the Grizzlies' perspective, this is still a huge win. They take the potential of Jackson leaving in free agency off the table, as well as the possibility of him qualifying for the supermax by making All-NBA next season. Creating cap space by moving <a data-player-guid="f5096a5b-cbc5-1d7f-d406-56c623c434e5" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990992/marcus-smart">Marcus Smart</a> for expiring contracts at the trade deadline did cost Memphis a first-round pick, but I'd say that gamble paid off.</p><p>Technically, the Grizzlies don't yet have the cap room necessary to complete this deal. ESPN's Shams Charania reported that Memphis does not need to make a trade, suggesting the team will waive players and stretch its salary if no deal materializes before then. Doing so with reserve forward <a data-player-guid="d4c8df92-1ba0-32dc-7329-fd611c2cd134" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3134932/john-konchar">John Konchar</a> wouldn't create quite enough space, so the Grizzlies are probably looking at letting newly acquired guard <a data-player-guid="390cbbeb-9761-1174-69a8-831a5b201127" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432809/cole-anthony">Cole Anthony</a> go. If stretched, Anthony would count $5.2 million against Memphis' cap through 2029-30.</p><p>Trading a player or stretching their salary is necessary to allow the Grizzlies to retain full Bird rights for Aldama, who averaged career highs in points (12.5), rebounds (6.4) and assists (2.9) per game in the final season of his rookie contract. Still just 24, Aldama figures to remain a key part of Memphis' rotation through the life of his contract.</p><p>Given the limited amount of cap space available this summer and Aldama's modest qualifying offer ($5.9 million), it's possible the Grizzlies could have squeezed him more on this deal. Aldama will make far more than the $44 million that is the most other teams could have offered over this span using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception.</p><p>The upside for Memphis is getting to structure Aldama's contract in a favorable manner. I'd guess his contract will start at its highest point before descending, allowing the Grizzlies to stuff as much salary as possible on their books for this season. Memphis is nowhere near the luxury-tax line and has plenty of flexibility to use its $8.8 million room exception to add a contributor.

With Lillard expected to miss all of 2025-26 after an Achilles rupture, Porter projects as Milwaukee's starting point guard.</p><p>Porter's talent is unquestionable. He played last season at the minimum after spending 2023-24 out of the league following <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39369886/kevin-porter-jr-reaches-plea-deal-assault-harassment-charges">a plea deal on assault and harassment charges</a> stemming from a September 2023 incident.</p><p>Porter had struggled to score efficiently before landing with the Bucks at the trade deadline in February. His 41% 3-point shooting the rest of the way isn't likely sustainable, but his career-best 53% accuracy inside the arc might be legit. Milwaukee using the biannual exception for his deal was a necessary part of the team's offseason plans.</p><p>Like Porter, Trent was important in the Bucks' first-round series with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="547fc042-3e02-4795-9637-9ab84322b625" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-pacers">Indiana Pacers</a>, topping 30 points twice in five games. For Milwaukee to get Trent back using non-Bird rights (a 20% raise off his minimum salary) is a huge win. Trent, meanwhile, will establish early Bird rights if he declines a 2026-27 player option.</p><p>Prince was one of the noncontributors pushed out of the rotation against Indiana. After starting 73 games during the regular season, Prince played just 22 minutes over the last three games of the series after scoring a combined six points in Games 1 and 2. In that context, I'm a little surprised Prince earned a two-year deal with a player option. That means he'll count on the cap at his actual $3.3 million salary rather than the $2.3 million veteran's minimum.</p><p>From a bigger-picture standpoint, the question is where the Bucks are heading by bringing back their 2025 playoff rotation minus departed <a data-player-guid="3496fbc1-fa88-c332-7f91-f015006e0c8b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez">Brook Lopez</a>.

But none of this makes up for the loss of Lillard, let alone improves on a Bucks team that hasn't won a playoff series since 2022.</p><p>There are still opportunities for Milwaukee to make trades. Barring something stunning, however, the Bucks look no closer to competing for a championship.</p><hr><h2>June 30: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45622984/spurs-luke-kornet-reach-four-year-41-million-deal-sources-say">Kornet heads to San Antonio on a four-year deal</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid="8aef8547-32f5-0943-a1de-e734567674cc" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a> agreed to a reported four-year, $41 million deal with center <a data-player-guid="7a7e5cbb-0808-0a11-08e4-5b50144abcb9" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064560/luke-kornet">Luke Kornet</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/sas.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade:</strong> B+</p><p>On the surface, the Spurs signing a center when they already have <a data-player-guid="0e8844b2-d923-3926-82d2-f19a29d69490" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama">Victor Wembanyama</a> seems nonsensical, but adding Kornet is reasonable on multiple levels.</p><p>The biggest long-term need for San Antonio is probably a combo forward who can shoot, handle the ball and defend multiple positions. Alas, if that player existed in free agency, he surely would be out of the Spurs' price range. The realistic option for San Antonio was more likely <a data-player-guid="7c8ab472-985f-cf0c-8b1c-d1d051907cff" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4017844/guerschon-yabusele">Guerschon Yabusele</a>, Wembanyama's teammate on the French national team.</p><p>At center, the Spurs could shop closer to the top of the market. Kornet was prominent on <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45612014/nba-free-agency-2025-7-underrated-players-teams-target">the list ESPN's Zach Kram compiled Monday</a> of underrated free agents. Advanced metrics have consistently shown Kornet making a major impact with his rim protection and high-percentage finishing.</p><p>Since taking the 3-pointer out of his game, Kornet has shot 68% over the past three seasons. Meanwhile, as Kram highlighted, opponents shot just 52% against Kornet within 5 feet, <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*100&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT">according to GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats</a>, putting him in the top 10 alongside Wembanyama among players who defended at least 100 such attempts.</p><p>Adding Kornet addresses San Antonio's biggest weakness last season: defending with Wembanyama on the bench. The Spurs' defensive rating ranked in the 73rd percentile with Wembanyama on the court and dropped to the 9th percentile without him. Improving that weakness is the fastest way for San Antonio to reach the playoffs.</p><p>Beyond that, I suspect Kornet should play with Wembanyama at times, too. The Spurs ditched playing Wembanyama as a power forward last season after they struggled with him next to <a data-player-guid="c68386fb-23ff-62e4-b2b0-3f8843a3f35c" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066650/zach-collins">Zach Collins</a> as a rookie. Per my analysis of lineup data from NBA Advanced Stats, Wembanyama played exclusively at center in 2024-25.</p><p>Still, I think it's worth revisiting with a better center option and more shot creation around them. Double-big lineups were effective for several teams last season and are worth exploring for San Antonio.</p><p>Even if Kornet is strictly a backup center, I'd rather have him on this deal than nearly all the older big men who agreed to similar contracts Monday or the more defensively challenged players who re-signed over the weekend (<a data-player-guid="2f914525-c16f-def6-42db-f2a4c1d27502" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064482/bobby-portis">Bobby Portis</a> and <a data-player-guid="f8d497e7-586c-2aa7-4da1-3af638ca26e1" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396971/naz-reid">Naz Reid</a>). The Spurs can maximize Kornet's long-term value by starting his contract at its highest point and descending it, meaning a lower salary when Wembanyama is off his rookie deal and the luxury tax becomes a concern.</p><hr><h2>June 30: Nuggets agree to deal with Brown</h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid="c4aceb39-0eb9-a30b-1120-9cb5b12b677a" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a> agreed to a reported contract with guard/forward Bruce Brown Jr.</em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/den.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade: </strong>B+</p><p>A reunion between Brown and the Nuggets was one of the more obvious free agent fits.

A 36% 3-point shooter in Denver, Brown has hit just 33% the past two seasons, and his accuracy dipped inside the arc last season, too.</p><p>It's possible that defending bigger opponents could be taking a toll on the 6-foot-4 Brown, who will turn 29 this summer. There's a track record of players who are undersized for their position -- Brown has often played forward, and occasionally even power forward during his time with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets</a> earlier in his career -- aging early as they lose the quickness needed to compensate.</p><p>Alternatively, the Nuggets are surely hoping Brown just needs to get back to the ball movement that a <a data-player-guid="22f57511-06ae-1587-f01b-33965365ce0d" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3112335/nikola-jokic">Nikola Jokic</a>-led offense provides.

Finney-Smith, a 38% 3-point shooter over the past six seasons who hit 41% beyond the arc last season, provides more of that than Brooks. Although Brooks shot a career-high 40% on 3s in 2024-25, he's at 35.5% for his career.</p><p>There is some risk here that a four-year contract for Finney-Smith becomes a negative value by the end.

Still, locking in more guaranteed money helps explain why Finney-Smith declined a 2025-26 player option for $15.4 million that would have paid more than his new average salary.</p><p>On the plus side, the Rockets getting Finney-Smith for less than the entire value of the non-taxpayer midlevel exception could make it easier for them to avoid paying the luxury tax this season.

Sacramento was able to offer a maximum of $5.6 million, the value of that option, to LaRavia this season. The Lakers more or less matched that salary on a two-year deal.</p><p>For the Lakers, the best part of adding LaRavia is his age.

Russell actually will make less in 2025-26 on this contract, which utilizes the taxpayer midlevel exception, than he did in the last year of his rookie deal.</p><p>Of course, Russell's salary trending the wrong direction also reflects the difficulty of finding the right fit for his skill set. Russell is a high-volume shot creator (24% usage last season) who only scored with high efficiency during two seasons with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a>. Russell isn't effective playing primarily off the ball and no longer fits on a rebuilding team at age 29.</p><p>All of that made Dallas an ideal destination. The Mavericks sputtered in the play-in tournament in part because they lacked an initiator with <a data-player-guid="4fb2e3fc-ad79-d9bc-ddd9-bbb09f29ead3" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving">Kyrie Irving</a> sidelined after a left ACL tear that should keep him out much of the 2025-26 campaign. Dallas started lineups with no true point guard down the stretch, relying on forward <a data-player-guid="cdbdcd50-106b-aad8-204e-49201a429b51" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278594/naji-marshall">Naji Marshall</a> to bring up the ball.</p><p>The Mavericks certainly weren't going to do better in terms of pedigree than Russell, armed only with their taxpayer midlevel. (To even utilize that, Dallas had to agree to a multiyear deal with Irving that pays him less than a player option would have for 2025-26.) If the Mavericks catch Russell on one of the hot stretches he enjoyed with the Lakers, this could prove an enormous bargain.</p><p>At the same time, there's always an expiration date with Russell. His limitations were exposed during two playoff runs with the Lakers, as Russell shot just 31% on 3s and was targeted defensively. The ideal scenario for Dallas is probably Russell carrying the team through the regular season before Irving returns in time for a playoff run.</p><p>If Russell is able to rebuild his value, he'll likely decline a 2026-27 player option in favor of a stronger market in free agency while the Mavs move forward with Irving. So, there's a chance this is a mutually beneficial short-term marriage.</p><hr><h2>June 30: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45619586/sources-nicolas-batum-returning-clippers-opt-out">Clippers re-sign Batum to two-year deal</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid="083a58a6-b849-3501-e67b-059290d12295" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers">LA Clippers</a> agreed to re-sign forward <a data-player-guid="e83378ef-622a-a884-12bb-86482f9a84d2" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3416/nicolas-batum">Nicolas Batum</a> to a reported two-year, $11.5 million deal</em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/lac.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade:</strong> A</p><p>Both sides got a little something out of Batum declining his $4.9 million player option in favor of re-signing with the Clippers.

Per ESPN's Shams Charania, the player option is partially guaranteed, making the second season something of a mutual option.</p><p>To make that legal, Harden's 2025-26 salary must be guaranteed for the same percentage. Presumably, that salary will fully guarantee days or weeks after the contract is signed, similar to the deal J.R. Smith signed with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="ec79ad1f-e6d2-7762-a2db-7fe97d35126b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> in September 2015. The player option also gives Harden the right to approve any trade this season.</p><p>As with Smith, who declined his option after the Cavaliers won the 2016 title, the partial guarantee probably won't ultimately matter. Assuming Harden stays healthy and plays well during his age-36 season, either the Clippers will guarantee his 2026-27 salary or Harden will decline the player option and head into free agency next summer when more teams have cap space. A serious injury seems to be the only way Harden would exercise the option and be waived next summer.</p><p>The upside is that giving Harden a raise doesn't really take anything off the table for the Clippers.

He could fill the open spot in the starting lineup or get squeezed if Houston adds another forward in free agency. Either way, at 22, Smith is an important part of the Rockets' post-Durant future. We've yet to see Smith prove to be the kind of shot creator in the NBA that he was during the single season at Auburn which made him the No. 3 pick by Houston. In fact, his usage rate has dropped all three seasons to a career-low 16%. But Smith's combination of ability to space the floor (36% from 3-point range on almost six attempts per 36 minutes) and defensive versatility at 6-foot-11 gives him a floor of key rotation player on a contender.</p><p>The upside scenario is Smith continues his development and makes this contract a bargain for the Rockets.

Instead, he'll sign a new contract that should pay him a similar amount this season with two additional years at $30-plus million.</p><p>I'm surprised the market was that high on Portis, who was a finalist for the Sixth Man award in both 2022-23 and 2023-24 but has never rated that well by advanced stats. Portis was not nearly as efficient a scorer last season, when his accuracy on both 2s (51%) and 3s (36.5%) was his lowest since signing with Milwaukee in 2020. Additionally, Portis missed nearly the entire second half due to a 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy.</p><p>To Portis' credit, he became coach Doc Rivers' most trusted option at center by the end of the Bucks' first-round loss to the <a data-clubhouse-guid="547fc042-3e02-4795-9637-9ab84322b625" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-pacers">Indiana Pacers</a>. Portis played 44 minutes in Game 5, which went to overtime, and had a double-double of 14 points (albeit on 6-of-18 shooting) and 10 rebounds. With <a data-player-guid="3496fbc1-fa88-c332-7f91-f015006e0c8b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez">Brook Lopez</a> an unrestricted free agent, Portis could be Milwaukee's starting center next year.</p><p>Though Portis' contract would be on the cheap side for a veteran starter, I suspect playing that role would expose him defensively. Opponents shot 69% on attempts inside 5 feet with Portis as a primary defender, <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*3:GP*GE*10&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT">per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats</a>, putting him in the bottom 25 among all players who defended at least three such shots per game. By contrast, opponents hit just 59% of those attempts against Lopez.</p><p>I'm also skeptical of how well Portis will hold his value over the life of this contract. He turned 30 in February and will be 33 by the final season of the deal, another player option. The quickness that has been a strength for Portis when defended by centers might not remain an advantage much longer.</p><p>Every dollar counts for the Bucks, who are $27.5 million below the first luxury tax apron with nine players under contract, including non-guaranteed salaries for <a data-player-guid="e467715b-6501-c7d0-4eaf-1a91d75e7979" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397475/aj-green">AJ Green</a>, <a data-player-guid="82f7dd16-13fe-34d4-a89e-8f21c68f150c" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432190/andre-jackson-jr">Andre Jackson Jr</a>. and <a data-player-guid="3abc536f-365a-3780-8b1e-3b758ad20c98" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433622/chris-livingston">Chris Livingston</a>.

A better defender than he appears based on physical tools, Merrill maintained a key spot in the rotation with <a data-player-guid="eb092265-024f-9840-7f49-507cfcab5aab" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396907/darius-garland">Darius Garland</a> sidelined to start Cleveland's second-round playoff loss to the <a data-clubhouse-guid="547fc042-3e02-4795-9637-9ab84322b625" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-pacers">Indiana Pacers</a> -- up until a neck strain sidelined him for the deciding Game 5.</p><p>Previously on a minimum contract, Merrill had earned a big raise. Given the Cavaliers were $10 million over the second luxury tax apron after Saturday's deal for <a data-player-guid="63605956-6a4c-d187-5e83-4f0e5c740a28" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066421/lonzo-ball">Lonzo Ball</a> with just 10 players under NBA contract, that surely meant choosing between Merrill and fellow bargain reserve <a data-player-guid="c3105754-89ce-5055-3b1b-61c45e7ce40a" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065733/ty-jerome">Ty Jerome</a>.</p><p>In all likelihood, Merrill's contract will come in lower than Jerome's. This deal starts around $8.5 million with maximum 8% raises, putting it around the value of the room midlevel exception and far less than the non-taxpayer midlevel exception that could be Jerome's market.</p><p>Going out four years with Merrill could have some risk. Because he was drafted at age 24 after serving a Latter-day Saints mission prior to his career at Utah State, Merrill recently turned 29 and this deal takes him well into his 30s. Merrill's shooting ability is unlikely to wane but his defense might become an issue at some point.</p><p>With Cleveland's second-apron limitations, replacing Merrill would have been difficult, and the team can plan for a two-year window of big spending before retrenching when several contracts expire after the 2026-27 campaign. In that context, signing Merrill for a smaller starting salary but a larger total amount probably made sense for the Cavaliers.</p><hr><h2>June 27: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45599801/naz-reid-sign-5-year-125m-deal-stay-wolves">Timberwolves and Naz Reid agree to new deal</a></h2><ul><li><p><em>Agreed to a reported five-year, $125 million contract with forward/center <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396971/naz-reid">Naz Reid</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/min.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade: </strong>C-</p><p>In what looked like a difficult market for free agents, Reid found leverage to get an incredibly favorable contract.</p><p>The Timberwolves now face a challenge to also re-sign starting forward <a data-player-guid="cea0d1d3-6353-87c8-929e-c556ae36dc41" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064514/julius-randle">Julius Randle</a> (who, like Reid, holds a player option for 2025-26) and reserve guard <a data-player-guid="a67ef214-b56f-ca43-1558-7b2d13432f63" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278039/nickeil-alexander-walker">Nickeil Alexander-Walker</a>. Minnesota must make some choices about who to value, which started with paying Reid like a starting-caliber player over the span of his new contract.</p><p>That's interesting because only one other team (the <a data-clubhouse-guid="926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets</a>) could make a similar offer to Reid, and because there's not a clear path to him becoming a starter in the short term if the Timberwolves bring back Randle.</p><p>Unless the Nets were interested, Reid's market would presumably have been at the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception. That would have carried a max value of $60.6 million over four years, far less than Minnesota offered. Reid also had the option of exercising his $15 million player option for 2025-26 and taking his chances next summer, which should have been viewed as a good outcome by the Timberwolves.</p><p>Assuming max 8% raises, Reid's salary for next season will bump up to $21.6 million.

That could be enough to bring back Randle, whose 2025-26 option would carry a $31 million cap hit.

He'll turn 26 in August and will be 30 at the end of this five-year contract. Still, I'm not convinced Reid is a starting-caliber player despite winning the Sixth Man award in 2023-24.</p><p>A bench role suits Reid because of his defensive limitations, which were exposed by playing center more last season after Minnesota traded <a data-player-guid="12998df5-b137-fe32-8e90-f3844e8d8ee6" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136195/karl-anthony-towns">Karl-Anthony Towns</a>.

Although Reid has been an indispensable part of the Timberwolves teams that have reached the past two conference finals, paying him like a starter is going to force them to sacrifice down the line. Given the market, I think Minnesota should have done better with this contract.</p><hr><h2>June 25: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45582499/sources-fred-vanvleet-plans-sign-new-50m-deal-rockets">VanVleet to sign new $50 million deal with Houston</a></h2><ul><li><p><em>Agreed to a reported two-year, $50 million contract with guard <a data-player-guid="6c6e5179-fc67-908e-bc50-0a5580d64159" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991230/fred-vanvleet">Fred VanVleet</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/hou.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade:</strong> A</p><p>This deal, which will replace a $44.9 million team option the Rockets held for VanVleet in 2025-26, is some combination of Houston using its leverage well and/or being willing to spend even bigger in the future.</p><p>It's certainly true that VanVleet would have had a tough time beating this offer on the open market.

Conventional wisdom had it that Gafford could be a trade candidate this summer, given the Mavericks' crowded depth chart at center, where younger <a data-player-guid="a0268e7a-137e-3749-b75c-bedefd1177e4" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683688/dereck-lively-ii">Dereck Lively II</a> is the team's starter of the future and starting power forward <a data-player-guid="dcf63163-4dbf-c59d-1920-3ecc2f8bd5fb" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis">Anthony Davis</a> is also capable of -- and perhaps best suited for -- playing the 5.</p><p>There's little question that Gafford merits a raise coming off the best season of his NBA career. Having excelled defensively in a platoon with Lively as Dallas reached the 2024 NBA Finals, Gafford got a chance to play extended minutes between when Lively went down with a stress fracture in his right ankle in January and his own knee sprain in February.</p><p>During 11 full games in that span, Gafford averaged 15.0 PPG on 67% shooting, 10.3 RPG and 3.6 BPG, the last of which would have threatened <a data-player-guid="0e8844b2-d923-3926-82d2-f19a29d69490" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama">Victor Wembanyama</a> (3.8 BPG) for tops in the NBA. Typically just a finisher on offense, Gafford even created in the post with the team battling multiple injuries. His 52 post-ups last season was a career high, per GeniusIQ tracking, although Gafford's efficiency on those plays wasn't especially strong.</p><p>Besides the limitations on Gafford's role with the Mavericks, a trade now also makes sense because this could be the peak of his performance. Gafford will be 27 in October, and while his size won't fade, Gafford might not remain such a strong above-the-rim threat as he nears his 30s.</p><p>Based on those factors, it was important for Dallas to craft an extension with a maximum 20% raise in 2026-27 (a starting salary of $17.3 million) and 5% annual raises that fits restrictions on extend-and-trade deals. By virtue of apparently staying within that, the Mavericks can trade Gafford as soon as he signs the extension -- or, hypothetically, even before then.</p><p>Having Gafford under contract an additional three seasons shouldn't hurt his trade value at all. This extension pays him barely more than the expected 2026-27 non-taxpayer midlevel exception of $15.5 million, and Gafford has easily outpaced that in terms of value thus far. From his perspective, locking in his deal a year ahead of time does take injury risk off the table. So I'd consider this move a win-win.</p><p>The next question is which teams could be in the market for Gafford. He's an obvious fit for the <a data-clubhouse-guid="2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a>, having demonstrated his comfort running pick-and-rolls with <a data-player-guid="583794eb-0f38-9bbd-3e25-9dd33b7f83b8" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic">Luka Doncic</a>, but that idea seems triggering for already aggrieved Dallas fans. Gafford would be a sensible target for the guard-heavy <a data-clubhouse-guid="c6eade89-5971-0e84-8ccb-cd91482b2b50" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns">Phoenix Suns</a>, though finding workable matching salary is a challenge unless the Suns get under the second apron.</p><p>If the <a data-clubhouse-guid="9461f397-7882-94c0-c18c-e89bdc9e570e" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</a> aren't convinced <a data-player-guid="7fc094e9-59a0-3026-bbd8-6208f3ae1826" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5061589/yves-missi">Yves Missi</a> is a starting-caliber center at this stage of his development, Gafford would be a huge offensive upgrade. I'd also consider a return to Gafford's original team, the <a data-clubhouse-guid="e588ccf1-ba03-ea43-c34c-9a9c8d1895ca" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls">Chicago Bulls</a>, and the <a data-clubhouse-guid="8aef8547-32f5-0943-a1de-e734567674cc" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a> as wild-card possibilities.</p><p>Of course, the Mavericks may just hold on to Gafford. After all, they spent much of the second half of last season with none of their three starting-caliber centers healthy, so there is value in having depth at the position. And it would be challenging for another would-be contender to offer the perimeter help Dallas seeks, meaning a Gafford trade would most likely need to involve at least three teams.</p><hr><h2>June 14: <a href="https://preview.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45512867/sources-rockets-adams-agrees-3-year-39m-extension">Rockets, Adams agree to three-year extension</a></h2><ul><li><p><em>Agreed to a reported three-year, $39 million contract with <a data-player-guid="1173a086-95c4-a53b-2b28-3a646057f63f" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991235/steven-adams">Steven Adams</a> </em></p></li></ul><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/hou.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"><strong>Grade: </strong>B</p><p>We're off and running on the 2025 offseason with games still to play in the NBA Finals. Teams aren't allowed to negotiate new contracts with their own free agents until the day after the Finals end, but they can strike extensions with eligible players in the last year of their contracts at any point up to June 30.</p><p>Acquired by the Rockets at the 2024 trade deadline while still recovering from season-ending PCL surgery, Adams initially served as a veteran mentor on a young team and a backup to All-Star center <a data-player-guid="dad4f5fb-9739-38ac-b3b5-5d7937c29232" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4871144/alperen-sengun">Alperen Sengun</a>. His role expanded considerably in the playoffs, when lineups featuring both Adams and Sengun unexpectedly became key to Houston taking the <a data-clubhouse-guid="77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors">Golden State Warriors</a> the distance after falling behind 3-1 in the series.</p><p>Whether alongside Sengun or as the team's lone center, Adams reached a level in the playoffs that we haven't seen since early in his career. Adams blocked 1.9 shots per 36 minutes, surpassing his best regular-season mark (1.7). And his 60% shooting was way up from 55% during the 2024-25 regular season. My wins above replacement player metric rated Adams the team's fourth-most valuable player in the series, ahead of starters <a data-player-guid="653c07b5-8537-14ac-f4c6-b4e37919aca0" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3155526/dillon-brooks">Dillon Brooks</a> and <a data-player-guid="e9d2d871-df56-3068-8d5f-e3fc27f49a96" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4437244/jalen-green">Jalen Green</a>.</p><p>Given that the size and strength that make Adams a dominant offensive rebounder aren't going anywhere, the kind of agility we saw against the Warriors will make him a valuable player for the Rockets as long as he stays healthy.</p><p>Before the PCL injury that cost him the 2023 playoffs and all of 2023-24, Adams had been remarkably durable, playing 76 of 82 games in 2021-22. And Houston will surely be careful with Adams' workload. Although Adams was cleared to play both ends of back-to-back games midway through last season, the Rockets continued to give him one of the games off because of how he recovers after playing the night before.</p><p>Bringing back Adams on a contract in the $13 million range -- a little less than the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel that is the most other teams could have realistically offered -- does push Houston into the luxury tax if the team exercises <a data-player-guid="6c6e5179-fc67-908e-bc50-0a5580d64159" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991230/fred-vanvleet">Fred VanVleet</a>'s $44.9 million team option. And even if the Rockets waive two players with non-guaranteed deals (<a data-player-guid="90d9555f-b676-5eb2-7e6b-5b359799602c" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3146557/jock-landale">Jock Landale</a>, at $8 million, and <a data-player-guid="326b2250-a154-335b-b637-272db87d8667" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397821/nate-williams">Nate Williams</a> at the minimum), they'd edge over the lower luxury tax apron by filling out the roster in that scenario.</p><p>Alternatively, Houston could decline the option and try to bring back VanVleet at a smaller starting salary on a longer-term deal that would guarantee him more money at age 31. That decision could be influenced by what other moves the Rockets have cooking. Their tax situation makes it seem unlikely Houston will add a free agent making more than the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel, but the Rockets could make more substantial moves via trade.</p><p>Per ESPN's Bobby Marks, Houston has until June 29 to decide on VanVleet's player option. Barring a blockbuster trade, VanVleet will almost certainly be back, meaning Adams' new contract gives the Rockets a chance to return the entire core that claimed the No. 2 seed in the West.</p>
