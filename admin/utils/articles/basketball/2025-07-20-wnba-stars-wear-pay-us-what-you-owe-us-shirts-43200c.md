Stanford graduate and Baltimore native with further experience at the Dallas Morning News, Seattle Times and Cincinnati EnquirerJul 19, 2025, 09:06 PM ETINDIANAPOLIS -- As WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert awarded Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier the 2025 All-Star Game MVP trophy, chants of "pay them!" rained down from the sold-out crowd of over 16,000 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. The noise was booming, some of the loudest chants of the night. A small grin spread across Collier's face.The fans echoed the message players sent during warmups Saturday night when they wore black shirts that read "Pay Us What You Owe Us." The collective demonstration occurred two days after more than 40 players met with the league in the latest round of collective bargaining agreement negotiations. The players didn't think the meeting produced enough progress with a late October deadline looming.So as a national audience tuned into one of the most highly anticipated WNBA All-Star games to date, the players put a spotlight on their behind-the-scenes fight to secure higher salaries and a larger piece of the revenue."That was a powerful moment," Los Angeles Sparks guard Kelsey Plum said of the crowd's support. "We didn't, at least as players, we didn't know that was going to happen. So it was a genuine surprise. Those chants tonight, those signs, it just shows that as players, we are united, but the fans are united in believing what we're seeking.""The fans making that chant," Collier added, "that gave me chills."Knowing they wanted to make a statement Saturday night, the players gathered for a closed-door meeting in the morning and decided that wearing shirts would send their message in a clear, concise way."We wanted to do something that was united as a collective, and I thought that it's a very powerful moment and got the point across," Plum said. "Sometimes, you don't have to say anything."This isn't the first time WNBA players have used their platforms to make a public, collective stand. In the 2020 bubble, they wore several shirts to support the Black Lives Matter protests. In the second half of the 2022 All-Star Game, they wore Brittney Griner jerseys while she was being detained in Russia.Making another statement at this year's All-Star Weekend wasn't by accident. It's the only time of year when all of the league's most prominent players are gathered. On the heels of Thursday's CBA negotiations, the players believed the moment couldn't have been better.The display overshadowed an otherwise boring All-Star Game. With the support of onlookers in the arena and from afar, the players hope it will apply more pressure on the league as talks continue."The mission was accomplished because we built an incredible amount of awareness this weekend," Plum said.Players have said a major holdup in negotiations has been the salary structure and revenue sharing. According to WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike, the league and union are proposing two systems, with the league wanting a fixed percentage and the players wanting "a better share where our salaries grow with the business, and not just a fixed percentage over time."With the WNBA seeing tremendous growth in recent years -- including a new $2.2 billion media deal and skyrocketing expansion fees of $250 million -- the players want a salary structure that, in Collier's words, gives them a "[larger] piece of the pie that we helped create.""We see the growth of the league, and as it stands, the current salary system is not really paying us what we're owed," Ogwumike said of the shirt's slogan. "And we want to be able to have that fair share moving forward, especially as we see all of the investment going in, and we want to be able to have our salaries reflected in a structure that makes sense for us."The union announced on social media that officially licensed "Pay Us What You Owe Us" shirts are on sale for the public."The players are what is building this brand and this league," Collier said. "There is no league without the players, and past, present, the ones coming up, they're the ones that have put in the blood, sweat and tears for the new money that's coming in."With the second half of the WNBA season resuming Tuesday -- and the playoff race heating up -- the players will look to build on the momentum from this week.Ogwumike and Engelbert reiterated Saturday that they are optimistic a deal can be done this year."That's the plan," Ogwumike said. "We're doing whatever it takes to get a good deal done. That's exactly what we want to do."
