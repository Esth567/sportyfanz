"Based on their most recent proposal, we just aren't able to get to a place where we're actually even talking about the same thing."</p><p>The CBA negotiations have been a heavy point of contention at All-Star Weekend. The league and players' association met in person for the first time since December in a meeting the players called "a missed opportunity" to make real progress in their discussions.</p><p>"We were disappointed for sure," WNBPA vice president <a data-player-guid="3050c42f-4845-9e46-c003-1b0adb4c5e14" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3917450/napheesa-collier">Napheesa Collier</a> said on Friday.
