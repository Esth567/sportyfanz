The club's owners might regard the Club World Cup as the pinnacle, enabling Chelsea to project themselves as world champions until the next planned staging of the tournament in 2029, and Maresca was keen to talk up the importance of the win.</p><p>"I think it will become as important as the Champions League," the coach said after the game. "And we value it as much as winning the Champions League."</p><p>The reality for Chelsea's supporters, though, is that the Premier League is really what matters. Ask any Premier League supporter and being able to assert themselves as champions of England is the first priority.</p><p>But the good news for Chelsea is that their victory over PSG -- a deserved win against the best team in the world over the past six months -- highlighted the potential of Maresca and his team.</p><p>After three years of throwing money around and having a revolving door of players heading in and out of the locker room, Chelsea finally look to have built a team. The summer addition of Pedro from <a data-clubhouse-guid="78c91a3f-9e5e-c8fe-8fca-778e97cb021a" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=331">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a> might prove to be the decisive signing -- the player who makes it all fit together -- but many of the building blocks were already in place. They just needed time and patience before gelling.</p><p>Maresca also has silenced his doubters during the Club World Cup, showing himself to be tactically astute and prepared to change his approach when the occasion demands. By moving full-back <a data-player-guid="b89d5b36-af9b-ee96-1d95-3dcb40636b86" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/189007/reece-james">Reece James</a> into midfield alongside Caicedo and <a data-player-guid="b6765ac7-63b2-227c-12e8-f6342bf9405c" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/285450/enzo-fernandez">Enzo Fernández</a> to cope with PSG's midfield of <a data-player-guid="025e47e3-91a4-3a04-bd98-66fca18c9a04" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/403234/vitinha">Vitinha</a>, <a data-player-guid="3f4da3cb-c4c3-3421-91ee-b8defa5f7f53" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/355061/joao-neves">João Neves</a> and <a data-player-guid="70c7088d-af91-f008-6fde-27addeb58a13" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/214596/fabian-ruiz">Fabián Ruiz</a>, Maresca made the key move to win the game.</p><p>Prior to the final, Maresca had said that <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45718366/chelsea-psg-fifa-club-world-cup-final-upset-chess-match" target="_blank">he regarded football as being like chess</a> in that you had to outthink and outsmart your opponent. He did just that against Luis Enrique, a coach who has won trebles with <a data-clubhouse-guid="58f7c4a9-c991-4ed4-fe5c-1f833cba75b8" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=83">Barcelona</a> and PSG. If Maresca can outfox Enrique, he can do it against anybody.</p><p>But winning a Premier League takes more than winning tactical battles against rival coaches. The players must deliver too and take responsibility on the pitch.</p><p>Palmer, of course, is the ace in Chelsea's pack. He has won games single-handedly in the past, but the way did it against PSG was mesmerizing, scoring two goals before creating a third for Pedro. Palmer floats with intent across the front three but is most dangerous playing on the right then cutting inside, as he did to such devastating effect against the <a data-league-guid="b7217910-7773-3ea8-bc69-30c19c579306" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FRA.1">Ligue 1</a> champions. The England forward is a proven performer in the Premier League and good enough to be Chelsea's version of <a data-player-guid="49438d5e-de32-9f1b-9aab-5f6ae53f14d0" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/173896/mohamed-salah">Mohamed Salah</a> or <a data-player-guid="c2bc0ee8-46fa-2189-ca21-014bc1c0e7e2" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/134947/kevin-de-bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</a> by winning the biggest games for his team.</p><p>And he also seems to have struck an instant understanding with Pedro, who has shown himself to be a major upgrade on the inconsistent <a data-player-guid="ed90b32c-f09c-302e-af63-852a1e2a9352" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/308524/nicolas-jackson">Nicolas Jackson</a>. Yet when Pedro was replaced by <a data-player-guid="0406d93b-ba27-3365-9c3b-5aba080308c6" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/307114/liam-delap">Liam Delap</a> during the second half against PSG, the summer signing from <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/373/ipswich-town" target="_blank">Ipswich Town</a> also had a big impact and looked sharp and dangerous.</p><p>So, Chelsea can call on a number of real goal threats; they have an intelligent, pragmatic coach; and their midfield is tenacious and effective. Perhaps they still have issues to address in defence, but against PSG, Maresca's back four and goalkeeper <a data-player-guid="0e0f3d6b-8e88-dc88-650c-b4592e9cc766" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/108662/robert-sanchez">Robert Sánchez</a> demonstrated they can keep it tight and concentrate for 90 minutes.</p><p>All in all, Chelsea have every ingredient required to win the Premier League, and their success in the United States will no doubt have been noted back home by <a data-clubhouse-guid="a47fbcec-c948-cf4c-9e41-3dfa37588c9c" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=364">Liverpool</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="feb44e87-58fa-9597-2691-b3c32768ebe4" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=359">Arsenal</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid="94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382">Manchester City</a>.</p><p>If they can find consistency, Chelsea are back in the race for the Premier League title.</p>
