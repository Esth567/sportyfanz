The visitors are +135 favorites (risk $100 to win $135) on the 90-minute money line in the latest New York Red Bulls vs. Inter Miami odds, while the Red Bulls are +165 underdogs. A draw is priced at +270 and the over/under for total goals scored is 3.5.

The Red Bulls striker has scored 13 goals in his 2025 campaign and has been a menace around the net. </p><p> "The former Bayern Munich man has finished with 2+ shots on target in three of his last four games, so I feel like we're getting great value at +195 odds," he said. This player prop is priced at +195 at DraftKings.</p></div><h3>Want more soccer picks for Saturday, July 19?</h3><p><strong>You've seen Brandt Sutton's best bets for New York Red Bulls vs. Inter Miami.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/soccer/articles/#ttag=07142025_agg_cbssports_picks_soccer_mls_Sutton_NYRedBullsInterMiamiMLSFree" target="_blank">Now, get picks for every game from the experts who are tuned into professional soccer leagues all over the world</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
