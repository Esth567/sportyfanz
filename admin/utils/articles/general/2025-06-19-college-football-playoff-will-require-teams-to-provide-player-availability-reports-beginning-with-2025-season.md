- The College Football Playoff will now require teams to provide player availability reports for games, following the lead of the Big Ten and SEC.
- The Big Ten implemented injury reports in 2023, while the SEC did so in 2024 with a more complex system of player statuses.
- Coaches have historically resisted publicizing player injury information, but the rise of sports gambling has necessitated more transparency.
- The Big Ten partnered with U.S. Integrity to combat illegal gambling, coinciding with their change to player availability injury reports.
- The College Football Playoff recently moved to a 12-team format, with potential changes to the format for the 2026 season and beyond still uncertain.
