- Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders are receiving a 400% pay increase, marking a significant milestone for the team.
- In 2019, a settlement with a former cheerleader led to a doubling of their per-game pay from $200 to $400.
- Veteran squad members could now be making "more than $75 an hour," a substantial increase from previous years.
- The cheerleaders faced challenges in the past, including a scandal involving secret recordings in the dressing room, which led to a $2.4 million settlement.
- Recent changes, including the pay raise, highlight ongoing efforts to address longstanding issues faced by the cheerleaders within the franchise.
