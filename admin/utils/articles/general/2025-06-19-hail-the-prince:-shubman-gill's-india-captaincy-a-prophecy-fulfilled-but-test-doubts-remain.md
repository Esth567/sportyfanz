- Shubman Gill, a rising star in Indian cricket, played for Glamorgan in 2022 and impressed his teammates with his skill and knowledge of the game.
- Gill has been appointed as the Test captain of India after Rohit Sharma retired and Jasprit Bumrah declined the role due to workload management concerns.
- Despite his young age of 25, Gill's appointment as captain was seen as a long-held prophecy, given his success in youth cricket and the IPL.
- Gill's leadership skills will be put to the test in England, where India has not won a series since 2007, and he will need to improve his performance in overseas Test matches.
- Gill's confident and correct batting style has earned him praise, but he will face challenges as India is in a period of transition with high-profile retirements and recent defeats.
