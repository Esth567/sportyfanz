- Kevin De Bruyne has left Manchester City for Napoli, but Phil Foden stepped up in his absence by scoring a goal and assisting another in City's 2-0 victory over Wydad in the Club World Cup.
- Foden, who did not participate in international duty in June, has had time to rest and prepare for the upcoming season, where his role is expected to increase.
- Despite Foden's success, there are high expectations for him at City, especially with the departure of De Bruyne.
- The Club World Cup allows City to integrate new signings like Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nori, and Tijjani Reijnders into the team before the new season begins.
- City can use the tournament to put a tough season behind them and prepare to challenge for the Premier League and Champions League, with Foden playing a key role in their success.
