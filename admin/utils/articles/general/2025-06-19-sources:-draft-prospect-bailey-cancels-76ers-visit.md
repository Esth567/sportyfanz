- Former Rutgers star Ace Bailey canceled a visit to the Philadelphia 76ers ahead of the NBA draft.
- Bailey is ranked as the No. 3 prospect on ESPN's big board and his pre-draft strategy has puzzled NBA teams.
- While Bailey has not visited any teams yet, other top prospects like Cooper Flagg and Dylan Harper have already worked out for teams like the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs.
- The 76ers have not ruled out selecting Bailey despite his refusal to visit, as they have scouted him extensively throughout the season.
- Bailey's camp believes he is a top-three player in the draft and is looking for a situation that offers ample minutes and usage to maximize his potential. If not selected by the 76ers or Charlotte Hornets, teams like the Washington Wizards, New Orleans Pelicans, or Brooklyn Nets may look to move up and select him.
