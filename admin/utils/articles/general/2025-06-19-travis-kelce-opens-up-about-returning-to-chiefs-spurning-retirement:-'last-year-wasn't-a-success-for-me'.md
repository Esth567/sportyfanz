- Travis Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, has decided to return for his 13th season in the NFL after considering retirement.
- Kelce made the decision to return early in the offseason, citing his love for football and desire to prove himself further in the league.
- Despite a career-worst receiving campaign last season, Kelce has cut 25 pounds in the offseason and is determined to bounce back.
- Kelce's main focus is winning a championship, as he believes success is measured by holding up the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season.
- While retirement questions linger, Kelce seems intent on playing beyond the upcoming season and has expressed loyalty to the Chiefs organization.
