- Veteran fly half James O’Connor has been left out of the Wallabies squad for the first Test against Fiji, likely ruling him out of the British & Irish Lions series.
- Coach Joe Schmidt has chosen younger players Noah Lolesio, Ben Donaldson, and Tom Lynagh over O’Connor, citing the need to invest in the younger pivots.
- The squad includes only two uncapped players and one overseas-based player, Will Skelton, with Lolesio, Langi Gleeson, and Tom Hooper also included despite signing deals to play overseas next year.
- The Wallabies will play Fiji on July 6 in Newcastle as a trial for the first Test against the Lions on July 19 in Brisbane.
- Winger Corey Toole, who has excelled with the Brumbies, has been included in the squad, as well as other outside backs like Filipo Daugunu, Harry Potter, and Dylan Pietsch.
