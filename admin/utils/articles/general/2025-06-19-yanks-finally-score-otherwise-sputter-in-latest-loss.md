- The Yankees broke a 30-inning scoreless streak with Jazz Chisholm Jr.'s solo home run, but still lost to the Los Angeles Angels 3-2.
- The Yankees are on a six-game losing streak, and their lead in the AL East has shrunk to 1.5 games.
- Despite some offensive improvements, the Yankees struggled with runners in scoring position, going 0-for-3 in the game and 5-for-48 over the past seven games.
- Aaron Judge, a heavy favorite for AL MVP, has been struggling at the plate, going 1-for-19 with 11 strikeouts in the past five games.
- The Angels were able to retake the lead in the eighth inning due to a defensive error by shortstop Anthony Volpe, who mishandled a ground ball that should have been an inning-ending double play.
