ðŸ”¥ In the midst of contract negotiations, Hearts head coach Derek McInnes believes Lawrence Shankland has a big decision to make about his future.

ðŸ§  Shankland, the 29-year-old striker with 16 caps for Scotland, is at a crossroads as his contract at Tynecastle Park nears its end. Despite a challenging season, he finished strong with four goals and two assists in the final four games. McInnes is eager to keep him, offering a three-year extension and emphasizing Hearts as a strong option for the talented forward.

ðŸŽ¤ McInnes expressed, "I'm in constant dialogue with Lawrence... there'll come a point where we need to draw a line under it... Hopefully we can find a solution because he is a player that I think can really thrive with us at Hearts."

ðŸ“Š Shankland boasts an impressive record of 68 goals in 137 appearances, showcasing his value to the team. With the World Cup on the horizon, McInnes believes Hearts is the best platform for Shankland to excel and continue his international aspirations.

ðŸŽ¤ McInnes further stated, "I believe we're a really strong option for Lawrence, I believe we're the best option for him at this moment... Hopefully as I say we're his best option and at the minute we're in the fight to keep him."

ðŸ§  Hearts have been active in the transfer market, bringing in six new players and securing Kabangu on a permanent deal. The club is determined to bounce back from a disappointing season that saw managerial changes and a struggle to maintain a top-six position.

ðŸ“Š McInnes emphasized the need to strengthen the squad, particularly looking to add width to the team. The focus is on identifying players who can make Hearts more competitive and well-rounded as they aim for a stronger campaign ahead.

ðŸŽ¤ Regarding their transfer strategy, McInnes mentioned, "We'd still like to try and bring a bit more width to the team particularly off that right-hand side and that's been our focus at the minute... I just want to work with good players and if we can add one or two more between now and the opening game of the season then I'll be delighted."

âœ… As the deadline for Shankland's decision looms, it is a crucial moment for both the player and Hearts. McInnes is adamant about the club's desire to retain Shankland and build a competitive squad for the upcoming season. The outcome of this negotiation could significantly impact both Shankland's career trajectory and Hearts' ambitions on the pitch.
