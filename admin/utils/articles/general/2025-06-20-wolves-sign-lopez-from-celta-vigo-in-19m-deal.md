ðŸ”¥ Wolves have secured their first summer signing with the exciting addition of forward Fer Lopez from Celta Vigo in a Â£19m deal, marking the start of an intriguing transfer window for the club.

ðŸ§  Lopez, a talented 21-year-old left-footer, has inked a five-year contract with Wolves after impressing with Celta Vigo last season, netting four goals in 20 appearances since making his senior debut in October 2024. The young forward expressed his enthusiasm for the move, stating, "It's an amazing opportunity for my career to play in the Premier League and I'm very happy."

ðŸŽ¤ Speaking about his new venture, Lopez mentioned, "[Manager] Vitor [Pereira] told me he thought I was a good fit in the squad and when it's a club like this, you have little to think about." He also praised Pereira's impact on the team, adding, "The team did very good when Vitor came and I think he is top, so I'm very excited to be with him."

ðŸ“Š Lopez's journey to Wolves includes a brief stint in Suffolk in 2018, where he trained with Norwich City's academy before joining Celta Vigo's youth setup at the age of 10. His time with Celta Vigo culminated in a seventh-place finish in La Liga last season, with Lopez emphasizing his excitement for the new challenge ahead, stating, "I cannot explain with words, because it was everything I had dreamed of." He further expressed his desire to replicate his experiences in Spain by thriving in the English league.

ðŸŽ¤ Reflecting on his time in Spain, Lopez reminisced about playing at iconic venues such as the Bernabeu, Barcelona, and Atletico Madrid, highlighting the electric atmospheres that fueled his passion for the game. Now, he aims to create similar memories in England with Wolves.

ðŸ“Š Wolves' acquisition of Lopez comes on the heels of significant departures, with the club parting ways with forward Matheus Cunha and left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri for substantial fees to Manchester United and Manchester City, respectively, earlier in the summer.

âœ… Lopez's arrival at Wolves signals the beginning of an exciting chapter for the club, with fans eager to see how the young forward will adapt to the demands of the Premier League. As Wolves continue to reshape their squad ahead of the new season, Lopez's addition brings a blend of youth and talent that could prove pivotal in their quest for success. Stay tuned as Wolves' summer transfer activity unfolds, promising more thrills and surprises in the coming weeks.
