ðŸ”¥ The Indiana Pacers are on the brink of the biggest upset in modern NBA Finals history, catching the attention of influential bettors ahead of Game 7 against the Thunder.

ðŸ§  With the Pacers just one win away from a major upset, sportsbooks have seen sharp bettors placing their money on the underdog team, causing the Game 7 spread to decrease significantly. The Thunder, who opened as 8.5-point favorites, are now facing a narrowed spread of -7, setting the stage for an intense showdown in Oklahoma City.

ðŸŽ¤ Jeff Sherman, the vice president of risk for the Westgate SuperBook, noted, "With the way the series has played out, I can see people taking the [points] rather than laying." This shift in betting patterns reflects the growing confidence in the Pacers' ability to compete against the favored Thunder.

ðŸ“Š The Pacers entered the Finals as significant underdogs, with odds of +525 to beat the Thunder in the series. If they manage to pull off the upset, they would surpass the 2004 Detroit Pistons as the biggest underdog to win an NBA Finals series in over four decades.

ðŸ§  Despite starting the season slowly and being overlooked by many bettors, the Pacers have defied the odds to reach this point. Their journey from 150-1 long shots midway through the season to potential Finals champions is a testament to their resilience and determination.

ðŸŽ¤ Chris Andrews, the sportsbook director at the South Point in Las Vegas, shared, "We took sharp action on Indiana and had to adjust the line to -7 for the Thunder." This adjustment reflects the growing belief in the Pacers' ability to challenge the Thunder in a decisive Game 7.

ðŸ“Š According to SportsOddsHistory.com, the Pacers' unexpected rise to Finals contention has captured the attention of the betting world, making them a compelling underdog story with the potential to make history.

ðŸ§  Indiana's improbable journey from preseason long shots at 50-1 to potential champions highlights the unpredictable nature of sports and the excitement of underdog stories in the NBA.

ðŸ“Š At BetMGM, the Pacers accounted for just 1% of the money wagered on championship odds, underscoring the surprise factor of their Finals run and the skepticism they faced from bettors throughout the season.

âœ… As the Pacers prepare to face the Thunder in Game 7, the stage is set for a thrilling conclusion to a remarkable Finals series. Whether they can complete the ultimate underdog story remains to be seen, but their resilience and determination have already left a lasting impact on the NBA betting landscape.
