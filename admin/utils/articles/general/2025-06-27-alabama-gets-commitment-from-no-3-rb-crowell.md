In a stunning move, Alabama secures the commitment of top-ranked rusher Ezavier Crowell, solidifying their 2026 recruiting class as one of the best in the nation. Crowell, a four-star prospect and the No. 3 running back in the country, chose the Crimson Tide over fierce competition from Auburn, Florida State, Georgia, and Texas. This commitment marks a significant win for coach Kalen DeBoer, who has been under pressure to deliver after a disappointing first season with the program.

Crowell's decision to join Alabama comes on the heels of a highly successful high school career at Jackson High School in Alabama, where he showcased his talent by amassing impressive rushing yards and touchdowns. Standing at 5-foot-11 and weighing 210 pounds, Crowell is a powerful force on the field and is expected to make an immediate impact for the Crimson Tide.

Alabama's recruiting momentum has been building steadily, with Crowell being the latest addition to an already impressive 2026 class. Alongside four-star offensive tackle Sam Utu, Crowell adds depth and skill to a team that is hungry for success. With a total of six commitments in June, including recent flips from top prospects, Alabama is shaping up to have a formidable roster in the coming seasons.

Looking ahead, Crowell's commitment sets the stage for what promises to be an exciting recruiting period for Alabama. The Crimson Tide are targeting other elite prospects, such as outside linebacker Anthony Jones and wide receiver Cederian Morgan, in the hopes of further bolstering their already strong lineup. With key announcements on the horizon, including Morgan's decision on July 5th and five-star safety Jireh Edwards' impending choice, Alabama is poised to continue its reign as a powerhouse in college football.

As the Crimson Tide gear up for the upcoming season, Crowell's addition adds a new dimension to an already talented roster. With high expectations and a hunger for success, Alabama is ready to showcase its strength and determination on the field. Stay tuned as the Crimson Tide continue their quest for dominance in the college football landscape.
