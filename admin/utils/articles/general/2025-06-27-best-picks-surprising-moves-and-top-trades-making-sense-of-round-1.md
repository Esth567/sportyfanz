The 2025 NBA Draft Round 1: Winners, Surprises, and What's Next

The Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, was buzzing with anticipation as Round 1 of the 2025 NBA Draft unfolded on Wednesday night. From the first pick, where Cooper Flagg was selected by the Dallas Mavericks, to the final pick of center Yanic Konan Niederhauser by the LA Clippers, the night was filled with winners, surprises, and intriguing storylines.

One of the biggest winners of the night was the Phoenix Suns, who landed the talented center Khaman Maluach at No. 10. This pick not only strengthened the Suns' frontcourt but also injected much-needed youth and energy into their roster. Maluach's high-level intensity, rim-protection timing, and switchable defense are qualities that the Suns lacked last season, making him a valuable addition to the team.

Another standout pick was Kasparas Jakucionis, who fell to the Miami Heat at No. 20. Despite being ranked No. 11 on the top 100 big board, Jakucionis landed in an ideal situation with the Heat, a team in need of shot creation and playmaking. His ability to play multiple backcourt positions gives the Heat flexibility and adds depth to their roster.

On the flip side, the Portland Trail Blazers surprised many by selecting Yang Hansen at No. 16. Hansen, who was ranked No. 35 on the ESPN big board, made a significant leap in the draft and caught the attention of the Trail Blazers with his skill level and off-court intangibles. The team is excited about his potential and plans to develop him immediately in the NBA.

In terms of title contenders, the Oklahoma City Thunder made a move that could have a long-term impact on their championship aspirations by acquiring a 2026 first-round pick from the Kings. This strategic move could pay off in the future as the Thunder continue to build their roster for contention.

Looking ahead to Round 2, which begins Thursday at 8 p.m. ET, there are still intriguing prospects on the board, such as Rasheer Fleming from Saint Joseph's and Maxime Raynaud from Stanford. Teams will be looking to capitalize on the talent available and make strategic moves to bolster their rosters for the upcoming season.

As the NBA Draft continues to unfold, fans can expect more excitement, surprises, and game-changing picks that will shape the future of the league. Stay tuned for more updates and analysis as Round 2 gets underway, and teams look to solidify their rosters for the upcoming season.
