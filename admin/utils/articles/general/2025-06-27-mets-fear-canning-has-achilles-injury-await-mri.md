In a devastating blow to the New York Mets, right-hander Griffin Canning likely suffered an Achilles injury during a noncontact play in the third inning of Thursday night's 4-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves. Manager Carlos Mendoza confirmed the injury, stating, "He's getting an MRI, we're waiting for the result -- but it looks like an Achilles injury."

Canning, who had been stellar on the mound with one hit allowed and three strikeouts before the injury, was visibly in pain as he hopped on one leg and then collapsed to the ground with his left leg elevated. The sight of the 29-year-old pitcher being helped off the field by trainers was a somber moment for both his teammates and fans.

This unfortunate injury adds to the Mets' recent pitching woes, as Canning becomes the third member of the Opening Day rotation to be sidelined in the past two weeks. Ace Kodai Senga and Tylor Megill are already out with injuries, while Sean Manaea is dealing with a bone chip in his elbow. Despite the setbacks, the Mets managed to secure a win on Thursday thanks to the efforts of reliever Austin Warren, who stepped up in relief of Canning.

Mendoza expressed sympathy for Canning, acknowledging his contributions to the team this season. The right-hander had been a key part of the Mets' rotation, posting a 7-3 record with a 3.77 ERA in 16 starts. The timing of his injury couldn't be worse for a team that is already struggling to stay afloat in a competitive division.

Looking ahead, the Mets will need to rely on their remaining pitchers to step up and fill the void left by Canning's absence. With reinforcements like Frankie Montas returning from injury, there is hope that the team can weather this storm and stay in the playoff race. The resilience of the Mets will be tested in the coming weeks as they look to overcome the adversity of losing key members of their pitching staff.

As the Mets continue to navigate through their pitching challenges, the focus will be on how the team responds to the adversity and whether they can rally together to stay competitive in a tough division. The road ahead won't be easy, but if there's one thing the Mets have shown this season, it's that they have the depth and determination to overcome obstacles and keep fighting for a postseason berth.
