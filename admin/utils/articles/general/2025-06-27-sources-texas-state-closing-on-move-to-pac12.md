Texas State Bobcats Accept Invitation to Join Pac-12 Conference

In a groundbreaking move for Texas State University, the Bobcats have taken the final steps towards accepting an invitation to join the prestigious Pac-12 Conference. Sources have confirmed that Texas State officials have initiated the process of calling a board of regents meeting on Monday to solidify the move, which is expected to be finalized for the 2026-27 school year across all sports.

The decision to join the Pac-12 marks a significant milestone for Texas State, positioning them as the eighth football-playing member in the conference. With the looming deadline of a doubling exit fee from $5 million to $10 million on July 1, the Bobcats had to act swiftly to secure their spot in the Pac-12.

Under the leadership of head coach G.J. Kinne, Texas State has seen success on the gridiron with back-to-back 8-5 seasons and two bowl victories. The Bobcats' impressive performance on the field has undoubtedly caught the attention of the Pac-12, solidifying their position as a formidable addition to the conference.

The move not only highlights Texas State's athletic potential but also provides the Pac-12 with a foothold in the football-rich state of Texas. With a student body exceeding 40,000 and a prime location between Austin and San Antonio, Texas State brings a valuable asset to the conference.

Looking ahead, Texas State's upcoming season opener against Eastern Michigan sets the stage for their transition to Pac-12 competition. The Bobcats' first game as a Pac-12 member will see them face off against in-state rival Texas in 2026, promising an exciting start to their new chapter in the conference.

As the final details are ironed out and the formal announcement draws near, the addition of Texas State to the Pac-12 signifies a significant shift in the collegiate sports landscape. Stay tuned for more updates on this groundbreaking development and the impact it will have on both Texas State and the Pac-12 Conference.
