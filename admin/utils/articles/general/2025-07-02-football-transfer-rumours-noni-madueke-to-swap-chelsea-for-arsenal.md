The 19-year-old winger has garnered attention for his impressive performances at PSV Eindhoven, sparking interest from several top clubs.

Arsenal, in particular, has emerged as a potential destination for Madueke as they seek to bolster their attacking options ahead of the upcoming season. The Gunners are keen to add the talented youngster to their squad in a bid to enhance their offensive capabilities on the pitch.

The switch could offer Madueke a platform to further showcase his skills and make a mark in the highly competitive Premier League.
