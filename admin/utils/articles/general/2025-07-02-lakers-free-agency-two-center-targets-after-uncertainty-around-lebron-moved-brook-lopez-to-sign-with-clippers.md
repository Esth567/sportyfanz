The Los Angeles Lakers are on the hunt for a new center in the wake of Brook Lopez's departure to the Clippers, citing uncertainty surrounding LeBron James. As the team looks to strengthen their frontcourt, two potential targets have emerged in free agency.

One player on the Lakers' radar is Dwight Howard, who previously donned the purple and gold during the 2019-2020 season. Known for his defensive prowess and rebounding abilities, Howard could provide the Lakers with much-needed size and rim protection.

Another candidate being considered by the Lakers is Hassan Whiteside, a shot-blocking specialist whose defensive presence could greatly benefit the team. Whiteside's ability to alter shots in the paint could help shore up the Lakers' defense.

With Lopez's move to the Clippers leaving a void in the Lakers' frontcourt, the team is actively seeking to fill the gap with a reliable and impactful center. Both Howard and Whiteside offer unique skill sets that could complement the Lakers' roster and address their defensive needs.

In the midst of an active free agency period, the Lakers are strategically targeting players who can contribute to their championship aspirations. As they navigate the market for a new center, the team remains focused on building a competitive roster for the upcoming season.

Key Takeaways:
- The Lakers are in search of a new center following Brook Lopez's departure to the Clippers.
- Dwight Howard and Hassan Whiteside are two potential targets being considered by the team.
- Both Howard and Whiteside bring valuable defensive skills that could enhance the Lakers' frontcourt.
