Italian giants Juventus are reportedly eyeing a cut-price deal for Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho. The talented Englishman has failed to live up to expectations since his big-money move to Old Trafford and could now be available for a reduced fee.

Sancho's potential transfer to Juventus would represent a major coup for the Serie A side as they seek to bolster their squad ahead of the upcoming season. Despite his recent struggles, the 25-year-old's undeniable talent and potential make him an enticing target for the Turin-based club.

Negotiations between Juventus and Manchester United are said to be ongoing, with a deal potentially being finalized in the coming weeks. If the move goes through, it could see Sancho swap the Premier League for Serie A in a bid to reignite his career.

Key takeaways:
- Juventus is considering a cut-price deal for Jadon Sancho, who has underperformed at Manchester United.
- The potential transfer would be a significant move for Juventus as they aim to strengthen their squad.
- Despite his recent form, Sancho's talent and potential make him an attractive target for the Serie A side.
