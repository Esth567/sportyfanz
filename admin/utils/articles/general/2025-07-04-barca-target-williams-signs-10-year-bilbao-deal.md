Athletic Bilbao forward Inaki Williams has put an end to speculation about his future by signing a lucrative 10-year contract extension with the club. The deal, which includes a staggering release clause of €500 million, is designed to ward off interest from potential suitors, most notably Barcelona.

Williams, who has been a standout performer for Bilbao since joining the club at the age of 17, expressed his dedication to the team and his eagerness to continue developing as a player. The 30-year-old forward has established himself as a key figure for Bilbao, having scored over 100 goals during his time with the club.

With Williams now firmly committed to Bilbao for the long term, Barcelona will need to shift their focus to other attacking options. The Catalan giants had reportedly been eyeing the Spanish international as a potential reinforcement for their squad, but will now have to explore alternative targets.
