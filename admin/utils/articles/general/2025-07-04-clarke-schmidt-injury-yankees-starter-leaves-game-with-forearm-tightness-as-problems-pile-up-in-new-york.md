New York Yankees starting pitcher Clarke Schmidt was forced to exit the game early due to forearm tightness, further exacerbating the team's injury concerns. Schmidt underwent an MRI to assess the severity of the issue, with the results currently pending. This setback adds to the mounting injury woes that have plagued the Yankees this season, with multiple key players already sidelined.

The timing of Schmidt's injury is particularly unfortunate as the Yankees are facing a tough battle to stay competitive in the division. With the team struggling to find consistency on the field, losing a starting pitcher only adds to their challenges.

In order to weather this storm, the Yankees will need to tap into their depth and resilience to overcome these obstacles and keep themselves in playoff contention. As they navigate through this difficult period, the team will have to rely on their remaining healthy players to step up and fill the void left by those on the injured list.

Key takeaways:
- Clarke Schmidt's forearm tightness adds to the Yankees' injury concerns.
- Results of Schmidt's MRI are pending, leaving his status uncertain.
- The team must rely on depth and resilience to stay competitive and make a push for the playoffs.
