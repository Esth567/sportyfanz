The procedure, which repairs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in the elbow, typically requires a lengthy recovery period. Schmidt's absence will be keenly felt by the Yankees, who were counting on his contributions to bolster their pitching staff this season. The team now faces the challenge of adjusting their rotation and finding ways to compensate for Schmidt's loss."
