In a gripping quarter-final of the Club World Cup, Real Madrid narrowly secured a 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund, setting the stage for a highly anticipated semi-final clash with Paris Saint-Germain. The match was largely dominated by Real Madrid, thanks to early goals from Gerardo García and Fabián García, but took a dramatic turn in stoppage time with a late resurgence from Dortmund.

Initially, Real Madrid under the guidance of Xabi Alonso displayed a strong tactical setup, blending solid defense with effective attacking transitions. However, the match's nature changed abruptly when Felix Beier of Dortmund found the net in the 92nd minute.

Despite Mbappé’s heroics, Dortmund continued to press, with Serhou Guirassy scoring in the 98th minute, keeping the match tense until the final whistle. The match also saw Real Madrid’s Dean Huijsen receive a red card, a significant event as it means Madrid will be without a key defender in their next match against PSG.

Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois played a pivotal role for Madrid, making crucial saves that ultimately helped his team cling to their narrow lead.
