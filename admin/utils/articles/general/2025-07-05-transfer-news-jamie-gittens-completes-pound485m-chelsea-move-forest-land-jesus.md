In a major move within the Premier League's summer transfer window, Chelsea has completed the signing of Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for a substantial fee of £48.5 million. This acquisition is part of Chelsea's broader strategy under Enzo Maresca to fortify their squad for future competitions, with Gittens expected to play a pivotal role thanks to his speed and scoring prowess. The 20-year-old winger's performance at Dortmund caught Chelsea’s eye, and his arrival is part of a broader offensive overhaul at the club.
