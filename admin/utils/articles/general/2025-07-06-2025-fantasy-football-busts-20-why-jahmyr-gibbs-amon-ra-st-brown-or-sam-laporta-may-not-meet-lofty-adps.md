In the evolving landscape of fantasy football, several notable players are cited as potential risks for the 2025 season, according to recent analyses. Jahmyr Gibbs, a running back lauded for his collegiate prowess, is poised to join a crowded backfield in Denver. This setup could potentially stifle his opportunities and diminish his fantasy value, despite his evident talent.

Wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown of the Detroit Lions, previously celebrated for his receiving skills, may find his statistics dwindling as the Lions shift focus towards a run-heavy offensive strategy. This transition could significantly impact St. Brown's capacity to produce high fantasy points, which has been a hallmark of his game.

Rookie tight end Sam LaPorta, stepping into an NFL environment that historically underutilizes tight ends in the passing game, faces hurdles in justifying his lofty draft expectations. His integration into the team's offensive scheme will be pivotal in determining his effectiveness and fantasy relevance.

Fantasy football experts advise caution, suggesting that the decision to draft these players should not be solely based on their potential. It is essential for fantasy managers to consider the broader team strategies and the competitive dynamics that could influence these players' performances.

Key Takeaways:
- Jahmyr Gibbs' potential is challenged by a competitive and crowded Denver backfield.
- Amon-Ra St. Brown's fantasy output may decline with the Lions' new run-focused offense.
- Sam LaPorta's fantasy impact could be limited by a historically low tight end utilization in his team's passing game.
- Strategic drafting, considering team contexts and player competition, is recommended for fantasy football managers.
