        <p>All Elite Wrestling's biggest annual show returns stateside. More than 20,000 professional wrestling fans will converge on Arlington, Texas for AEW All In on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>All In harkens back to the young wrestling promotion's genesis. In 2018, before AEW existed, more than 10,000 tickets were sold for the independent wrestling show All In, the first time in 25 years a non-WWE or WCW show managed such a feat. All In has become AEW's flagship pay-per-view since 2023, drawing tens of thousands of fans. The event returns to the U.S. after consecutive years at London's famed Wembley Stadium.</p><p>There will be tons of world title matches on Saturday. The biggest may be AEW world champion Jon Moxley taking on "Hangman" Adam Page. Moxley has locked the title away since winning it, holding it hostage from the hostile crowds who want to see it at stake. Page must conjure up something to get the title while also dealing with Moxley's crew, the Death Riders.</p><p>"It's always important to me that what I give you is genuine. It's true. It's real," Page told CBS Sports this week. "There are certain things about me that even at my lowest, I won't betray. There's nothing in it for me to betray those things. These aren't necessarily conscious decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>"The me that you've seen is meâ€¦ for better or worse, a thousand times over."</p>
        

<p>Plus, "Timeless" Toni Storm defends her AEW women's world title against Mercedes Mone, who has captured seemingly every other women's title in the promotion. There's also a unified title match set between international champion Kenny Omega and continental titleholder Okada that is sure to be a classic.&nbsp;</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/hangman-page-believes-his-redemption-arc-mirrors-aews-at-all-in-texas-i-feel-the-same-magic/" target="_blank">
