        <p>Bill Goldberg's next victim will be his last. Goldberg ends his professional wrestling career 28 years after his debut, looking to add one last world title to his resume. Gunther vs. Goldberg headlines WWE Saturday Night's Main Event this weekend.</p><p>Gunther's first defense of his second world title reign comes against a bona fide legend. Gunther and Goldberg first crossed paths at October's Bad Blood pay-per-view. Goldberg returns to Atlanta, the site of their first encounter and home base of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), for Goldberg's retirement match.</p><p>"The circumstances are not always to your liking," Goldberg <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/inside-goldbergs-tumultuous-week-lead-up-to-wwe-retirement-vs-gunther-hampered-by-tragedy-injury/" target="_blank">confessed to CBS Sports</a></span> this week. "But you adapt and overcome. It's a very overwhelming time for me ... I'm not going to sit here and feel sorry for myself that at 58. I'm getting no sleep, and I'm running from one side of the country to the next, four or five days before I perform in front of millions of people on TV in my underwear and be the guy that they remember."</p><p>There are three other matches set for Saturday night as the promotion kicks off a busy weekend in Atlanta that concludes with Evolution on Sunday. LA Knight and Seth Rollins are set to throw down after Knight continually stuck his nose in Rollins' business and caused chaos for the new faction. Drew McIntyre has also returned and immediately set a date with Randy Orton upon his arrival. And the United States title is on the line when champion Solo Sikoa takes on his older brother Jimmy Uso after Uso's continued interference with the new Bloodline.</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/2025-wwe-evolution-card-date-matches-rumors-match-card-start-time-location-where-to-watch/" target="_blank">

<p>Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Saturday Night's Main Event and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on Peacock on July 12 with the main card starting at 8 p.m. ET.</p>
        

<h2>2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main Event matches</h2><p><strong><em>World Heavyweight Championship</em> -- Gunther (c) vs. Goldberg:&nbsp;</strong>WWE planted the seeds for Gunther vs. Goldberg eight months ago. Gunther provoked Goldberg, who was seated ringside at Bad Blood. After defeating Jey Uso to regain the world title, Gunther turns his attention to his most experienced opponent. WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg, a former WCW and WWE world champion, wrestles for the first time since losing to Roman Reigns in 2022.</p><p><strong>LA Knight vs. Seth Rollins:&nbsp;</strong>Knight is 0-3 in consecutive Money in the Bank matches. That undesirable distinction wouldn't be true if not for Rollins' associates, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed, interfering in the match. Knight is seething for revenge, desperate to beat the man who stopped him from ascending the mountain top.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Randy Orton vs. Drew McIntyre:</strong> McIntyre returned from a one-month absence, sticking his nose in Orton and Cody Rhodes' conversation. Orton retorted with an RKO, setting up a match between them at Saturday Night's Main Event. It's McIntyre's first match since losing a steel cage match to Damian Priest at the last SNME.</p>
        

<p><strong><em>United States Championship </em>-- Solo Sikoa (c) vs. Jimmy Uso:</strong> A late addition to the card, Sikoa makes his first U.S. title defense against someone he's ultra familiar with. Uso has had problems with his younger brother for a long time, and enters Saturday with a tag team win over Sikoa on SmackDown.</p>
