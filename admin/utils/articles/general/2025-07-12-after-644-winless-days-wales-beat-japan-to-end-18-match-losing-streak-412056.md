There’s some real talent as well,” Sherratt said.</p><p>“Today is the end of a long season, but for Welsh rugby it’s got to be the start of something. The next guy coming in – the big motivation for the group was to let whoever that is start on a level playing field without the burden of the 18 in a row around his neck.</p><p>“That was a big motivation for me coming in. The work’s got to be done now with the national coaches in the regions, let’s get into the regions and help develop a good young group of players.”</p><p>Sherratt had overseen four of those 18 defeats coming into Saturday’s contest and expressed his delight for Wales’ players and staff to finally earn a win as emotions ran high at full time. He added: “For me, it’s about the people. I’ve genuinely never wanted to win a game of rugby so much. I’m not around it being win or loss. I’m more around I know what the group has put in – I’ve been around for four games, but I see what it means to them, what it means to the staff.</p><p>“I was so pleased for this group, there’s not been a more deserving group that I’ve worked with, so it was pretty emotional. I had to get Gethin Jenkins to give me a slap around the face to get in check because I could have easily embarrassed myself on TV.”</p><p>Sherratt made four changes from the side <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/05/all-blacks-hold-off-depleted-france-in-thriller-and-wales-slump-again-in-japan" data-link-name="in body link">beaten by the Brave Blossoms</a> last weekend, with Freddie Thomas, Archie Griffin and Aaron Wainwright lining up alongside Edwards, who was making his first start.</p><figure id="1504660b-a324-43d2-8dad-289317ba886b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad7f8c81490500bd6490a0a543d32f37ffc0c17/1228_437_2586_2069/master/2586.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad7f8c81490500bd6490a0a543d32f37ffc0c17/1228_437_2586_2069/master/2586.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad7f8c81490500bd6490a0a543d32f37ffc0c17/1228_437_2586_2069/master/2586.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad7f8c81490500bd6490a0a543d32f37ffc0c17/1228_437_2586_2069/master/2586.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad7f8c81490500bd6490a0a543d32f37ffc0c17/1228_437_2586_2069/master/2586.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad7f8c81490500bd6490a0a543d32f37ffc0c17/1228_437_2586_2069/master/2586.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Wales players celebrate victory in in Kobe." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad7f8c81490500bd6490a0a543d32f37ffc0c17/1228_437_2586_2069/master/2586.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356.03441608662024" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Wales players celebrate victory in in Kobe.</span> Photograph: Masterpress/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Wales scored the opening try when Blair Murray squeezed through a gap and charged down the pitch before offloading to Adams to cross. Edwards added the conversion.</p><p>Japan had a great opportunity when Ichigo Nakakusu eased through the Welsh defence and looked to have played in Michael Leitch, but the flanker was hauled down as Wales recovered.</p><p>A mistake allowed Wainwright to pounce on a loose ball before launching a tidy grubber kick for Adams to chase. The winger reached the ball on the tryline but was unable to get a firm grip to ground it.</p><p>Japan earned their first points of the game from Lee’s penalty, but the visitors extended their advantage shortly afterwards from a lineout where the rolling maul reached the edge of the tryline and Hardy was able to reach over and touch down, with Edwards converting.</p><p>Faulua Makisi was sent to the sin-bin and Wales soon took advantage of their extra man when a great switch in play allowed Adams to cut in from the left and break forward before passing to Hardy, who dived over, with Edwards scoring from the tee. Japan pulled a try back just before half-time when Takeuchi surged over and Lee converted.</p><p>Wales suffered an early blow after the break when Nicky Smith was forced off through injury, to be replaced by Gareth Thomas. Although Japan started well, it was Wales who struck next as Edwards kicked a penalty. The hosts then enjoyed a superb buildup of phases which resulted in Dearns powering over and, after a television match official review, the try stood, but Lee’s conversion flew wide.</p><p>Wales suddenly found themselves in trouble as Riley latched on to a sloppy pass and sprinted up the centre of the pitch to cross underneath the posts. Lee converted to reduce the gap to two points. A cagey end to the game followed, but the visitors piled forward with five minutes to play and a quick move to the left allowed Edwards to cross before converting his own effort to wrap up the win.</p><figure id="15a4acd9-3ad7-41b3-bbb8-a951e693cf79" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7583c1a8814d718dc548da43b9fd5f4f0a54cf4c/401_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7583c1a8814d718dc548da43b9fd5f4f0a54cf4c/401_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7583c1a8814d718dc548da43b9fd5f4f0a54cf4c/401_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7583c1a8814d718dc548da43b9fd5f4f0a54cf4c/401_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7583c1a8814d718dc548da43b9fd5f4f0a54cf4c/401_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7583c1a8814d718dc548da43b9fd5f4f0a54cf4c/401_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Fiji’s Kalaveti Ravouvou takles Scotland’s Fergus Burke" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7583c1a8814d718dc548da43b9fd5f4f0a54cf4c/401_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356.0801080108011" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Fiji’s Kalaveti Ravouvou halts Scotland’s Fergus Burke in his tracks in the tourists’ bruising 29-14 defeat in Suva.</span> Photograph: Josua Buredua/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Gregor Townsend warned <strong>Scotland</strong> to clean up their act after a bruising 29-14 defeat by <strong>Fiji</strong> in Suva dented their hopes of a favourable World Cup draw.

The prop Thomas Clarkson was the only other forward to get a try as Ireland kept the ball in hand and bamboozled their hosts with some scintillating running rugby.</p></div></div>
