If anything, I think it's more experience for me on how to handle nerves. </p><p>"It's my first Slam final, so at least I have that experience now."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Anisimova left the court briefly at the end of the match before returning for the prize-giving ceremony, where she was consoled by Catherine, Princess of Wales.</p><p>Anisimova did not want to disclose the full nature of their conversation, but said the "kind words" offered by the royal helped pick her up.</p><p>"It was such an honour to meet her," Anisimova added.</p><p>"She definitely had a few things to say that were making me emotional again. She told me to keep my head high. </p><p>"She had all the best to say to me. I guess it was a positive of today and I can try and focus on that and not the match."</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Amanda Anisimova is consoled by the Princess of Wales" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/394e/live/b4e902f0-5f4f-11f0-991f-e5c488468a8c.jpg 976w" width="2560" height="1440"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Princess of Wales had "kind words" for Anisimova after a chastening afternoon</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Anisimova, who also reached the Queen's final last month, said fatigue had played a part in her performance.</p><p>She did not practise on Friday and said she felt she "had to take a break after every single rally" during her warm-up on Saturday.</p><p>"I feel like maybe the last few weeks have got to me in a way and I wasn't able to perform to my full potential," she told BBC Sport. </p><p>"But I can still walk away from today with my head high.

Wimbledon adds another 25-30% of pressure because it is Wimbledon."</p><p>Anisimova said she had never lost a match 6-0 6-0.</p><p>"For it to be in my first Grand Slam final was definitely very hard to digest, but I've been in difficult situations before in my career, and I feel like I've learned so much from those moments," she told BBC Sport.</p><p>"The only thing I told myself was to keep my head high and to keep fighting because I didn't want to let myself down at any moment."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Whats-it-like-to-be-overcome-by-nerves" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">What's it like to be overcome by nerves?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Anisimova showed nerves in some of her previous matches â€“ including her semi-final win over top seed Sabalenka - but was able to overcome them.</p><p>While Anisimova said she felt nerves before the showpiece match, she added they were not "out of this world".</p><p>But the pressure of playing in a Wimbledon final took its toll.</p><p>"She's playing in front of 15,000 people and you feel such a pressure to perform," said British former player Naomi Broady.</p><p>"People have spent so much money on their tickets and they want to see a great match and you are desperate to do so, not just for them but for yourself, your team, your family.</p><p>"She just couldn't shake the nerves, the moment became too much for her."</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
