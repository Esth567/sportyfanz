"We take these matters seriously and will learn and grow from it moving forward."</p><p>The 19-year-old's arrest on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol comes just weeks after <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/45362522/tahaad-pettiford-rejoins-auburn-eyes-higher-draft-slot-26" target="_blank">he withdrew from the NBA draft</a>. Pettiford, who averaged 11.6 PPG in his freshman season for an Auburn team that secured the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament and reached the Final Four, is the cornerstone of Auburn's next chapter after the departure of star <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433569/johni-broome" target="_blank">Johni Broome</a>.</p><p>Following his withdrawal from the draft, Pettiford said he returned to Auburn in part to prove that he can compete at the next level.</p><p>"I was happy to go through the process, getting feedback from NBA teams," Pettiford told ESPN then. "Going back to Auburn is a better situation for me. I see myself being a higher pick next year. It wasn't 100% this year, so I didn't want to take that chance."</p><p>Although he didn't receive the same buzz as some of the top freshmen in the country during the 2024-25 season, Pettiford was widely viewed as one of the best young players in the country.</p><p>He's on a short list of players who will enter the 2025-26 season as a possible preseason All-American. He averaged 15.2 PPG in five NCAA tournament games.</p><p>Before his team's run to the Final Four, Pearl praised Pettiford's humility and refusal to get upset when he had to accept less playing time on a squad full of top veterans.</p><p>"I suppose some would just sort of expect that to be a problem," Pearl said about Pettiford's situation in April. "Not a word. Not a body language, shoulder shrug, roll eye ever from Tahaad."</p>
