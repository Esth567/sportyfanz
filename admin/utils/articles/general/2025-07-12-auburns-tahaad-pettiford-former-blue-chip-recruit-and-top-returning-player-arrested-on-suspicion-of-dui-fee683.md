        <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29557851/tahaad-pettiford/">Tahaad Pettiford</a>, one of <a href="https://247sports.com/college/auburn/article/auburn-basketball-tahaad-pettiford-nba-draft-2026-251318993/" target="_blank">Auburn's top returning players</a> next season, was <a href="https://www.leecountysheriff.org/recentArrests" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">arrested Saturday on suspicion of DUI</a>. The sophomore point guard and former five-star was stopped in Lee County, Alabama, per the sheriff's office database. Bond was set at $1,000.&nbsp;</p><p>"We are aware of the situation, and we will handle internally with Tahaad and his family," Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said in a statement. "We take these matters seriously and will learn and grow from it moving forward." &nbsp;</p><p>Pettiford averaged 11.6 points per game last season as a first-year star, helping the Tigers reach the Final Four. Prior to Pettiford withdrawing his name from the 2025 <a href="https://cbssports.com/nba/draft/">NBA Draft</a> in May,&nbsp;Pearl raved about his ability and influence on the 2025-26 team if he chose to return.</p>
        

<p>"Je's going to have to play an expanded role, which I know is something that is exciting to him â€” and probably exciting to our fan base, too, because we'll get to see more of him," <a href="https://247sports.com/college/auburn/article/auburn-basketball-tahaad-pettiford-nba-draft-2025-250225478/" target="_blank">Pearl said, via Auburn Undercover</a>. "He'll be a starter. There will be more on him."</p><p>According to CBS Sports' Matt Norlander, Pettiford "<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/tahaad-pettiford-withdraws-from-nba-draft-sophomore-guard-returns-to-auburn-after-final-four-season/" target="_blank">had a robust NIL package awaiting back at Auburn</a></span>" on a deal believed to be worth more than $2 million. He returned to the Plains this summer after failing to get a first-round grade following his performance at the NBA Combine.</p>
        

<p>With heavy personnel losses coming off the fantastic season, Auburn has added several transfers to bolster the roster around Pettiford, including forward <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28955426/keyshawn-hall/">Keyshawn Hall</a>&nbsp;(UCF), big man <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/26808223/keshawn-murphy/">KeShawn Murphy</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/">Mississippi State</a>), guard&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29232402/kevin-overton/">Kevin Overton</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/">Texas Tech</a>) and wing Elyjah Freeman (Lincoln Memorial). JUCO pickups Abdul Bashir and center Emeka Opurum will help, too.&nbsp;</p>
