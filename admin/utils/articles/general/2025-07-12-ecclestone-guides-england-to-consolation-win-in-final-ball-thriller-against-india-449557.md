For Verma, it was a welcome comeback: her first international half-century since being dropped by India last year, struck so imperiously that in a 66-run partnership with captain Harmanpreet Kaur, the latter contributed just 15 runs.</p><p>England were grateful to have Maia Bouchier back in the fold, despite the fact that she contributed just 16 runs at No 3: she has always been one of their best outfielders, and showed it here, clasping on to a brilliant running catch at wide long-on to see off Verma in the 13th over. She held on to another in the 19th which got rid of the aggressive Richa Ghosh.</p><p>But Bouchier’s inclusion came at the expense of Alice Capsey, who now faces an uncertain path back to the England T20 side before next summer’s World Cup. England now have no official T20 internationals in the calendar until May next year – a feat of scheduling which seems both bizarre and counterproductive, given the yawning gap between their current output and their desire to feature in a home final at Lord’s next July.</p></div></div>
