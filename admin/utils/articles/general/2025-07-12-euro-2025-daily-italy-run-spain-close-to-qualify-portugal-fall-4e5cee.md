They had just been beaten 3-1 by Group B winners Spain, but minds were on events in Sion, where <a data-clubhouse-guid="f1a6de89-2405-3d20-9670-e5136704a849" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=9531">Portugal</a> were playing <a data-clubhouse-guid="5e3e3e5d-b558-35d7-a2db-31a927200984" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=18736">Belgium</a>.</p><p>The phones came out just in time to see Belgium net a late winner, guaranteeing Italy's passage to a quarterfinal against <a data-clubhouse-guid="b6971873-a34b-d747-24f8-b6f76ebcac9a" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2762">Norway</a>. In truth, it had never been in doubt. Only a Portugal win, an Italy defeat and a six-goal swing would have knocked the <em>Azzurre </em>out. That scenario never looked likely at any point of the night.</p><p>On another night, Andrea Soncin's side might even have booked their knockout spot without needing to worry about Portugal's result. With what seemed like around 75% of the 30,000 crowd supporting the Italians, they made a fast start in Bern. Early chances had already come and gone, the woodwork rocked, when <a data-player-guid="f5905ec4-4244-392d-b184-973c0aa0c07d" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/380833/elisabetta-oliviero">Elisabetta Oliviero</a> fired them into a 10th-minute lead.</p><p>Spain quickly equalized through <a data-player-guid="637e6b5f-6841-399d-ac28-382e6e7a3bc4" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/320355/athenea-del-castillo">Athenea del Castillo</a>, the half ending level, but both teams squandered chances to lead by the break. Italy actually led 1.19-0.40 on xG (expected goals) when the halftime whistle sounded. Spain clicked through a few gears in the second half and deservedly won the game, but Italy will feel they showed more than enough to be confident of troubling Norway in the quarterfinal in Geneva on Wednesday.</p><p>Neither team would have been fancied to reach the semifinal, but one of them will be there.

Their neighbors did their part of the job, beating the <em>Azzurre </em>3-1. On the other hand, however, Portugal could not do theirs, not even close.</p><p>Worse, they finish bottom of their group: Three games, zero wins, one draw and two losses, including the one on Friday evening against Belgium. This is a terrible outcome for <a data-player-guid="3883323e-9dd2-3a88-940f-cca2968eb7cb" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/320145/kika-nazareth">Kika Nazareth</a> and her teammates, as their ambition before the tournament started was to reach the last eight at least. But they never looked like they could get there.</p><p>Destroyed by Spain to start the competition after the shock of the tragic death of Diogo Jota and his brother, a point against Italy was not enough and finally a poor performance against Belgium saw them concede very early, again.</p><p>For Neto, who celebrates his 44th birthday today and who has done so much for the women's game in Portugal, it is a huge failure. One that he might not come back from. -- <em>Julien Laurens</em></p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45711918" data-cerebro-id="68702e69ac2b6424ea6294ca" data-title="How Switzerland saved their Euro 2025 hopes" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45711918">play</span><figcaption><p>0:52</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>How Switzerland saved their Euro 2025 hopes</p><p>Take a look at the numbers behind Switzerland's 1-1 draw against Finland to secure their spot in the Euro 2025 quarterfinals at their home tournament.</p></div></div><h3>Switzerland celebrates</h3><p>Zurich erupted when Switzerland's <a data-player-guid="23ec95a7-a96c-3619-b41c-29212b14782c" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/309080/riola-xhemaili">Riola Xhemaili</a> scored a last-minute equalizer against <a data-clubhouse-guid="9e6c626c-407d-3cbb-bd4b-e100b7c1c33f" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=7536">Finland</a>, sending the hosts to the quarterfinals for the very first time.</p><p>Though the match itself took place over 250km away in Geneva, celebrations in Zurich's fan zone were electric.

<p>In the stadium, both players and fans were visibly moved by the scale of the achievement.

"When you talk about dancing and singing and so on, I do believe it's all about the journey.
