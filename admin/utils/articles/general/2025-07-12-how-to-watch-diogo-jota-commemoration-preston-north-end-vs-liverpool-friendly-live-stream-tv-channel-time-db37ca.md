<p>Preseason play kicks off for <span>Liverpool</span> on Sunday, but it's quite hard to focus on soccer on the pitch following the <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/diogo-jota-liverpool-and-portugal-player-dies-in-car-accident-in-spain-at-age-28/" target="_blank">tragic death of forward Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva in a car accident</a></span>. Upon returning to training, players have been emotional following the loss of their friend and teammate, as Diogo Jota has had a massive impact on Liverpool as a club. But the season must still go on, and the Reds will begin in an away trip to face Preston North End before heading to Hong Kong to play Milan.</p><p>Despite the match not taking place at Anfield, Liverpool will have numerous tributes to Diogo Jota and Andre Silva ahead and during the friendly, while both teams will also wear black armbands during the match. The pre-match tributes will be broadcast on YouTube ahead of the match, which will be available on the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e" target="_blank">CBS Sports Golazo Network</a>.</p><p>Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:</p><h2>How to watch Preston vs. Liverpool</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: Sunday, July 13 |&nbsp;<strong>Time</strong>: 9:45&nbsp;a.m. ET</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Deepdale -- Preston, England</li><li><strong>Pregame coverage:</strong> LFCTV and Liverpool YouTube</li><li><strong>Match live stream:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e" target="_blank">CBS Sports Golazo Network</a></li></ul><h2>Planned tributes</h2><p>Ahead of kickoff, there will be a performance of <em>You'll Never Walk Alone</em>, the Liverpool anthem, while the club will lay a wreath. There will also be a minute long moment of silence while tributes will be displayed on the screens at the stadium. Preston has also created a commemorative matchday program for the occasion. Liverpool have also announced that Diogo Jota's number 20 jersey will be retired across all levels of the club in his honor.</p><h2>New Debuts incoming</h2><p>With the additions of <span>Florian Wirtz</span> and <span>Jeremie Frimpong</span> from <span>Bayer Leverkusen</span>, there have been some shifts in the Liverpool squad, and the duo could be set to make their debuts in this match. Wirtz has a record price tag to live up to, while Frimpong will replace a key cog in the Liverpool lineup with <span>Trent Alexander-Arnold's</span> departure for <span>Real Madrid</span>. Milos Kerkez could also make his Liverpool debut after joining from Bournemouth. Andrew Robertson is still with the club, but with so many games taking part in the Champions League, Arne Slot will need all of the depth that he can get.</p><h2>Prediction</h2><p>Even with the emotion over the day, Liverpool's depth will help start the preseason off on the right foot with a victory in their first preseason match. Wirtz will also get his first Liverpool goal to start living up to his record price tag right out of the gate.&nbsp;<strong>Pick: </strong>Preston 0, Liverpool 4</p><h2>Get your footy fix with CBS Sports Golazo Network and more</h2><p>‚òÄÔ∏è&nbsp;<strong>Morning Footy</strong>&nbsp;(Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Join Golazo Network as it helps fans get their day started on the right foot on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e" target="_blank">network's flagship morning show</a>&nbsp;with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/morning-footy-a-daily-soccer-podcast-from-cbs/id1694386891" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Morning Footy is also available in podcast form</a>, so you'll never have to miss an episode.</p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp;<strong>Attacking Third</strong>&nbsp;(Monday, Thursday): The leading <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/attacking-third-a-cbs-sports-womens-soccer-podcast/id1573642138" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">women's soccer podcast</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/attacking-third" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social brand</a> is now a live studio <span>show</span>.
