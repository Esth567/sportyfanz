The American said her slam final debut was undone by nerves and a “mediocre serve” that had dogged her fortnight. The title will propel Swiatek to No 3 in the WTA rankings and signals a major breakthrough in her 2025 season. At the French Open, Swiatek – nicknamed the Queen of Clay – fell in the semi-finals to Aryna Sabalenka, marking the first time she failed to reach the final at Roland Garros since 2021.
