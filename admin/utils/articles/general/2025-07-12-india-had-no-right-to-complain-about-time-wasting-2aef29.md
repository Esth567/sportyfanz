Crawley responded by waving a finger at Gill. Duckett then stepped in to respond to Gill's words.</p></li><li><p>Crawley missed the final delivery and immediately turned to the dressing room. More words were sent in the direction of Duckett as he and India's fielders left the field.</p></li></ul></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="We-were-hoping-we-could-get-a-wicket" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'We were hoping we could get a wicket'</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>"Obviously we wanted to bowl two overs," India batter KL Rahul said.</p><p>"There were six minutes left.
