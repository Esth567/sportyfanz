Last year, at the Olympic Games in Paris, games during the day, in all sports, took place in very hot conditions.</p><p>"Cooling breaks are very important and we will see what we can do, but we have stadiums with roofs and we will definitely use these stadiums during the day next year."</p><p>Infantino and FIFA have been criticised by players and coaches for the decision to stage a 32-team summer Club World Cup.</p><p>But the FIFA president defended the tournament and said some European teams who failed to qualify asked to be invited.</p><p>"I've been speaking to teams from Europe who came here and all have been very happy," he said.

For now, we go ahead again with this in 2029 and we will see.</p><p>"I respect everyone and every opinion of everyone. I had my own opinion before the tournament and this opinion has become even stronger now.</p><p>"It has been a huge, huge, huge success and the golden era of football has started."</p><p>Infantino, who was speaking at Trump Tower in Manhattan, confirmed that <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45696463/trump-attend-club-world-cup-final-metlife-stadium" target="_blank">President Donald Trump will attend the final</a> in New Jersey on Sunday.</p><p>"President Trump will be at the final," he said. "He loves soccer. In his first term as president there was a soccer goal in the White House garden.</p><p>"President Trump is the president of the U.S., one of the host countries for the World Cup, and he embraced immediately the Club World Cup as well.</p><p>"Events like these are huge events. You can't stage tournaments like this without his support."</p>
