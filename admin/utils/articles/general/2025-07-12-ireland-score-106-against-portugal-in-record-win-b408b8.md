their record Test victory with a 106-7 win in their first ever capped international against Portugal at the Estadio Nacional do Jamor.</b></p><p>The side ranked third in the world, whose previous biggest win was an 83-3 victory over the USA in June 2000, set new marks for points, tries and winning margin. </p><p>Without their large British and Irish Lions contingent, Ireland's interim head coach Paul O'Connell gave debuts to Alex Kendellen, Hugh Gavin and Shayne Bolton with the latter pair each crossing twice among the visitor's eight first-half tries.</p><p>Kendellen would then mark his own Test bow with one of the eight Ireland scored after the turn. </p><p>Portugal got their only score through flanker Nicholas Martins in the second half, although they did have an earlier try chalked off by the television match official (TMO) before communication between the referee and his off-field assistant failed meaning there were no replay reviews in place for the final hour.</p><p>After last week's win over Georgia, Ireland finished their two-Test summer tour with a pair of wins and will next be in action when they meet New Zealand in Chicago on 1 November.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source

data-component="text-block"><p>Portugal impressed at the 2023 World Cup when they beat Fiji and drew with Georgia in their first time at the tournament since 2007.</p><p>This version of Os Lobos, however, finished only fourth in Rugby Europe after defeats to Spain and Romania and never looked competitive against superior opposition. </p><p>Despite being without 17 players who are on Lions duty, as well as their head coach Andy Farrell who is leading the tourists in Australia, Ireland dominated from start to finish.</p><p>They took the lead with less than a minute on the clock when Stuart McCloskey crashed over from close range after some neat involvements from Jack Crowley.</p><p>As well as debutants Bolton and Gavin, Tommy O'Brien, who scored a pair of tries during his own debut against Georgia last week, also scored twice in the first half with tight-head Tom Clarkson the other player to go over. </p><p>The loss of the TMO, in a game played in front of fewer than 10,000 supporters, came only after Portugal had a score chalked off when Vincent Pinto's pass to Nuno Guedes was judged to have gone forward.</p><p>A difficult half for the hosts was made all the tougher when they lost both captain Tomas Appleton and his replacement Gabriel Avriagnet to injury, forcing back row Francisco Almeida into a role on the wing after only two backs were named on the bench.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/4c1c/live/be5d3ed0-5f5b-11f0-b9de-abcfc8907095.jpg.webp

hour to go, while Martins' response at least showed what Portugal are capable of with ball in hand.</p><p>It proved only a temporary slowing of Irish momentum, however. </p><p>Replacements Calvin Nash
