Dobbins was diagnosed with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, his second ACL tear in his right knee.</p><p>"Yeah. I've torn my ACL in this knee before, and it was the same feeling," he said, standing in the middle of Boston's clubhouse with a red sleeve on his right leg. "Kind of some denial went into it, tried to go through that warmup pitch, felt the same sensation again, so, at that point, I knew what it was."</p><p>Dobbins tore the same ACL playing high school football.</p><p>Covering first base in the second inning of Boston's <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/recap/_/gameId/401696317" target="_blank">5-4 walk-off win</a> over the <a data-clubhouse-guid="f8a579c6-08b9-7584-141d-317d0645763b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a> on Friday night, 25-year-old Dobbins stepped awkwardly and limped after recording an out by making a catch on a throw from first baseman <a data-player-guid="1ab282fd-0698-41d7-35a0-be879e8a676a" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40754/abraham-toro">Abraham Toro</a>.</p><p>Dobbins took one warmup toss before manager Alex Cora stopped him from attempting any more.</p><p>"Tough," Cora said before the Red Sox faced the Rays. "He put himself on the map, right, did a good job for us. When it happened, I thought something minor. Talking to him, he felt it right away. He's been through that before."</p><p>Dobbins said he found out about Boston's dramatic win while being examined.</p><p>"I was actually in the MRI machine and they were giving me score updates in between each one," he said. "Right after the last one they said, 'I think you'd like to hear this, you just won by a walk-off.' That was pretty cool to hear the guys picked me up."</p><p>The Red Sox placed him on the 15-day injured list Saturday and recalled right-hander <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4414243/richard-fitts">Richard Fitts</a>.</p><p>"In my head I have Opening Day next year kind of circled," Dobbins said. "Whether or not that's realistic, I don't know, but that's my goal."</p>
