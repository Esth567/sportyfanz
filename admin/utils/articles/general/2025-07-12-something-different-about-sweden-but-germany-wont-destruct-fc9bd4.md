"We always want to do better.</p><p>"We know we have been doing good in tournaments before, but we also know we haven't gone the whole way.</p><p>"I have a really good feeling. You can see that in the squad there is something different this year and we always believe.</p><p>"We want to reach the final and with that being said we need to take every game for what it is. We can't look too much ahead. It's going to be a challenge but we are ready."</p><p>While they turned in an impressive display for a first success in seven meetings against Germany at a Euros, Sweden were also lifted to victory by a sea of 2,500 supporters in blue and yellow, who did not stop singing throughout.</p><p>The players celebrated and danced to music with their fans afterwards, which was a special moment for Rytting Kaneryd.</p><p>"I couldn't dream about more," said the 28-year-old. "This is incredible. I can't really explain the feeling.</p><p>"After the game you see all those yellow shirts, so many. We never thought it would be as big as it is. It's a really good sign that we have the support from Sweden."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="If-we-meet-England-we-are-going-to-write-a-better-history" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'If we meet England, we are going to write a better history'</span></h2></p><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Sweden celebrate with supporter" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/56d2/live/99a516e0-5f6e-11f0-94bd-c535eca409cb.jpg 976w" width="2560" height="1439.5733333333333"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Gerhardsson has been in charge of Sweden since 2017 but is set to step down after Euro 2025.</p><p>As winners of Group C, his side will face the runner-up of Group D and will know their quarter-final opponents after the conclusion of England's tie with Wales and Netherlands against France on Sunday (both 20:00 BST kick-offs).</p><p>The 65-year-old led Sweden to the semi-finals of Euro 2022, where they were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62286243">beaten 4-0</a> by eventual winners England.</p><p>While Gerhardsson said he is "not a dreamer", if he is to bow out with one last hurrah in Switzerland, his side will exact revenge if they land England in the last eight.</p><p>"That was a special game," he recalled of their previous encounter at Bramall Lane.

Now we have to analyse that with the players.</p><p>"We will shake that off and be very happy to play the quarter-finals whoever that is, the English, the French or whatever.</p><p>"It would be wrong now to say we want to react and destruct.
