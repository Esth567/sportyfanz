<strong>2023 draft: Round 1, No. 15</strong></p><p>This is an important year for Bufkin, who is nearly seven months removed from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/43045753/hawks-okongwu-least-4-games-bufkin-season-over">season-ending shoulder surgery</a> going into his third NBA season. The guard out of Michigan entered the league in 2023 with real promise, but he has appeared in just 27 regular-season games. The 21-year-old has a key window to solidify himself as part of Atlanta's future, with the Hawks retooling, and led by a new front office that didn't draft him. Bufkin will be under the microscope as he returns to action. -- <em>Woo</em></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/bos.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="2ca761df-5f60-b2e9-22ed-e099c46d889b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a></h2><p><strong><a data-player-guid="4a8dc4b2-ce99-3be8-a7db-2d20e3f285d6" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5175647/hugo-gonzalez">Hugo Gonzalez</a> | SG</strong><br>
<strong>2025 draft: Round 1, No. 28</strong></p><p>Gonzalez is walking into a good situation in Boston as the team's lone first-round pick in a year when there will be plenty of vacant wing minutes. After he averaged 10 minutes per game at Real Madrid last season, the NBA will now get a much longer look at the 19-year-old, who is known for his motor and should enter a much better opportunity to play and develop. We'll see how Gonzalez fares when the training wheels come off, but he could develop into an important role player for the Celtics in time. -- <em>Woo</em></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/bkn.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets</a></h2><p><strong><a data-player-guid="fb0aca8f-4878-3010-abe0-05b507191367" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5175643/egor-demin">Egor Demin</a> | PG</strong><br>
<strong>2025 draft: Round 1, No. 8</strong></p><p>The headliner of the Nets' five-man draft class, Demin will be the most intriguing in his new situation, with Brooklyn presumably planning to coax as much as they can out of him as an on-ball playmaker. Expect him to rotate those reps with the Nets' other rookies, but Demin's passing vision should shine in what's typically a wide-open on-court environment in Vegas. I'm curious how he'll look in this context, and I'd love to see Demin play in creative pick-and-roll with fellow Nets draft classmate <a data-player-guid="ac3b948f-3ad6-335a-9ac2-8c7c166b0ba4" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5107173/danny-wolf">Danny Wolf</a>. -- Woo</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/cha.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="377633c2-0dd1-91a1-83c0-9ed2d0c00ea1" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets">Charlotte Hornets</a></h2><p><b><a data-player-guid="d706a855-1bca-34f6-9dd7-6684dd22c3ee" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5061575/kon-knueppel">Kon Knueppel</a> | SF</b><br>
<strong>2025 draft: Round 1, No. 4</strong></p><p>Knueppel presumably will be the focal point of the Hornets' Las Vegas operation, giving him an opportunity to showcase his excellent shooting (64.8 true shooting percentage at Duke) and the breadth of his ability as a secondary playmaker. He figures to be one of the most advanced rookies out of the gate, and this should be a nice platform for him to get up plenty of shots. -- <em>Woo</em></p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45585623" data-cerebro-id="6850ab54f6080558e9d987f4" data-title="Kon Knueppel's top plays that led him to the Hornets" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0616%2Fdm_250616_kon_knueppel_profile%2Fdm_250616_kon_knueppel_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0616%2Fdm_250616_kon_knueppel_profile%2Fdm_250616_kon_knueppel_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0616%2Fdm_250616_kon_knueppel_profile%2Fdm_250616_kon_knueppel_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45585623">play</span><figcaption><p>1:23</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Kon Knueppel's top plays that led him to the Hornets</p><p>Check out some of Kon Knueppel's top plays at Duke as he heads to the Hornets with the fourth overall pick.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/chi.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="e588ccf1-ba03-ea43-c34c-9a9c8d1895ca" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls">Chicago Bulls</a></h2><p><b><a data-player-guid="383a14a9-1113-3728-8e79-ca9d653735fc" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4711294/matas-buzelis">Matas Buzelis</a> | SF</b><br>
<strong>2024 draft: Round 1, No. 11</strong></p><p>Buzelis presumably won't play more than a game or two in Las Vegas, but his second-half emergence (13 points on 46% field goal/36% 3-pointers/83% free throw splits post All-Star) was a huge development for the Bulls, who are set to increasingly lean on him over the next few seasons. He should have plenty of opportunities to score on a summer league roster that's more or less built around him. I'm also quite curious about 2025 No. 12 overall pick <a data-player-guid="13c2a19f-d803-32b5-a344-cf07dc594665" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5242496/noa-essengue">Noa Essengue</a>, who gives Chicago a second big, versatile forward to build around. -- <em>Woo</em></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/cle.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="ec79ad1f-e6d2-7762-a2db-7fe97d35126b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers">Cleveland Cavaliers</a></h2><p><b><a data-player-guid="87a434d3-6801-3fa7-975f-e4731e3739be" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683747/jaylon-tyson">Jaylon Tyson</a> | SG</b><br>
<strong>2024 draft: Round 1, No. 20</strong></p><p>The Cavaliers only made two second-round selections this year, meaning last year's 20th overall pick (Tyson)  is the headliner of their summer league group. He was called upon sparingly on a very good Cleveland team in 2024-25, but he could be ticketed for more of a role next season after the Cavs traded <a data-player-guid="7bcc7c59-2e9a-3729-b929-9f3c20682cd8" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432822/isaac-okoro">Isaac Okoro</a> to the Bulls for <a data-player-guid="63605956-6a4c-d187-5e83-4f0e5c740a28" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066421/lonzo-ball">Lonzo Ball</a>.

"Being able to run the show, being able to play the 2, play the 3." A power forward at Duke, Flagg will have to play the perimeter in the NBA because of the Mavericks' crowded frontcourt.

Both turnovers (4.7 per game) and fouls (4.0 per game in 20.9 minutes) were an issue for Yang, and we'll be watching how much he has improved in between summer league outings. -- <em>Pelton</em></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/sac.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="e266c4ea-9af3-1bd8-06fb-fd608fd30e26" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings">Sacramento Kings</a></h2><p><b><a data-player-guid="3da4dcbe-ff57-3082-a02a-48ec86e1ba8b" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4702384/nique-clifford">Nique Clifford</a> | SG</b><br>
<strong>2025 draft: Round 1, No. 24</strong></p><p>Clifford is quite familiar with the Thomas &amp; Mack Center court, having played against UNLV in the college basketball regular season, and averaged 25.0 PPG, 10.3 RPG and 4.3 APG there as Colorado State won the Mountain West title at the conference tournament in March. Those performances helped solidify Clifford as a first-round pick by the Kings. -- <em>Pelton</em></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/sas.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="8aef8547-32f5-0943-a1de-e734567674cc" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a></h2><p><b><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5037871/dylan-harper">Dylan Harper</a> | SG</b><br>
<strong>2025 draft: Round 1, No. 2</strong></p><p>Let's hope we'll see the No. 2 pick in Las Vegas after he missed the California Classic due to what San Antonio summer coach Mike Noyes termed a "minor" groin injury. Harper would get the keys to the Spurs' offense this summer in a way that won't be possible during the regular season, when he suits up alongside <a data-player-guid="5f18d1cf-1c2e-3601-a04e-1a3fc84d8ef1" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066259/deaaron-fox">De'Aaron Fox</a> and reigning NBA Rookie of the Year <a data-player-guid="26c7892b-12d0-3b1d-9645-f881921a1a20" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4845367/stephon-castle">Stephon Castle</a>.

<strong>2025 draft: Round 1, No. 9</strong></p><p>Murray-Boyles was a polarizing player in the scouting community over the past year, offering quite a bit of production and obvious smarts and defensive versatility. But he was also lacking a reliable jumper with average size for a four-man -- and doing it in a losing context at South Carolina. How he takes to what should be a more conducive team construct should be fun to see in Vegas, as well as how the Raptors decide to use him on the offensive end: How much they look to play through him as a passer and whether he's confident taking 3s are two things to watch for. -- <em>Woo</em></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/uth.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="77cea2fb-1388-b7c8-d171-2e72b3aecbfb" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/utah/utah-jazz">Utah Jazz</a></h2><p><b><a data-player-guid="51ddca1a-e632-38f9-a875-b8858a2884de" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4873138/ace-bailey">Ace Bailey</a> | SF</b><br>
<strong>2025 draft: Round 1, No. 5</strong></p><p>After generating lots of discussion leading up to the draft because of his decision not to work out for any team, Bailey landed in Utah without incident. Now we will start to see whether Bailey merited all the attention after a season at Rutgers, where he showed great strengths in shotmaking and rim protection for his size, but poor shot selection and playmaking for teammates. His debut, in which Bailey shot 1-of-5 on non-paint 2-pointers, wasn't encouraging in that regard. -- <em>Pelton</em></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/was.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="64d73af6-b8ec-e213-87e8-a4eab3a692e7" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/wsh/washington-wizards">Washington Wizards</a></h2><p><b><a data-player-guid="432b4847-f726-3711-898d-9e507c8f5bf2" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5238230/tre-johnson">Tre Johnson</a> | SG</b><br>
<strong>2025 draft: Round 1, No. 6</strong></p><p>Johnson figures to fill up the box score in summer league as one of the draft's more polished perimeter scorers and a potential centerpiece of the Wizards' developing roster. The element of his game to monitor will be his playmaking; he's likely to draw plenty of attention from defenses, but making the right decisions and becoming a more willing passer are the next steps in his growth. Washington has the most loaded roster in Vegas, featuring five first-round picks from 2024 in addition to Johnson and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5144126/will-riley">Will Riley</a>, but Johnson figures to have a featured place in the Wizards' offense, both this week and come fall. -- <em>Woo</em></p>
