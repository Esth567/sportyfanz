        <p>The <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/">Kansas City Chiefs</a>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chiefs-bid-at-historic-three-peat-ends-miserably-in-super-bowl-lix-three-things-that-went-wrong-for-k-c/" target="_blank">three-peat attempt fell well short of history in Super Bowl LIX</a></span>. But don't expect the reigning AFC champions to fall back in the coming years, according to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/396886/tony-romo/">Tony Romo</a>. Romo suggests plenty of reason for belief in Kansas City's postseason dominance, starting first with three-time league MVP and title winner <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/">Patrick Mahomes</a>.</p><p>"They've been saying that for years," Romo said Saturday at the American Century Championship. "They said that about (Tom) Brady and the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> and (Bill) Belichick. It's the same thing. You got Andy Reid, you got Mahomes, you got (Travis) Kelce. You guys are going to be fine."</p><p>Labels strengthened following February's blowout loss to the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. The Eagles blanked Mahomes and the Chiefs in the first half and <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/super-bowl-2025-chiefs-patrick-mahomes-travis-kelce-try-to-make-sense-of-shocking-blowout-loss-to-eagles/" target="_blank">fell behind by as many as 34 points in the third quarter</a></span>, the largest deficit of the former first-round pick's career.</p><p>Mahomes committed three turnovers and suffered a career-high six sacks during a frustrating effort.</p>
        


<p>After pumping the breaks on the idea of Kansas City's dynasty coming to a close, Romo was asked to comment on <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/493043/ben-roethlisbergers/">Ben Roethlisberger's</a> <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ben-roethlisberger-says-hed-take-prime-aaron-rodgers-over-patrick-mahomes-is-he-right-a-breakdown/" target="_blank">recent opinion that a "prime" Aaron Rodgers was better than Mahomes</a></span>.</p><p>Again, the former <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/">Dallas Cowboys</a> star refused to speak negatively about Mahomes.</p><p>"I don't get into hypotheticals and stuff, but I think they're both incredible quarterbacks, both with rare traits," Romo said.</p>
        

<p><span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2025-nfl-free-agency-chiefs-re-signing-running-back-kareem-hunt-to-one-year-deal-per-report/" target="_blank">Kansas City re-signed offensive weapons</a></span> <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804128/marquise-brown/">Marquise Brown</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079567/kareem-hunt/">Kareem Hunt</a> this offseason, along with linebacker <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965817/nick-bolton/">Nick Bolton</a> among others. Offensive line additions through free agency and the 2025 <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/">NFL Draft</a> are expected to help as well.</p>
