He joins Leverkusen as one of the first signings for new boss Erik ten Hag, who took over from Xabi Alonso this summer.</p><p>"I'm happy, I'm excited; I think it's a good step for my career," Tillman told ESPN.</p><p>When asked if he has mixed feelings about leaving PSV, Tillman said: "I definitely do. But it's football. Sometimes you have to move on. I'm going to miss it here. I had two great seasons here. I miss the players, the coaches, the people at the club. But I'm also excited to have some new experiences in my life. So yes, mixed feelings."</p><p>Tillman, who said he spoke to Ten Hag ahead of the transfer, added: "It's been a good step for my career [playing for PSV]. Obviously we've won two titles, and played good in the Champions League. A great step for my career. I developed as a player and a person. I can't be grateful enough to play for PSV, in front of those fans."</p><p>His arrival at Leverkusen follows the exit of the team's star attacker, <a data-player-guid="6fb5c533-f861-37b8-8315-0d57da82124f" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/303748/florian-wirtz">Florian Wirtz</a>, who joined <a data-clubhouse-guid="a47fbcec-c948-cf4c-9e41-3dfa37588c9c" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=364">Liverpool</a> on June 20.</p><p>Tillman has signed a five-year contract with the <a data-league-guid="30244926-00c4-3f69-8946-f8421c97ff71" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/GER.1">Bundesliga</a> club.</p><p>"We've gained another strong and very dangerous attacking player," Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes said. "He can play in both the No. 10 and the No. 8 positions in midfield. Malik is an absolute top signing for us."</p><p>Tillman, who was born in Nuremberg, Germany, to a German mother and American father, played through <a data-clubhouse-guid="25b5e432-d3d2-939f-f73b-6e531a6fbd91" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=132">Bayern Munich</a>'s youth teams after switching from Bavarian rival SpVgg Greuther FÃ¼rth in 2015.</p><p>He was unable to establish himself in the senior team and made just seven appearances for Bayern before joining Scottish giants Rangers on loan in 2022-23. He joined PSV on loan with an option to make the move permanent the next season. PSV activated the permanent option last year.</p><p>Tillman scored 16 goals and set up five more in 34 competitive games for PSV last season.</p><p>He has 25 international caps for the U.S., with six coming at this summer's <a data-league-guid="64cf0d9a-e3a9-33b1-a6ad-64639a8bb51d" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/CONCACAF.GOLD">Gold Cup</a>.</p><p><em>Information from the Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>
