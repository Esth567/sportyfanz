And that means every top-10 ranking has at least one player who fell from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/40283991/top-10-nfl-players-every-position-2024-jeremy-fowler-best-quarterbacks-running-backs-wide-receivers">last year's charts</a>,  whether because of performance, injury or the strength of the rankings. We'll collect those names here as the top 10 for each position is unveiled.</p><p>A reminder of the rankings process: League executives, coaches and scouts gave us their best 10 players at a position; then we compiled the results and ranked candidates based on number of top-10 votes, composite average and dozens of interviews, with research and film study help from ESPN NFL analyst Matt Bowen. More than 70 voters submitted a ballot on at least one position, and in many cases, all positions. Additional voting and follow-up calls with those surveyed helped break ties.</p><p>We will roll out a position per day over 11 days.

Ranked 29th in the league in rushing a year ago, Cleveland is expected to show greater commitment to the run in 2025, which could play to the five-time All-Pro Bitonio's strengths and possibly land him back on this list next season, when he'll be 34.</p><p><i>Note: The Cowboys' Zack Martin (No. 1 in last season's rankings) and Lions' Frank Ragnow (No. 8) both retired during the 2025 offseason.</i></p><p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45530903/top-10-nfl-interior-offensive-linemen-execs-scouts-2025-espn-jeremy-fowler-position-rankings"><strong>See who made the 2025 top 10 »</strong></a></p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png" width="100%"></p><h2>Tight ends</h2><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4385690.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="d4652b30-6ba5-b261-e946-eb83b36a9b88" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4385690/dalton-kincaid">Dalton Kincaid</a>, Bills </b>(No. 8 in 2024 preseason) -- Like many on this list, Kincaid's 2024 drop-off had a lot to do with injuries, as Kincaid dealt with issues in both knees as well as a collarbone injury that he played through. While still ranking second on the Bills in targets (75) -- not an insignificant detail in a season when his quarterback won the MVP award -- Kincaid went from 73 catches to 44, and 673 yards to 448 in a season when he missed four games. The 25-year-old is a bounce-back candidate in 2025.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3051876.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="9e0efe52-174f-d361-6d08-4886592d9038" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051876/evan-engram">Evan Engram</a>, Broncos </b>(No. 9 in 2024 preseason) -- Engram was due some regression after his career-best 114-catch season with Jacksonville in 2023, and the injuries that were a theme of his time with the Giants (2017-21) resurfaced. Engram missed eight games with a hamstring injury and a torn labrum, and was released by the Jags after accumulating a career-low 365 yards on 47 catches. The 30-year-old Engram was inked to a two-year, $23 million deal by Denver in March.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3117256.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="6713c2d0-5594-f7b2-a1bc-f2a53b907fc0" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117256/dalton-schultz">Dalton Schultz</a>, Texans </b>(No. 10 in 2024 preseason) -- Schultz had a solid 2024 in which his numbers (53 receptions, 532 yards, 2 TD) were only slightly below his standard career production, but he fell off a Top 10 list that had to make way for names such as <a data-player-guid="bc4ba7ee-446b-36fd-9985-7fd2a94a98bc" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432665/brock-bowers">Brock Bowers</a>, <a data-player-guid="bd8caf85-18e8-478a-ff01-42ac1225ccff" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361307/trey-mcbride">Trey McBride</a> and <a data-player-guid="b36df804-8242-754d-43b1-9dec06fafcaf" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361050/isaiah-likely">Isaiah Likely</a>.

The Giants, who awarded the 25-year-old free agent a three-year, $45.5 million contract, are banking on Holland returning to the form that put him in the top half of these rankings a season ago.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4401811.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="43c92111-cea3-95ca-e8dd-e53a8904a622" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4401811/kyle-dugger">Kyle Dugger</a>, Patriots</b> (No. 8 in 2024 preseason) -- Dugger struggled to live up to the four-year, $58 million contract extension he signed last April, batting a high ankle sprain in Week 4 that sidelined him for four games and visibly limited him upon his return. If healthy, the 29-year-old Dugger has a chance for a resurgence under first-year coach Mike Vrabel.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4360853.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="379f2aa6-c5f8-b840-c0e3-e7f8ef5a8d2b" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360853/talanoa-hufanga">Talanoa Hufanga</a>, Broncos</b> (No. 9 in 2024 preseason) -- Hufanga was one of several key members of the 2024 49ers to have his season limited by injuries, missing 10 games due to knee, ankle and wrist problems. The 2022 first-team All-Pro has missed major portions of the past two seasons -- a torn right ACL cost him the final 10 games of the 2023 season in San Francisco. Hufanga signed a three-year, $45 million contract with Denver in March.</p><p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45530861/top-10-nfl-safeties-execs-scouts-2025-espn-jeremy-fowler-position-rankings"><strong>See who made the 2025 top 10 »</strong></a></p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png" width="100%"></p><h2>Edge</h2><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3915239.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="b4b45558-b798-eb94-942b-9603e34c6b39" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915239/josh-hines-allen">Josh Hines-Allen</a>, Jaguars</b> (No. 8 in 2024 preseason) -- Hines-Allen didn't approach the production of his 17.5-sack season of 2023, but he did log eight sacks, second on the team in 2024 behind <a data-player-guid="5431a37e-7b11-f9fb-a12b-68627e0eb858" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426349/travon-walker">Travon Walker</a>'s 10.5.

It was a disappointing turn for a player who signed a four-year, $110 million deal with the Raiders in March 2024.

The 27-year-old Brown participated in walk-throughs during 2025 minicamps but has not been cleared to return.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3122752.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false"></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="99fef066-3b7b-f035-c202-879446d10d7c" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122752/kenny-clark">Kenny Clark</a>, Packers</b> (No. 9 in 2024 preseason) -- The durable Clark started all 17 games for the third straight season but was unable to build on a strong statistical 2023 that saw him record a career 7.5 sacks and reach his third Pro Bowl. Clark told reporters in June that he played the entire 2024 season through a foot injury sustained Week 1 in Brazil.
