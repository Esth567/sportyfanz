It was more of just good tennis and working to make it happen without this baggage on your shoulders.</p><p>"It's something that is just surreal. I feel like tennis keeps surprising me, and I keep surprising myself."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Finding-more-peace" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Finding more peace</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>What makes victory even more surprising is Swiatek has been nowhere near her dominant best over the past year.</p><p>She did not reach a final for a year after her 2024 French Open triumph, slipping to eighth in the world - her lowest ranking since March 2022 - as a result.</p><p>There were a mixture of reasons - on and off the court - as to why Swiatek's level has dipped.</p><p>Losing in the Olympic semi-finals in Paris last summer was a bitter blow, with Swiatek saying she cried for "six hours" afterwards.</p><p>In November, it was announced Swiatek had tested positive for heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample. She was subsequently given a one-month ban after the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted the result was caused by contamination.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But one person who did call Swiatek's remarkable Wimbledon win was former Grand Slam semi-finalist Andrea Petkovic - albeit, as she said herself, "for irrational reasons".</p><p>During Swiatek's semi-final match against Jasmine Paolini at grass-court tournament Bad Homburg, Petkovic spotted a large bird circling above Swiatek for around 10 minutes.</p><p>When the players changed ends, the bird followed Swiatek to the other side of the court, which Petkovic took as an omen.</p><p>"I said there and then she's going to win Wimbledon," Petkovic told BBC Radio 5 Live. </p><p>"For most of this year you could sense pressure and tension when she stepped on court.</p><p>"In Bad Homburg you could see that was gone."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="More-time-to-prepare-on-grass" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">More time to prepare on grass</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Before this year, Swiatek had only reached the second week of Wimbledon once, in a quarter-final run in 2023.</p><p>After a shock third-round defeat by Yulia Putintseva last year, Swiatek said she had not given herself enough time to mentally recover from her French Open win a few weeks earlier.</p><p>Having lost to Sabalenka in the Roland Garros semi-finals this year, Swiatek went to Mallorca for a week's training on grass before returning to competitive action in Bad Homburg.</p><p>Swiatek reached the final at the WTA 500 event, where a defeat by Jessica Pegula left her in tears, but it was an indication that her level on the surface had improved.</p><p>"I feel like I have developed as a player and I had time to practise a little bit more [this year]," said Swiatek.</p><p>"I would say we mainly focused on my movement and how I should stop before hitting the ball. </p><p>"Also, [we worked] on fast hands because obviously it's important here not to stop the movement, even though the ball sometimes is fast."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Forgiving-herself-a-bit-more" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'Forgiving herself' a bit more</span></h2></p><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Wim Fissette gives instructions to Iga Swiatek" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2048/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/c158/live/0c6d7030-5dc3-11f0-8328-5fcabfbdb3e1.jpg 976w" width="2048" height="1152"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Wim Fissette has coached multiple WTA players to Grand Slam titles, including Angelique Kerber at Wimbledon in 2018</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Swiatek replaced long-time coach Tomasz Wiktorowski with Wim Fissette late last year, and it has taken time for the tweaks she was making to bed in.</p><p>"When you make a big change and hire a new coach, it takes a while to see the changes," said Petkovic.</p><p>"You feel you're progressing and you're expecting to see results right away.
