        <p>The SEC takes center stage this week as Talking Season ramps up before the start of preseason camps. The conference takes over the <a href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">College Football</a> Hall of Fame in Atlanta for its annual event starting Monday, and hundreds of reporters will clamor for enticing quotes and hopefully a gripping storyline or two.</p><p>The SEC is deep and has several national contenders, but the transfer portal has seemingly provided equal footing in the middle and bottom of the conference. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/">Vanderbilt</a> knocking off No. 1 <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/">Alabama</a> provided the conference a wake-up call in the post-Nick Saban era last year.</p><p>The 2025 season figures to be dramatic for the SEC. The conference hasn't reached the national championship game in back-to-back years for the first time in 20 years. Plus, no head coaches were fired in 2024, so several coaches speaking at media days this week may be unemployed in a few months. The pressure is on, and there are plenty of questions to answer in the coming months.</p><p>Here are the top burning questions facing each SEC team entering media days.</p><div>

    <h2>Alabama</h2><p><strong>Can Kalen DeBoer get Tide in the CFP?</strong></p><p>The first-year results under Kalen DeBoer weren't unexpected, but it was still a disappointment for the Tide faithful. The losses to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/">Michigan</a> near the end of the season were salt in the wound. Alabama is more talented this season than last. Though many will pay attention to the perceived quarterback battle between <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/">Ty Simpson</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28905179/austin-mack/">Austin Mack</a>, the big-picture question is what matters: What happens if DeBoer misses the playoff with one of the nation's more talented rosters?</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/">Arkansas</a></h2><p><strong>Can Sam Pittman survive â€“ again?</strong></p><p>Arkansas leads the SEC in defections via the transfer portal over the last two seasons, and the lack of consistency has the Razorbacks poised for disappointment against one of the most demanding schedules in the country. The Hogs travel to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/">Ole Miss</a> and host <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/">Notre Dame</a> in September, and they hit the road to play <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/">Tennessee</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/">LSU</a> and rival <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/">Texas</a>. Good luck identifying seven wins against that schedule. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26697553/taylen-green/">Taylen Green</a> is underrated, but the quarterback needs a lot of help to keep the Hogs above water.</p><div>

    <h2><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/">Auburn</a></h2><p><strong>Is <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125321/jackson-arnold/">Jackson Arnold</a> the missing piece to the Tigers' puzzle?</strong></p><p>Auburn should be a lot better in Hugh Freeze's third season, but Jackson Arnold needs to be the reason why the Tigers exceed expectations. The Oklahoma transfer was benched during an ugly debut season as the full-time starter, and Freeze is confident the former blue-chip recruit just needs to be surrounded by better talent to succeed. The Tigers certainly have that at receiver, which might be a top-five group in the country. Seeing a Freeze offense struggle at quarterback the last two years is dumbfounding. That must change this fall.</p><div>

Eye-popping stats matter, but wins matter more. The Gators were 6-0 when Lagway played an entire game and 2-5 when he did not. Is Lagway ready to be the face of the program and the savior (again) for Napier, who enters the season 19-19 as the Gators' coach? Five returning starters along the offensive line certainly provide confidence.</p>

The issue is whether everyone comes together and knows how to compete week to week in the SEC.

Whether he can elevate himself and the team to the next level and contend for a 10-win season is the next step under head coach Shane Beamer. Sellers flew under the radar in 2024. That won't be the case this fall with six new starters.&nbsp;</p><div>

    <h2>Tennessee</h2><p><strong>What does Tennessee look like without <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123367/nico-iamaleava/">Nico Iamaleava</a>?</strong></p><p>Tennessee essentially swapped quarterbacks when Nico Iamaleava left the school, leading the Vols to land <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/">UCLA</a>'s Joey Aguilar. For all the big numbers Tennessee put up early last season, the Vols still struggled in some key games. Aguilar provides a veteran presence after throwing for 6,760 yards in two years at <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/APLST/appalachian-state-mountaineers/">Appalachian State</a>, but what will Josh Heupel's offense look like with eight new starters?&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Texas</h2><p><strong>Does Texas have what it takes along the offensive line?</strong></p><p>All eyes are on <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/">Arch Manning</a>, but we should be more focused on what Manning is looking at in front of him: the offensive line. The Longhorns replace four starters in the trenches. Several players have experience but not as full-time starters. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874195/cole-hutson/">Cole Hutson</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29393319/brandon-baker/">Brandon Baker</a> are great, but figuring out the starting lineup and seeing whether they jell together before the opener at <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/">Ohio State</a> is critical.</p><div>

    <h2>Texas A&amp;M</h2><p><strong>Will the Aggies' defense be OK on the edge?</strong></p><p>The only returning player with much experience rushing the passer is <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26699728/cashius-howell/">Cashius Howell</a>, who led the team with four last season. The rush defense gave up too many explosive plays, too. Head coach Mike Elko has taken over play-calling duties this season, so it'll be interesting to hear how he plans to fix the issues after losing a few defensive players to the NFL.</p><div>

    <h2>Vanderbilt</h2><p><strong>Is Vanderbilt better than last season's surprise team?</strong></p><p>The return of quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873851/diego-pavia/">Diego Pavia</a> is one of the bigger developments in the country after he was granted an additional year via a court injunction. The key is whether the Commodores, who won seven games last season, have upgraded along the offensive line after the superstar was hit a few too many times last season. The defense is fantastic, with seven returning starters from a unit that allowed less than 24 points per game. The 'Dores look pretty good.</p>
