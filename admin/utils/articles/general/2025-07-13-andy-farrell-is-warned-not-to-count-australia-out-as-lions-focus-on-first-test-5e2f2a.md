That’s going to be one of their key assets. I’m sure that Wallabies team will know what they want to do and believe in it.</p><p>“The Lions will be happy with all their wins to date … they’ll be primed. But there’s something about the Wallabies. If they can be tough enough at the ball carry to get some front-foot ball against the Lions, they’ll be a challenge.”</p><p>Farrell is certainly not lacking for unsolicited advice as he prepares to finalise his best matchday 23. The reliably sharp Ronan O’Gara, a pundit for Sky Sports, believes the Lions should name their strongest front-row combination on the bench, on the grounds that most big Tests are decided in the final quarter. The whole of Wales, meanwhile, wants their solitary representative, Jac Morgan, to feature in some capacity.</p><p>Foster also rates Morgan – “You can’t help but be impressed with him at the moment” – but there remains every chance that either Josh van der Flier or Tom Curry will be preferred at openside. With Garry Ringrose going through return-to-play protocols after reporting delayed concussion symptoms, the midfield equation also continues to generate much debate. The in-form Huw Jones is now poised to start at 13, which strengthens the case for picking his Scotland teammate Sione Tuipulotu at 12 instead of Bundee Aki.</p><figure id="96ad6110-2240-49d7-a011-5c4eb2505820" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/327b96741833aac9825d41dc1d5a1ccf488659ea/597_0_4581_3666/master/4581.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/327b96741833aac9825d41dc1d5a1ccf488659ea/597_0_4581_3666/master/4581.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/327b96741833aac9825d41dc1d5a1ccf488659ea/597_0_4581_3666/master/4581.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/327b96741833aac9825d41dc1d5a1ccf488659ea/597_0_4581_3666/master/4581.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/327b96741833aac9825d41dc1d5a1ccf488659ea/597_0_4581_3666/master/4581.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/327b96741833aac9825d41dc1d5a1ccf488659ea/597_0_4581_3666/master/4581.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Ian Foster at the captain’s run in Adelaide." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/327b96741833aac9825d41dc1d5a1ccf488659ea/597_0_4581_3666/master/4581.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356.11656843483956" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘There’s something about the Wallabies’: Ian Foster believes Australia can cause the Lions problems in Brisbane.</span> Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Then there is the bench mix, with Farrell likely to want some second-half turbo thrust in the form of either Ben Earl or Henry Pollock, with Tadhg Beirne as second-row cover. Owen Farrell’s stock is also rising because of his ability to operate at 10 and 12. He looked immediately at home when he came on against the AU &amp; NZ Invitational XV and, despite a recent lack of rugby, is an increasingly decent bet to leapfrog Marcus and Fin Smith for a bench role.</p><p>With Ben White pushing Alex Mitchell for the reserve scrum-half slot and impressing Andy Farrell – “I thought he was excellent” – and Mack Hansen offering useful back-three cover, the Lions’ head coach would have all bases pretty much covered, unless he opts for a 6-2 bench. In that case, Earl’s ability to operate in midfield if needed might count in his favour. “When we get to Brisbane we’ll have a coaches’ meeting like we always do and discuss how the week is going to unfold,” Farrell said. “No doubt selection will be a big part of that.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>On paper a strong combination should emerge, but there is no guarantee a clutch of comfortable tour victories in Australia will translate into a routine series win. According to Pollock, however, the Lions are feeling bullish as they await the serious business. “We want to come here and be the best Lions team ever,” said the 20-year-old scorer of one of the Lions’ eight tries in Adelaide. “We’ve been talking about that loads and, yeah, 3-0 is definitely on the table, hopefully.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Ireland tighthead prop Tom Clarkson will join the Lions squad as “additional front-row cover”. The 25-year-old was given his Ireland debut by Farrell in November and has gone on to win eight caps.</p><p>The Lions insist Clarkson’s call-up is not because of any injury concerns regarding the three tightheads already in the squad – Tadhg Furlong, Will Stewart and Finlay Bealham.</p></div></div>
