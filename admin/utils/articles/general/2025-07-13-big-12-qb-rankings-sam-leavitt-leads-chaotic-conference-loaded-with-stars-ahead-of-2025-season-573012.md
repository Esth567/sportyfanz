The Utes are hoping the package deal -- much like <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/">Oklahoma</a>'s signing of former <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/">Washington State</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915380/john-mateer/">John Mateer</a> and offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle -- results in a bevy of explosive plays from the dual-threat option.</p>

    <h2>5. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877253/josh-hoover/">Josh Hoover</a>, TCU</h2><p>Is this the most underrated quarterback in the country? Perhaps. Only Colorado's Shedeur Sanders had a higher completion percentage and more yards per attempt than Hoover last fall.&nbsp;<a href="https://247sports.com/article/tcu-qb-josh-hoover-declines-lucrative-offer-to-transfer-to-tennessee-per-report-248999475/" target="_blank">Hoover reportedly turned down a lucrative offer from a nationally-ranked SEC program</a> this spring to stay with the Horned Frogs. That speaks volumes to what others see in him after throwing for 3,949 yards, 27 touchdowns and 11 interceptions last season. Hoover won't be a secret for long if he puts together a big performance to spoil Bill Belichick's <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UNC/north-carolina-tar-heels/">North Carolina</a> debut in the season opener.</p>

When he's on, the Wildcats are a conference frontrunner. They were in contention coming down the stretch last fall before a November swoon that Johnson hopes to avoid this time around.</p><div>

That's how one NFL source described Rocco Becht. He threw for 3,505 yards last year with 25 touchdowns thanks to a scheme that played to his strengths and allowed for various deep shots downfield. Iowa State's new-look wideout room should result in another impressive season from the Cyclones' QB1.</p>

    <h2>1. Sam Leavitt, Arizona State</h2><p>There's no use arguing this one. Leavitt is the Big 12's best to open the 2025 season and it's not particularly close. How his first campaign as the<em> hunted</em>&nbsp;unfolds remains to be seen, but Leavitt's strengths as a play-action passer makes NFL scouts salivate. The <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/">Michigan State</a> transfer finished with 2,885 yards passing, 24 touchdowns and six interceptions, leading the Sun Devils to a conference title and playoff appearance. A repeat CFP trip -- this time without co-star Cam Skattebo -- could rocket Leavitt into the Heisman discussion.&nbsp;</p>
