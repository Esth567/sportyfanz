<p>Judkins was drafted out of Ohio State with the fourth pick of the second round. With longtime Brown <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131579/nick-chubbs/">Nick Chubb's</a> departure, many of the carries in the upcoming season are expected to be split between Judkins and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966543/jerome-ford/">Jerome Ford</a>, who has stepped into a role as Cleveland's top running back after season-ending injuries to Chubb over the past two seasons.</p><p>The Browns also drafted <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28912068/dylan-sampson/">Dylan Sampson</a>&nbsp;out of Tennessee in the fourth round in their attempt to rebuild the running room in the wake of Chubb leaving in free agency.</p>
        

<p>Judkins started his collegiate career at Ole Miss, where he 2,725 yards and 31 touchdowns on 545 carries over two seasons. After transferring to Ohio State, Judkins rushed for 1,060 yards and 14 touchdowns for the national champions.</p>
