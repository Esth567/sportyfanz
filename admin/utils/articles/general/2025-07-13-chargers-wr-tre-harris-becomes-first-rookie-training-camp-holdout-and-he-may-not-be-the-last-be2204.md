        <p>Rookies for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/">Los Angeles Chargers</a>&nbsp;reported to training camp Saturday, and every player was there except one: No. 55 overall pick wide receiver&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162525/tre-harris/">Tre Harris</a> out of Ole Miss. <a href="https://x.com/RapSheet/status/1944172088010715619" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NFL Media reports</a> the second-round pick is officially a training camp holdout, and it could spell trouble for other <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/">NFL teams</a> that made a second-round pick in this year's draft.</p><p>While the reason Harris is holding out was not specifically stated, it's not tough to figure out. In fact, he may not be the only second-round pick to hold out this month.&nbsp;</p><p>Out of the 32 second-round picks made in April, just two have signed their contracts. The <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/">Houston Texans</a> gave wide receiver <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26708551/jayden-higgins/">Jayden Higgins</a> an unprecedented rookie deal in May, gifting him a fully-guaranteed contract. Then, the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/">Cleveland Browns</a> gave linebacker <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26724333/carson-schwesinger/">Carson Schwesinger</a> a fully-guaranteed contract as well. We know that <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/">New Orleans Saints</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964064/tyler-shough/">Tyler Shough</a> has been <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-what-is-holding-up-nfl-draft-second-rounders-from-signing-rookie-deals/" target="_blank">fighting behind the scenes </a></span>for a fully-guaranteed contract, and odds are he's not the only second-round pick looking to follow in the footsteps of Higgins and Schwesigner.&nbsp;</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-rookie-running-back-quinshon-judkins-arrested-charged-with-domestic-violence-in-florida/" target="_blank">

<p>What's interesting about this situation is that Harris and other second-round picks completed on-field work through OTAs and minicamp. This wasn't a situation like that of <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/">Cincinnati Bengals</a> first-round pick <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28923420/shemar-stewart/">Shemar Stewart</a>, who has not signed his rookie contract due to language that could potentially void future money. He hasn't participated in any drills.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Harris is the first second-round pick to not report to camp, so it's fair to wonder if the other unsigned second-round picks will also hold out. Tuesday is a day to watch, as there are six teams that expect rookies to report: The <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/">Baltimore Ravens</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/">Buffalo Bills</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/">Miami Dolphins</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/">New York Giants</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/">San Francisco 49ers</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/">Seattle Seahawks</a>.</p><h2>Next potential second-round holdouts</h2><table data-title="7x2 Table"><tbody><tr><th>Player</th><th>Team</th></tr><tr><td><p>EDGE <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26706090/mike-green/">Mike Green</a></p></td><td><p>Ravens</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DL <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26723652/t-j-sanders/">T.J.
