There was banter aplenty and a loud: “It’s whatsherface!” was shouted by a fan who rushed to get a photo with the comedian Maisie Adam; she and her fellow stand-up Suzi Ruffell were stopped by fans desperate for selfies every few paces.</p><p>For the Lionesses, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/england-wales-womens-euro-2025-match-report" data-link-name="in body link">6-1 win over Wales</a> was an example of how to manage emotions rather than be consumed by them. A businesslike focus had settled over the side in the buildup to the fixture, the hard yards run in Zurich against the Netherlands, in St Gallen they “just” needed to win and the goal celebrations were minimal. This was a game ruled by emotion for Wales but not for the European champions, who had already shifted into knockout mode.</p><p>Critically, Sarina Wiegman has found the formation with the personnel to fit it that makes England a formidable force and serious contenders. The setup in the first game against France had been experimental, Lauren James placed in the No 10 role despite having just returned from a hamstring injury.</p><p>It didn’t work. After a thrilling start England struggled with a lack of stability in the middle, James was, rightly, allowed to roam, leaving a below-par Keira Walsh and Georgia Stanway overrun.</p><p>Against the Netherlands the shifting of James to the right, in place of Beth Mead, and the return of Ella Toone in the middle proved fruitful. Against Wales, the fruit was ripened, Lucy Bronze and James’s partnership on the right restored and reminiscent at times of the blistering axis established by Bronze and Nikita Parris at the 2019 World Cup.</p><figure id="5234cc29-ae55-44a6-a66d-a6a95cab24f4" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4ea0bdc1113fe009e52dd31853296f04284dea/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4ea0bdc1113fe009e52dd31853296f04284dea/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4ea0bdc1113fe009e52dd31853296f04284dea/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4ea0bdc1113fe009e52dd31853296f04284dea/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4ea0bdc1113fe009e52dd31853296f04284dea/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4ea0bdc1113fe009e52dd31853296f04284dea/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Lauren James on the ball against Wales at Euro 2025." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4ea0bdc1113fe009e52dd31853296f04284dea/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.70374999999996" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Lauren James has benefited from being moved to the right after starting the first match of Euro 2025 in the No 10 role.</span> Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Against the Dutch Walsh was the supporting act to the Bronze and James show whereas here, under candy-floss-coloured clouds as the sun set against Wales, it was Toone who connected with the right flank and the movement, passing and runs between the gut-busting trio were electric.</p><p>It was England’s right that produced the third and fourth goals. First James paused on the ball, time almost standing still as Toone overlapped. The ball was finally played to Toone, who sent in a cross that was met by Lauren Hemp at the far post and nodded in. For the fourth Bronze, James and Toone combined again, fast-paced passing in their constantly shifting tight triangle bamboozling the Wales defence, in particular Lily Woodham, who was hooked at half‑time, before Toone broke to the byline and pulled back to Alessia Russo, who poked in.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>As in 2019, the potency on the right is enabled by the work being done on the left. Alex Greenwood’s shift back into her old left-back berth for Jess Carter to fit more comfortably in alongside the centre-back Leah Williamson proved desperately needed. With Hemp ahead of her, the left is as threatening as the right, making it harder for opponents to pinpoint and stifle England’s attack.</p><p>The magical flow of England’s flanks was disrupted a little at the break, with Toone and Hemp off in place of Jess Park and Mead, but England’s greatest asset is the strength in the depth of the squad. James was replaced by Chloe Kelly later, as was Russo by Aggie Beever‑Jones and Bronze made way with 11 minutes remaining too. Freed of the threat of an exit by the first-half feast, England’s entire frontline and right were changed but still the goals kept coming.</p><p>Eight days ago, England’s group-stage obituaries were being contemplated in not-so-hushed circles after a bruising and frustrating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/05/france-england-womens-euro-2025-match-report" data-link-name="in body link">2-1 loss to France</a>. Now, after <em>Les Bleues’</em> defeat of the Netherlands, England’s second-place finish leaves an enticing route to the final. They have avoided Spain on their side of the draw, with a quarter-final against Sweden next. Critically, England’s diversity in attack, threat from both flanks and extreme depth in those areas have them looking very difficult to play against.</p></div></div>
