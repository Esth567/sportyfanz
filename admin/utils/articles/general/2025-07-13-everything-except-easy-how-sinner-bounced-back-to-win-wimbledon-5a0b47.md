After what Cahill described as an "awesome" practice week, he won nine successive sets for the loss of just 17 games in his first three matches.</p><p>But, as he posed with his trophy on Sunday evening, it was easy to forget that Sinner came within four games of a shock exit.</p><p>He was two sets down against Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round and struggling before the Bulgarian suffered <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cwyxp1g8v0xo">a match-ending injury.</a></p><p>Sinner also injured his elbow in a fall during the match, but he withstood the lingering discomfort to dismiss American 10th seed Ben Shelton and seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straights sets to reach the final.</p><p>"I would say mostly emotionally [it took a lot] because I had a very tough loss in Paris," Sinner said on court, before exchanging a smile with Alcaraz.</p><p>"It doesn't matter how you win or lose, you just have to understand what you did wrong and work on that. </p><p>"We tried to accept the loss and keep working.
