description: "No one from Fifpro present at Fifa meeting in New York  Fifa says players should have 72 hours ‘at least’ between games  Fifa’s dispute with the global players’ union, Fifpro, appears to have escalated after the announcement from world football’s governing body that it supports the principle of mandatory rest periods for top stars. While Fifpro welcomed the commitment to a 72-hour gap between games during the season, as well as a three-week break during the summer, it is understood union executives have been left nonplussed by what has been described as a flawed process. The Guardian has learned that no one from Fifpro or the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) was present at the meeting with Fifa officials in New York on Saturday that led to what was an unexpected announcement. In a photograph that accompanied Fifa’s press release its president, Gianni Infantino, was pictured with union officials from all over the world, but many of them were from organisations expelled from Fifpro, while others were former Fifpro leaders who have left office after elections. Fifpro and Fifa declined to comment when contacted by The Guardian.  Continue reading..."

Amid the high temperatures which have been a feature of the Club World Cup, Fifpro’s medical director, Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, called for half-time breaks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/30/fifpro-calls-for-longer-half-time-breaks-after-extreme-heat-wake-up-call-at-club-world-cup" data-link-name="in body link">to be extended to 20 minutes</a>.</p><p>A Fifa statement said: “The meeting addressed key issues concerning player health [men and women], a top priority given that it forms part of the occupational risk prevention framework established by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Fifa and the player unions reviewed upcoming joint projects involving the world’s football governing body and players’ representative organisations, with a specific focus on player rest and recovery, as well as competitions within the context of the international match calendar [IMC].</p><p>“There is a consensus that there must be at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and that players should have a rest period/holiday of at least 21 days at the end of each season. This period should be managed individually by each club and the respective players depending on their match calendars, and taking into account applicable collective agreements.</p><p>“Furthermore, a rest day per week should also be planned, whilst being managed pragmatically. In addition, it was discussed that player travel – especially long-haul intercontinental trips – and the climatic conditions under which matches are played, should be considered when defining policies for the upcoming IMC.”</p><figure id="3f1a022e-af4b-4b20-9857-e2182ccebe19" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02872262d59c77d9bc9b12715d254d15834073bb/177_24_3904_2862/master/3904.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02872262d59c77d9bc9b12715d254d15834073bb/177_24_3904_2862/master/3904.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02872262d59c77d9bc9b12715d254d15834073bb/177_24_3904_2862/master/3904.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02872262d59c77d9bc9b12715d254d15834073bb/177_24_3904_2862/master/3904.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02872262d59c77d9bc9b12715d254d15834073bb/177_24_3904_2862/master/3904.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02872262d59c77d9bc9b12715d254d15834073bb/177_24_3904_2862/master/3904.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Fluminense’s Thiago Silva has a mid-match drink at the Club World Cup" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02872262d59c77d9bc9b12715d254d15834073bb/177_24_3904_2862/master/3904.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="326.2269467213115" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Fluminense’s Thiago Silva has a drink as he and his teammates struggle with the heat at the Club World Cup.</span> Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>While Fifa’s statement conceded the need to strike a balance between club and international competitions, it also made clear that they will not back down from the principle of creating more global events. “Regarding competitions, Fifa and the player unions agreed on the importance of striking the right balance between national team football and club football on the one hand, and between domestic, continental and global club competitions on the other hand.</p><p>“It is important to create opportunities for players from all over the world to compete in top competitions as this boosts global football development.
