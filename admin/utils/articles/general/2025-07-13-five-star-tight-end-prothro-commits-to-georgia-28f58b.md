A priority in-state target for coach Kirby Smart, Prothro took official visits to <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2/auburn-tigers" target="_blank">Auburn</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/333/alabama-crimson-tide" target="_blank">Alabama</a>, Georgia, Florida and Texas before narrowing his recruitment to the Bulldogs, Gators and Longhorns last month.</p><p>He announced his commitment to Georgia in a ceremony at Bowdon High School, where Prothro has hauled in 89 passes for 2,034 yards and 35 touchdowns over the past two seasons.</p><p>Prothro arrives as the Bulldogs' 17th ESPN 300 pledge in an incoming recruiting class that sits at No. 2 in ESPN's latest class rankings for the cycle, joining quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256473/jared-curtis">Jared Curtis</a> (No. 6 overall) as the program's second five-star commit in 2026. He now stands as the top-ranked member of a growing Georgia pass-catcher class that also includes four-star wide receivers <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/265206/brady-marchese">Brady Marchese</a> (No. 62) and <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260555/ryan-mosley">Ryan Mosley</a> (No. 120) and three-star <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/264120/craig-dandridge">Craig Dandridge</a>.</p><p>The Bulldogs, who produced six NFL draft picks at tight ends from 2019-24, have forged a reputation for developing top tight end talent under Smart and assistant coach Todd Hartley. Georgia signed ESPN's top two tight end prospects -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/253567/elyiss-williams">Elyiss Williams</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/253609/ethan-barbour">Ethan Barbour</a> -- in the 2025 class, and Prothro now follows four-stars <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/262463/brayden-fogle">Brayden Fogle</a> (No. 142 overall) and <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261348/lincoln-keyes">Lincoln Keyes</a> (No. 238) as the program's third tight end pledge in 2026.</p><p>Those arrivals, along with eligibility beyond 2025 for current Georgia tight ends <a data-player-guid="48ad0a08-9e0f-3251-8d14-6a7bd0cc44b3" href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4870874/lawson-luckie">Lawson Luckie</a> and <a data-player-guid="abb2f628-cd89-32dd-8e9f-c91f0bcba7c4" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5218582/jaden-reddell">Jaden Reddell</a>, could make for a crowded tight end room when Prothro steps on campus next year.</p><p>However, Prothro is expected to distinguish himself at the college level as a versatile downfield option capable of creating mismatches with a unique blend of size, speed and physicality in the mold of former two-time All-America Georgia tight end <a data-player-guid="bc4ba7ee-446b-36fd-9985-7fd2a94a98bc" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432665/brock-bowers">Brock Bowers</a>. His father Clarence told ESPN that Georgia intends to utilize Prothro across roles, including flex tight end and jumbo receiver, and said scheme fit was a key driving factor in his son's decision.</p><p>A three-time state football champion, Prothro caught 33 passes for 831 yards and 13 touchdowns as a sophomore in 2023. He eclipsed 1,200-yards in his junior campaign last fall, closing 2024 with 56 receptions (21.4 yards per catch) and 22 receiving touchdowns en route to a 13-2 finish and a third consecutive state championship. Prothro is also an All-Region baseball player and was credited with 20.7 points and 16.5 rebounds per game in his junior basketball season.</p>
