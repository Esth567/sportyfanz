<p>Anthony was the lone player left on the Magic's roster whom president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman signed off on drafting, and his trade to Memphis was a sign the franchise had moved on.</p><p>The Bucks are retooling their roster in hopes of appeasing Antetokounmpo, whose current deal with the franchise runs through the 2027-28 season. <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/giannis-antetokounmpo-addresses-his-future-with-bucks-says-he-doesnt-want-to-play-in-new-york/" target="_blank">Antetokounmpo, 30, was asked recently if plans to remain in Milwaukee</a></span>, the only team he has played for at this point in his career.&nbsp;</p>
