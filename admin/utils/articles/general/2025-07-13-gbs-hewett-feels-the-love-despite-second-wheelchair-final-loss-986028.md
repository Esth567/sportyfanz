Win or lose that is the real winner today," said the 27-year-old, who also lost in the doubles final with Gordon Reid.</p><p>"I don't think trophies can beat this sort of atmosphere and support. It is incredible. Last year was obviously such a special moment for me, my family and my team.</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>19 year old Oda beats GB's Hewett to win second wheelchair singles title</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"When you lose, to have this amount of love and support, this sort of atmosphere doesn't happen to us on a regular basis.</p><p>"It is really incredible the amount of support wheelchair tennis has got."</p><p>From the moment the pair broke each other's first service game it was clear this was going to be a tight and tense contest between two players who regularly meet at this stage of Grand Slams.</p><p>This was the seventh time in the last 10 major finals that they had faced each other and the exchange of breaks continued in a tight first set until Hewett broke in the seventh game, held and then took the first set with a fourth consecutive break.</p><p>The second set was even closer, with more breaks of serve from both players. It seemed destined to go to a tie-break as Hewett had break point with Oda leading 6-5, but the Japanese player raised his level once more to fend it off and level matters.</p><p>From then on he had the momentum as the exertion of a gruelling second set seemed to have taken its toll on Hewett. After getting the first break in the third game of the decider, Oda was in full control.</p><p>Hewett, lifted by the noise of the crowd, fended off match point on his serve, but it merely delayed Oda's win as he showed his quality to get over the line.</p><p>"Two years ago I won here, this tournament is different to others, it is so beautiful," he said. "I really appreciate this moment."</p><p>Meanwhile, Niels Vink won the Wimbledon quad singles title by defeating fellow Dutchman Sam Schroder 6-3 6-3 on court three.</p><p>The 22-year-old Vink, seeded first, added the prize to the doubles crown he won alongside Guy Sasson.</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
