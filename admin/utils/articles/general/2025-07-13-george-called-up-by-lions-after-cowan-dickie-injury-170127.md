Lions squad after Luke Cowan-Dickie emerged as an injury doubt for the first Test against Australia next Saturday.</b></p><p>Hooker Cowan-Dickie, 32, looks likely to miss the game in Brisbane after suffering a suspected concussion in Saturday's big win against the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c79q5j35jl0o">AUNZ Invitational XV.</a></p><p>The England forward left the field on a stretcher with his head in a supportive brace after being injured while tackling Lukhan Salakaia-Loto.</p><p>"He got up straight away as he got off the stretcher and he's back to being his normal self," said Lions head coach Andy Farrell.</p><p>"It's unfortunate for him, so we'll see what has to happen on the back of that."</p><p>Ireland and Leinster tight-head prop Tom Clarkson will also join the squad to provide additional front row cover.</p><p>Both of Ireland's regular tight-head props Tadhg Furlong and Finlay Bealham are already in Australia, with Clarkson linking up after starting Ireland's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cx23rwgrgl1o">106-7 win over Portugal</a> on Saturday.</p><p>George, a two-time Lions tourist, is in Argentina and was set to co-captain England in their second Test, but will instead join up with the Lions in Brisbane next week.</p><p>He also trained with the Lions in Dublin before the squad departed for Australia.</p><p>"We're absolutely delighted for Jamie's selection," said England head coach Steve Borthwick.</p><p>"This is also a fantastic opportunity for Theo and Curtis, who have both worked incredibly hard and really impressed in training."</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source

first Test</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Farrell, meanwhile, confirmed centre Garry Ringrose has been ruled out of the first Test against Australia.</p><p>Ringrose, 30, was in strong contention to start the first Test in Brisbane but suffered a concussion in the Lions' victory over <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c3d10gxe5zno">ACT Brumbies</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>Farrell confirmed the Ireland centre, who scored and was a standout performer against the Brumbies, would be available for the midweek game against First Nations and Pasifika XV on 22 July, before the second Test in Melbourne on 26 July.</p><p>Scotland's Huw Jones delivered another impressive performance on Saturday in the eight-try win against the AUNZ Invitational XV and now looks certain to start the opening Test at outside centre.</p><p>The 31-year-old has started his past two Lions games alongside Scotland and Glasgow Warriors centre partner Sione Tuipulotu, which could now be Farrell's first-Test midfield combination.</p><p>Ireland utility back Jamie Osborne was called up to the Lions squad on Thursday as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c335832vz7ro">"training cover"</a> for Scotland full-back Blair Kinghorn and is comfortable playing at centre or full-back.</p><p>"Garry had a delayed reaction. He had headaches for a day and it carried on for the next day so he went through concussion protocols and failed those," Farrell said.</p><p>"Unfortunately for him and for us he's [out for] 12 days, so that puts him out of the first Test and back in for the midweek game before the second Test.</p><p>"You don't mess around with these things and it is unfortunate for him and everyone else. He's in good spirits anyway, so we crack on."</p><p>The Lions' final Test against the Wallabies is on 2 August in Sydney.</p></div></article></div>
