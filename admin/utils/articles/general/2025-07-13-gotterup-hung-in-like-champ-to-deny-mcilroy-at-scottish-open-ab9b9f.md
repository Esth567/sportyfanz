It's all hitting me. It's just so cool. I played really well this week and I knew today was going to be tough.</p><p>"It was a pleasure to be out there with Rory and obviously all the support he gets is amazing, but it was nice to kind of ruin that a little bit."</p><p>Matt Fitzpatrick finished three shots off the top alongside Nicolai Hojgaard, while Justin Rose was one further back after posting the lowest round of the day with a bogey-free 63.</p><p>Xander Schauffele, who begins his Claret Jug defence on Thursday, ended on nine under alongside world number one Scottie Scheffler and Ludvig Aberg.</p><p>Dane Hojgaard and Germany's Matti Schmid earned the other two Open places that were available for those not already exempt.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Solid-Gotterup-outshines-McIlroy" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'Solid' Gotterup outshines McIlroy</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Crowd favourite McIlroy was the star attraction in the leading group but Gotterup - in just his second competitive outing on a links course - upstaged the world number two and several other star names.</p><p>Having started shakily with a bogey, the American recovered strongly to pick up birdies on three, seven and eight.</p><p>Fitzpatrick and Penge briefly were briefly among the leaders but Gotterup and McIlroy reached the turn locked together on 13 under.</p><p>That parity did not last long as Gotterup birdied two of the ensuing three holes to seize a two-shot advantage.</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Chris Gotterup seals Scottish Open win</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>His lead was halved when he overshot the 15th green and made bogey, but he immediately fought back with a 10-foot birdie on the par-five 16th where McIlroy could only post par.</p><p>The Northern Irishman failed to find a single birdie in his final 10 holes, but remained upbeat despite missing out on a second Scottish Open title in three years.</p><p>With The Open in his homeland up next, McIlroy said: "It was pretty windy and hard to get the ball super close.

They know all about him now.</p><p>A second-round 61 – equalling the course record – served notice of his talent and gave him the halfway lead. Plenty expected him to fade away, but he proved to be obdurately unyielding.</p><p>So who is the surprise champion? The 25-year-old, born in Maryland but raised in New Jersey, won the Jack Nicklaus Award as the top college golfer in the US in 2022.</p><p>He turned pro that year, initially plying his trade on the second-tier Korn Ferry Tour, then making the step up to the PGA Tour in 2024, marking his debut season with victory at the Myrtle Beach Classic.</p><p>This year has been more of a struggle though – Gotterup missed the cut in eight of his his opening 12 events. He had no top-10 finishes until this weekend and came into the tournament 88th in the FedEx Cup standings.</p><p>He is now a two-time winner on the PGA Tour, with the magnitude of this success dwarfing his debut win.</p><p>Oh, and Gotterup isn't just handy with a golf club. He was big into lacrosse as a kid, playing for more than 12 years, and credits that sport for helping to develop the speed of his mighty golf swing.</p></div></article></main></div></div>
