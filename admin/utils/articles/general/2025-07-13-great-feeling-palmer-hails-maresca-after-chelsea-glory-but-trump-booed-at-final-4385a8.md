It has been a slow process but there are growing signs that their youth-driven recruitment is working. In Maresca’s first season in charge Chelsea have qualified for the Champions League, won the Conference League and dominated PSG in a major final.</p><p>“It’s a great feeling,” Palmer said. “Even better because everyone doubted us before the game, we knew that. To put a fight on like we did, it’s good. The gaffer put a great gameplan out. He knew where the space was going to be. He tried to free me up as much as possible and I just had to repay him and score some goals.”</p><p>Palmer features alongside Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior on billboards in New York. “I’ve seen the billboards in Times Square and outside Madison Square Garden,” he said. “It’s a nice feeling to be alongside those type of players.”</p><p>Maresca was delighted with Palmer. “These are the games where we expect Cole to appear,” he said. “Big games and big moments and once again he showed how good he is.”</p><p>Chelsea, who have made around £90m from their time in the US, will have three weeks off before returning to training in the lead-up to the new season. They open their Premier League campaign by hosting Crystal Palace on 17 August. “Of course I am very excited [about the future],” Maresca said. “But I’m more excited that we have three weeks off.”</p><figure id="adcc228a-9307-4a2d-9d9f-f45fd7672d33" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7931ccfb70c2204bb394cc725b091b984431bed9/728_0_4950_3960/master/4950.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7931ccfb70c2204bb394cc725b091b984431bed9/728_0_4950_3960/master/4950.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7931ccfb70c2204bb394cc725b091b984431bed9/728_0_4950_3960/master/4950.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7931ccfb70c2204bb394cc725b091b984431bed9/728_0_4950_3960/master/4950.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7931ccfb70c2204bb394cc725b091b984431bed9/728_0_4950_3960/master/4950.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7931ccfb70c2204bb394cc725b091b984431bed9/728_0_4950_3960/master/4950.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Reece James lifts the trophy alongside his Chelsea teammates" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7931ccfb70c2204bb394cc725b091b984431bed9/728_0_4950_3960/master/4950.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Reece James lifts the trophy alongside his Chelsea teammates.</span> Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Maresca hailed his young side for carrying out the plan to perfection. “I have no words for the players,” the Italian said. “They all deserve this and it’s a good moment.

The conditions made it hard to keep going but the boys did well.”</p><p>There was praise for Palmer, who shone in a right-sided role, but Maresca focused on the whole team. “ Today we found a position for him where there was more space to attack,” he said. “Obviously Cole played really well but the effort from all the players was fantastic.”</p><figure id="ad4993ab-54d1-45b2-8622-c4bc90b204a5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317705bca66095af25f247c3a7d4cb1aa19acebb/661_222_5008_4007/master/5008.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317705bca66095af25f247c3a7d4cb1aa19acebb/661_222_5008_4007/master/5008.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317705bca66095af25f247c3a7d4cb1aa19acebb/661_222_5008_4007/master/5008.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317705bca66095af25f247c3a7d4cb1aa19acebb/661_222_5008_4007/master/5008.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317705bca66095af25f247c3a7d4cb1aa19acebb/661_222_5008_4007/master/5008.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317705bca66095af25f247c3a7d4cb1aa19acebb/661_222_5008_4007/master/5008.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Donald Trump looks over the golden glove with the Fifa president Gianni Infantino after the Club World Cup final" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317705bca66095af25f247c3a7d4cb1aa19acebb/661_222_5008_4007/master/5008.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356.05331469648564" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Donald Trump looks over the golden glove with the Fifa president Gianni Infantino after the Club World Cup final.</span> Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Maresca did not downplay Chelsea’s achievement in becoming world champions. “I think it will become as important as the Champions League and we value it as much as winning the Champions League,” he said.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-14" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>President Trump was jeered by the crowd on more than one occasion when he came on to the pitch for the trophy ceremony.

 “I have seen Maresca. I saw he had pushed others and we had to separate all the players and I do not know where that pressure came from. But this is a situation we must all avoid. My intention is that I wanted to separate the footballers so the situation didn’t become worse.”</p></div><p>Maresca said: “After the final whistle I approached Luis to talk to him and I saw that something was going on but I don’t know what happened really.”</p></div></div>
