I've been everywhere and it's been a brilliant tournament to work on and to watch here," Michael Brown, who has been covering the games for broadcasters Dazn, told BBC Sport.</p><p>BBC Sport looks at what the interest levels have been like and whether the tournament in this format can be considered a success or not.</p><p>You can have your say throughout.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="The-crowds" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">The crowds</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Much has been made of some of the low attendances.</p><p>Four matches failed to get 10,000 fans, with the lowest the 3,412 who watched Mamelodi Sundowns beat Ulsan HD 1-0.</p><p>But there have been 15 crowds of 60,000 or more, with the highest the 80,619 who saw PSG beat Atletico Madrid 4-0 in Pasadena.</p><p>Most of the highest attendances were at games involving PSG or Real Madrid, and the majority of knockout games have been well attended.</p><p>The average attendance of 38,369 is below that of any World Cup since Chile 1962.</p><p>Reasons given for some low attendances were the kick-off times (many were in the middle of a weekday), ticket prices, weather and concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raiding games.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"The decisive question is 'do the fans like it or not'?" said former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, Fifa's chief of global football development.</p><p>"We believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher. The answer is there."</p><p>A dynamic pricing structure, which is common in US sports, is being used, where the cost of tickets can change regularly.</p><p>Ticket prices for Chelsea's semi-final against Fluminense reportedly dropped from almost £350 to less than £10 in the week before the game.</p><p>Tickets for the Blues' quarter-final against Palmeiras ended up at £8, with fans talking about having paid more than £250 when they first went on sale.</p><p>"From the fans point of view, it's been positive," said ex-Premier League midfielder Brown, who has worked on 10 games involving 12 clubs.</p><p>"Everyone I've spoken to thinks it has been an incredible tournament and they have had a wonderful time.</p><p>"It feels like it's raised the awareness of football in so many countries.

Benfica took Chelsea to extra time thanks to a 95th-minute penalty - after a two-hour weather delay - before the Blues won 4-1.</p><p>Chelsea scored a late winner in the quarter-final against Palmeiras, with Estevao Willian, who joins them after the competition, netting against his soon-to-be team-mates.</p><p>Lionel Messi scored a free-kick, amateur side Auckland City picked up a point against Boca Juniors, having lost their first two games by a total of 16-0, and there have been games with scorelines of 4-4, 4-3, 4-2 and 5-2.</p><p>PSG, who have been sensational at times, beat Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Inter Miami 4-0.</p><p>PSG beat Bayern 2-0 despite having nine men - and there were three stoppage-time goals and a red card as Real beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2.</p><p>"We saw a few games at the start of the tournament which were a bit of a mismatch, but after that all the games have been competitive," said Brown.</p><p>"The mixture of cultures has been amazing. We've seen some different styles of play but a lot of quality everywhere.</p><p>"The Brazilian teams in particular contributed to that in a massive way. They set the standard in matches, put pressure on European teams and made them respond.</p><p>"What we do have to understand is that the European teams had not hit their stride when the tournament started because they'd had a bit of a rest first [after the end of their domestic seasons]."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Have-fans-been-interested-worldwide" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Have fans been interested worldwide?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The tournament - inevitably considering the lack of history or prestige - has not grabbed the attention of all football fans.</p><p>For example, the BBC Sport live pages and reports for the knockout rounds have had between 40% and 50% of the audience they would normally get for the Champions League equivalent.</p><p>But those are still big figures compared to many lesser followed competitions and sports.</p><p>Every match has been available to watch for free in the UK, with all 63 games on the Dazn app and Channel 5 showing 23.</p><p>Dazn has not replied to requests for the viewing figures, but Channel 5 said it was happy with how many people have watched the games it broadcast.</p><p>Chelsea v Los Angeles FC was watched by a peak of 1.6 million people in the UK. Real's game against Al-Hilal was seen by a peak of 1.1 million.</p><p>In Saudi Arabia more than 1.5 million people watched their win over Manchester City in the last 16 despite kicking off at 4am local time.</p><p>"There was not a single place that didn't have the Al-Hilal game on, and everyone was off the streets and watching it," content creator Fayad told BBC Sport, speaking about the quarter-final loss to Fluminense.</p><p>"The freeway was so empty. On a Friday night that never happens, not even during Ramadan."</p><p>Brazilians have arguably bought into the Club World Cup more than fans from any other nation. All four of their teams reached the knockout stages.</p><p>The Copacabana fan-fest hosted about 100,000 fans across the tournament.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Fatigue-and-injuries" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Fatigue and injuries</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>We will not know for several months yet how much of an impact this could have.</p><p>Many players involved have not had any break yet, with last season leading straight into international fixtures, which led straight into the Club World Cup.</p><p>Most teams start their 2025-26 campaign about a month after the Club World Cup ends, with the need to have a break and fit their pre-season into those four weeks.</p><p>"I try not to think about it, otherwise I will be so anxious," Manchester City manager <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/30/club-world-cup-manchester-city-pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola said<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> recently.</p><p>"Maybe in November, December, January, ask me.
