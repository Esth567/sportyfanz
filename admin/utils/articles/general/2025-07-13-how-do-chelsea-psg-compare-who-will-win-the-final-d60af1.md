So how will it play out at MetLife, and who are the players to watch out for on Sunday?</p><hr><h2>Who are the favorites?</h2><p>PSG are the undisputed best team in the world right now. Their 5-0 Champions League final win against <a data-clubhouse-guid="864b1935-65cc-fb9b-850d-790e4c8a8d47" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=110">Inter Milan</a> in Munich was the biggest winning margin for a team becoming champions of Europe, and they've reached the final of this competition by blowing away <a data-clubhouse-guid="66434654-a8ba-a04c-98e5-6bbd0dbbb780" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=86">Real Madrid</a> in a 4-0 semifinal victory that could, and should, have ended with a heavier defeat for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/esp.1">LaLiga</a> giants.</p><p>So, when you consider that Chelsea secured Champions League qualification via the Premier League only on the final day of the 2024-25 season before winning the Conference League, UEFA's third-tier competition, the two teams are miles apart on paper. But Maresca's team has grown into the competition, and Chelsea are just 90 minutes away from becoming world champions.</p><p>PSG should win, but Chelsea have shown that they know how to get the job done, so this game will be closer than many expect.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/160.png" width="50"></p><h2>How did PSG get here?</h2><p>PSG have been the outstanding team of the Club World Cup, recording wins against fellow European heavyweights <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/1068/Atletico-Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> (4-0), <a data-clubhouse-guid="25b5e432-d3d2-939f-f73b-6e531a6fbd91" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=132">Bayern Munich</a> (2-0) and Real Madrid (4-0) to make it to the final. They haven't been invincible, though.</p><p>A 1-0 defeat against <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/conmebol.libertadores">Copa Libertadores</a> champions <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/6086/botafogo">Botafogo</a> in the group stage showed that PSG could be beaten, although Luis Enrique may point to his team being without star players <a data-player-guid="5c936c66-707c-6b18-bbef-6214d951771d" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/229744/ousmane-dembele">Ousmane Dembélé</a>, <a data-player-guid="3f4da3cb-c4c3-3421-91ee-b8defa5f7f53" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/355061/joao-neves">João Neves</a>, <a data-player-guid="70c7088d-af91-f008-6fde-27addeb58a13" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/214596/fabian-ruiz">Fabián Ruiz</a> and <a data-player-guid="486c975c-4d32-255f-1aa8-6a879631ea48" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/297070/marquinhos">Marquinhos</a> for that game.</p><p>PSG's consistent performance in the Champions League throughout the four-year qualification period for the Club World Cup secured their place in the tournament, but their Champions League final success against Inter Milan in May confirmed their status as the team to beat in the U.S. They have lived up to that billing so far, and Luis Enrique even had the luxury of substituting Dembélé, Ruiz, <a data-player-guid="a1cf7fd7-1110-341d-ad03-f44c09ae2bb5" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/336388/desire-doue">Désiré Doué</a> and <a data-player-guid="337aee12-62ec-afa4-29c4-f7af9f3e15b1" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/274745/khvicha-kvaratskhelia">Khvicha Kvaratskhelia</a> in the second half of the semifinal win against Real to conserve their energy for the final.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/363.png" width="50"></p><h2>How did Chelsea get here?</h2><p>Chelsea needed a win in their final group game against <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/8377/esperance-sportive-de-tunis">Esperance Sportive de Tunis</a> to reach the knockout stages after a 3-1 defeat against <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/819/flamengo">Flamengo</a> put their progression at risk. Since reaching the round of 16, though, Chelsea have had luck on their side in terms of enjoying a favorable route to the final.</p><p>Bayern's surprise group-stage loss to <a data-clubhouse-guid="c0d080f4-ddad-14be-1498-51f86a0f24fa" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=1929">Benfica</a> meant that Chelsea avoided the <a data-league-guid="30244926-00c4-3f69-8946-f8421c97ff71" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/GER.1">Bundesliga</a> giants and faced the Portuguese team in the round of 16. eventually winning 4-1 after extra time in Charlotte, North Carolina. Chelsea then defeated Brazilian teams <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/2029/palmeiras">Palmeiras</a> (2-1) and <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/3445/fluminense">Fluminense</a> (2-0) to secure a clash against PSG in the final.</p><p>Chelsea earned their Club World Cup spot by virtue of winning the Champions League in 2021 -- the start of the four-year qualification period -- but their absence from Europe's top club competition for the past two years highlights how the Stamford Bridge team sneaked into the tournament by its achievements under a different coach and ownership group four years ago.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/160.png" width="50"></p><h2>PSG key players to watch</h2><p>Where do you start with PSG? They are a team of outstanding individual talent, but their success lies in all of those players being willing and able to match their talent with supreme work rate and team ethic.</p><p>Dembélé is the star player in Luis Enrique's team, though, and the <a data-clubhouse-guid="81be996c-0f98-eec4-6284-c6be0d186360" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=478">France</a> forward is now the clear favorite to win this year's Ballon d'Or. The 28-year-old has scored 35 goals and registered 14 assists in 52 appearances for PSG this season, and has dispelled all previous doubts over his ability to stay fit and reach his potential.</p><p>He had a tough 5-½ seasons at <a data-clubhouse-guid="58f7c4a9-c991-4ed4-fe5c-1f833cba75b8" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=83">Barcelona</a> following a big-money move from <a data-clubhouse-guid="6cdd01c7-3938-6f1d-0c24-c7cf7da68d2b" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=124">Borussia Dortmund</a> in 2018, but since moving to Paris in 2023, Dembélé has lived up to all of the hype.</p><p>Even if Chelsea can stop Dembélé, though, they will then have to stop Kvaratskhelia and Doué on the wings, or somehow overpower the midfield of Ruiz, <a data-player-guid="025e47e3-91a4-3a04-bd98-66fca18c9a04" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/403234/vitinha">Vitinha</a> and Neves. And then there are the two fullbacks, <a data-player-guid="5c8662cd-474c-892f-369c-15544105fe99" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/240233/achraf-hakimi">Achraf Hakimi</a> and <a data-player-guid="bcd38483-c60b-0252-80d5-14eb40d25155" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/290591/nuno-mendes">Nuno Mendes</a>, who are the best in the world at their position right now.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/363.png" width="50"></p><h2>Chelsea key players to watch</h2><p>Until two weeks ago, it was all about <a data-player-guid="6db4c779-7f2c-07f7-14ce-64d74f7d7fad" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/296395/cole-palmer">Cole Palmer</a> for Chelsea. When the former <a data-clubhouse-guid="94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382">Manchester City</a> forward plays well, he usually scores and Chelsea tend to win.</p><p>But while Palmer, 23, is still the man who can take Maresca's team to another level, £55 million summer signing <a data-player-guid="23bd493f-7c2f-347f-92d9-78ed75a80811" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/339075/joao-pedro">João Pedro</a> has arrived to share the load with Palmer and give Chelsea a sharper cutting edge up front. The former <a data-clubhouse-guid="78c91a3f-9e5e-c8fe-8fca-778e97cb021a" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=331">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a> forward said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXPaI74jSkc&amp;ab_channel=ESPNUK" target="_blank">he was "on the beach" in </a><a data-clubhouse-guid="2a051c42-4444-8263-799a-6cdd866bd8f7" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=205">Brazil</a> when the Chelsea deal was done halfway through the tournament, but he made an immediate impact by scoring twice against former team Fluminense in the semifinal.</p><p>With Chelsea also adding former <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/373/ipswich-town">Ipswich Town</a> striker <a data-player-guid="0406d93b-ba27-3365-9c3b-5aba080308c6" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/307114/liam-delap">Liam Delap</a> and ex-Borussia Dortmund winger <a data-player-guid="65a64ce2-1bf8-341e-9f15-6b1d3e9a9d20" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/339879/jamie-gittens">Jamie Gittens</a> to their squad this summer, Maresca has plenty of attacking options, but the players who could hurt PSG are Palmer and João Pedro.</p><p>One key element for Chelsea is the fitness of midfielder <a data-player-guid="f4aa8cdd-a976-53d4-a320-be7958cbcf1b" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/289877/moises-caicedo">Moisés Caicedo</a>, who limped out of the semifinal with an ankle injury. If he is unfit to face PSG, that will make stopping their midfield unit almost impossible.</p><h2>The tactical battle between the coaches</h2><p>Luis Enrique's PSG play a 4-3-3 formation that is built around their midfield axis of Neves, Vitinha and Ruiz. The challenge for Maresca will be about how Chelsea can disrupt that midfield, especially as his 4-2-3-1 formation will leave the Blues outnumbered in the center of the pitch.</p><p>PSG are so strong in the midfield area that Maresca will almost certainly have to tweak his system to be able to compete with the European champions. PSG keep the ball so well that it would be incredibly risky if Maresca sticks with his two-man midfield -- a risk that will be exacerbated if Caicedo fails to overcome his injury.</p><p>But it is not just about stopping PSG in midfield. Their attacking fullbacks Hakimi and Mendes, in tandem with wingers Doué and Kvaratskhelia, will make life incredibly tough for Chelsea's <a data-player-guid="55ff994c-d0ad-d6f8-cbb0-922ad9b25382" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/259910/marc-cucurella">Marc Cucurella</a> and <a data-player-guid="b89d5b36-af9b-ee96-1d95-3dcb40636b86" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/189007/reece-james">Reece James</a>. Both Cucurella and James like to attack, but they will have to stay back to nullify PSG's threat out wide.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/160.png" width="50"></p><h2>Why are PSG so good?</h2><p>Luis Enrique was happy to see <a data-player-guid="61edbcca-c316-afde-575f-d9dd69176cc4" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231388/kylian-mbappe">Kylian Mbappé</a> leave PSG a year ago, when the forward ran down his contract to join Real Madrid as a free agent. The manager tried and failed to make Mbappé work harder for the team -- the failure was probably on Mbappé's part rather than Luis Enrique's -- so his departure was regarded as no great loss because it enabled the coach to build a team of players who work incredibly hard for the side.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45707876" data-cerebro-id="686fa5d1f9cb241c51c2d3cb" data-title="Laurens: Dembélé has secured Ballon d'Or at Club World Cup" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Laurens_Dembele_has_secured_Ballon_dOr_at_Club_World_Cup_2025_7_10%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Laurens_Dembele_has_secured_Ballon_dOr_at_Club_World_Cup_2025_7_10.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Laurens_Dembele_has_secured_Ballon_dOr_at_Club_World_Cup_2025_7_10%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Laurens_Dembele_has_secured_Ballon_dOr_at_Club_World_Cup_2025_7_10.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Laurens_Dembele_has_secured_Ballon_dOr_at_Club_World_Cup_2025_7_10%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Laurens_Dembele_has_secured_Ballon_dOr_at_Club_World_Cup_2025_7_10.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45707876">play</span><figcaption><p>1:35</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Laurens: Dembélé has secured Ballon d'Or at Club World Cup</p><p>Julien Laurens reacts to Ousmane Dembélé's performances at the Club World Cup.</p></div></div><p>That is the beauty of this PSG team.
