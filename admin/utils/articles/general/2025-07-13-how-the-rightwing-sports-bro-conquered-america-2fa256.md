Once a workaday punter with the Indianapolis Colts, McAfee is now the most influential pundit in American sports with an eponymous ESPN show, who has more than 11m followers across YouTube, X, Instagram and TikTok. To howls of merriment from his panel, McAfee spelled out the rumor centered on a 19-year-old female student at Ole Miss, a public university in Mississippi, as it was “being reported by everybody on the internet”: that the student had sex with her boyfriend’s father. “Ole Miss dads are slinging meat right now!” roared “Boston” Connor Campbell, one of McAfee’s sidekicks.

Provocation, abrasiveness and a delight in offending have been essential to sports talk – on radio and cable TV – for decades. But in the years before social media, on-demand programming and betting turned sports into an all-hours, all-platforms juggernaut, there were still lines that sporting pundits could not cross: shock jock Don Imus, for instance, built his career on being outspoken but was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/27/don-imus-dead-radio-dj-racism" data-link-name="in body link">fired</a> by WFAN/MSNBC in 2007 after making racist and misogynist comments including describing the Rutgers women’s basketball team as “nappy-headed hos”.</p><p>Today’s sports broadcast world runs according to a new set of rules, in which “respectable” TV and the demi-monde of sports podcasts, streaming, and shitposting increasingly intersect: all engagement is good engagement, and the best type of filter is no filter. Whatever faint norms of decorum constrained earlier generations of professional sports talkers have faded completely.</p><p>There’s a reciprocal flow of testosterone and ideas between these shows, the world of sports, social media and real life. A handful of subjects and themes recur: veneration of the military, glorification of strength and traditional “male” values, celebration of gambling, the denigration of women and anything thought to represent “woke” culture. On any given day across the sporting bro-zone you might hear Bussin’ With the Boys and their guests rail against <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3xQvzNMgSsQ" data-link-name="in body link">pronouns</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI7wdtRqBKA" data-link-name="in body link">cancel culture</a>, the hosts of Barstool Sports’ Pardon My Take podcast <a href="https://x.com/BarstoolBigCat/status/1708865587332501776?lang=en" data-link-name="in body link">argue</a> Taylor Swift needs to “release a sex video” to make her presence at NFL games tolerable to the average male fan, or McAfee devote 30 minutes (as he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnIaepb9No" data-link-name="in body link">did recently</a>) to describing his day among “maybe the baddest motherfuckers on earth”: the drill instructors at the US Marine Corps training center on Parris Island in South Carolina. These interests and obsessions mirror the president’s cultural politics, turning the sports bros into critical emissaries for Trump’s peculiar brand of popularly elected vandalism.</p><p>It’s worth questioning, of course, how influential these influencers really are. A recent poll from the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/50th-edition-spring-2025" data-link-name="in body link">found</a> that 35% of young men had an unfavorable view of Rogan, while a further 36% had never heard of him or did not know enough about him to have an opinion. The much-rehearsed idea that the minds of young male voters have been irretrievably colonized by the manosphere is surely overblown.</p><p>But there seems little dispute that these influencers have been effective in platforming rightwing figures and ideas. The sports bros are an essential part of that legitimizing apparatus – all the more so because their endorsement of the right’s reflexes, priorities and modes of attack is couched in the ostensibly apolitical language of sports. The cultural supremacy of the sports bros is now so total that Barstool’s Dave Portnoy is now famous for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OneBitePizzaReviews" data-link-name="in body link">online pizza reviews</a> that can make or break restaurants in America. When a casual day trader from Massachusetts who built his media empire on college gambling advice becomes the arbiter-in-chief of America’s favorite food, something fundamental has shifted in how we determine cultural authority.</p><hr><figure id="5fb61f6a-d392-4bc8-a10b-e221b925e306" data-spacefinder-role="thumbnail" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c794e0c4dd68d58e839076c10c0556bcf0f8ed/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c794e0c4dd68d58e839076c10c0556bcf0f8ed/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c794e0c4dd68d58e839076c10c0556bcf0f8ed/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=120&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c794e0c4dd68d58e839076c10c0556bcf0f8ed/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=120&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a football as a microphone" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c794e0c4dd68d58e839076c10c0556bcf0f8ed/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=120&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="120" height="212.51475796930345" loading="lazy"></picture></div></figure><h2 id="the-sports-bro-supremacy">The sports bro supremacy</h2><p>The unsinkability of these sporting mouths, bobbing forever on the surface of our cultural consciousness, parallels the envenomation of online discourse and the transformation of Trump from <a href="https://youtu.be/n9mzJhvC-8E?si=phzLshtyeloXY7jj&amp;t=558" data-link-name="in body link">presidential punchline</a> into the most consequential political figure of the century. Trump, let’s not forget, first reached the White House after navigating a storm of outrage over the Access Hollywood tape, a victory that set a precedent for the practitioners of “locker room talk” who have found fame in his wake. With the tacit endorsement of the sports bros, on whose shows he became a regular guest during last year’s election, Trump not only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/us-election-donald-trump-voters-gender-race-data" data-link-name="in body link">seized</a> the young male vote, he also engineered a complete reversal in his own reputation throughout the sporting world from his first to second terms.</p><p>Interestingly, McAfee himself declined an invitation to have Trump on his show during last year’s election campaign, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/pat-mcafee-reveals-why-neither-trump-or-harris-appeared-on-his-show/ar-AA1tvg8x" data-link-name="in body link">reasoning</a> that he and his sidekicks are “not the ones” to be asking questions about politics – an uncharacteristic moment of modesty. But UFC-adjacent comedian Theo Von and Barstool Sports’ Bussin’ With the Boys both featured extended conversations with Trump during the campaign.</p><p>These appearances showed Trump to be extremely well-versed in sports, which is perhaps no surprise when you consider the amount of time he spends <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/donald-trump-slams-stupid-nfl-215717937.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMxvsRyiRWEQO8-AO9NRrBnnmQBXvo4Bqwil3pz8aLMUu0AGs8OkoMnFlkyAwovAQ2J-lOKc53oasDCAT0ACS79lE6Jv2JB6qvlNFvJhngtnbiPsfgV3h0k6t0Aiwz55u3MS6NkS8h46q72FOBpysYaRxxgf-Uvws2UOS6rOKVc2" data-link-name="in body link">tweeting</a> about them, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/gallery/president-trump-attends-ufc-316/" data-link-name="in body link">watching</a> them and <a href="https://trumpgolftrack.com/?fbclid=IwY2xjawLd1M9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFuSGdMUWZiWWtJeWFQQnYyAR4usIlL1CaYnd2ibvSPpWM81hutqW-FJY02kUdXKH1A6YnZSc1Tiqg7glwROQ_aem_ggKpTAl9yCroY2JOWb1HTA" data-link-name="in body link">playing</a> them – not to mention his own tangled history with the business side of sports (Trump owned a New Jersey-based team in the short-lived United States Football League during the 1980s). These podcasts also helped humanize Trump, presenting him as a relatable guy who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yl_zWSxpqLk" data-link-name="in body link">works long hours</a> and is sympathetic enough to engage a jumpy figure like Von in a conversation about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jqtUjMeY1-M" data-link-name="in body link">drug addiction</a>. The warm audience Trump received helped normalize his politics and support.</p><p>Today the sporting world, with a few notable exceptions, genuflects before Trump in a way that seemed unthinkable during his first term. Beyond the unquivering Trumpian stronghold of Dana White’s UFC, the big professional leagues such as the NFL and NBA either kept their distance from the 45th president or were at outright war with him;

The death of consequences for figures like McAfee suggests the balance of power has definitively swung in favor of the trolls and tough guys, and now none of puritanical old America’s sanctities will hold them back. It says everything about the sports bros’ invincibility that among the top names floated by progressives to counter the blitzkrieg of Trump’s second term and lead them to 2028 is Stephen A Smith, the sports pundit who turned relentlessness into a career and is something of a spiritual godfather to the McAfees and Portnoys of the world. The only person who can defeat a sports bro is another sports bro.</p><p>Might there be another strategy for the left to combat this tide flooding the sporting-cultural zone? Recent reports suggest Democrats are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/democrats-influencers-trump.html" data-link-name="in body link">slinging money</a> to all corners of the country in a desperate attempt to find the progressive answer to Rogan: the chatter is all about <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25955887-sam-plan/?q=Sports&amp;mode=document#document/p6" data-link-name="in body link">“speaking with American men”</a> and investing to generate a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/democrats-influencers-trump.html" data-link-name="in body link">“return on culture”</a>, and Democrats such as Hakeem Jeffries and Josh Shapiro have in recent months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/democrats-sports-podcasts-male-voters.html" data-link-name="in body link">zombied</a> from sports podcast to sports podcast in a doomed and focus group-refined attempt to revive a cadaverous Democratic party with the tonic of their everyman cool.</p><p>These appearances might be wooden and inauthentic, but it does suggest a key role for sports in the left’s attempt to pull itself off the canvas following the catastrophe of last November. Sports are hardly the exclusive preserve of the right. The Golden State Warriors’ four-time championship winning head coach, Steve Kerr, is probably the <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/steve-kerr-trump/" data-link-name="in body link">most vocal critic of Trumpism</a> at work in American sports today, and Democrats have long associated themselves with sports: Barack Obama, of course, is an accomplished hooper, while Zohran Mamdani, the socialist candidate for New York City mayor who loves <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/zohran-mamdani-podcasts-music.html" data-link-name="in body link">Arsenal</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/19/zohran-mamdani-andrew-cuomo-new-york-city-mayor" data-link-name="in body link">cricket</a> and has spun his appearances at Knicks games during the recent NBA playoffs into <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKQwgOxuteY/?hl=en" data-link-name="in body link">campaign trail gold</a>, is living proof that it’s possible to be passionate and knowledgeable about sports while eschewing the ugliness of bro culture.</p><p>But left-leaning sports pundits? That’s a tougher ask. The pallor of recent attempts to seed a more robust progressive presence online highlights how severely Democrats have been left behind in the new world of sports talk. Broadcasts such as the Pat McAfee Show are powerful engines of political orientation not because they address politics directly – they almost never do – but because their politics emerge in the interstices of everything said on screen.</p><p>There aren’t many popular voices in sports punditry that do for the left what McAfee and his cohort do, casually yet masterfully, for the right: embody an ethos, solidify an idiom and transmit a set of values that find a natural downstream outlet in electoral politics. Influential Twitch lefty Hasan Piker occasionally discusses sports but they are not his main focus; pundits such as Pablo Torre and Bomani Jones lean liberal but they do not have the same reach that the McAfees of the world do, and they don’t express their politics with anything like the same splash. Over the past decade sports broadcasters who discussed politics from a leftist perspective, such as former ESPN host <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/media/2022/08/05/jemele-hill-opens-up-leaving-espns-conservative-culture/10249552002/" data-link-name="in body link">Jemele Hill</a>, were gradually forced out of the mainstream. NFL star Travis Kelce, who hosts a popular podcast with his older brother Jason, seems vaguely progressive in orientation but he also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/nfl/kelce-honored-have-trump-super-bowl-despite-history-with-swift-2025-02-05/" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> playing in front of Trump at this year’s Super Bowl was “a great honor”, a tellingly wimpy political intervention. Like LeBron before him, he’s too big to get too real, too good to get dirty; the Kelce-James brand of progressivism is very much by the book, a progressivism of the civics class. Where the right is loud, the sporting left speaks with a militant squeak.</p><hr><figure id="3c8becbd-1a20-4c69-b963-eec01c0c618f" data-spacefinder-role="thumbnail" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-6"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5ed1a762b7ee85b2cae7cf31c739b34a014d4b2/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5ed1a762b7ee85b2cae7cf31c739b34a014d4b2/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5ed1a762b7ee85b2cae7cf31c739b34a014d4b2/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=120&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5ed1a762b7ee85b2cae7cf31c739b34a014d4b2/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=120&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a baseball as a microphone" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5ed1a762b7ee85b2cae7cf31c739b34a014d4b2/0_0_1694_3000/master/1694.png?width=120&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="120" height="212.51475796930345" loading="lazy"></picture></div></figure><h2 id="a-lack-of-voices-on-the-left">A lack of voices on the left</h2><p>On-field athletic competition is about domination, strength, winners and losers, yes, but it’s also about finesse, beauty, cunning and wit; it’s a place where conservative fantasies of order and the cerebrations of the progressives can both find a home.</p><p>But if any side should be controlling the field of sports talk, it is the left, since so many of the inequalities that plague society at large now infect sports as well, which are increasingly run on extractive lines for the benefit of predatory rentiers, autocrat-backed sovereign wealth funds and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/02/cold-ravenous-and-predatory-private-equity-is-slouching-towards-the-nfl" data-link-name="in body link">private-equity ghouls</a>.

A culture used to crew necks can’t go back to buttoned collars.</p><p>For example, as part of his deal with ESPN, McAfee is allowed to swear live on TV: “The following progrum is a collection of stooges talking about happenings in the sports world,” announces a disclaimer that airs before each show, read aloud in a geriatric voice reminiscent of Grampa Simpson. “There may be some ‘cuss’ words because that’s how humans in the real world talk.” This is one area where the bros and the left should make common cause: swearing is good. Viewers love McAfee not despite the fact he’s loose, unpolished and has a dirty mouth; they love him because of these things. This is a man, let’s not forget, who first came to prominence at age 23, while playing for the Colts, after being arrested in downtown Indianapolis for taking a pre-dawn swim in a canal. Asked to explain why he was soaking wet, McAfee <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colts-pat-mcafee-cuffed-for-drunken-canal-swim/" data-link-name="in body link">replied</a>: “I am drunk.” The charge was dismissed but the hearts of a city were won, and a media career was born.</p><p>Why can the left not take the best of McAfee and his ilk while jettisoning the worst? Surely it’s possible to talk sports in a way that’s biting, real, unfiltered, funny and even mean – to “connect with men where they are”, as we are repeatedly told the left must – without descending into toxicity, cruelty, belligerence and hate. If progressives want to reclaim the White House, they could do worse than to start rambling for hours on end about games and players that have nothing to do with politics at all. Sports-loving leftists of America, unite: you have nothing to lose but your parlays.</p></div></article></div>
