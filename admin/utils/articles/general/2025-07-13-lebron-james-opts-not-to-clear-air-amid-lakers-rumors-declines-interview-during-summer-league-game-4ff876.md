<p>Paul has been the liaison between James and the media since the Lakers' season ended early in the playoffs. His client's decision to opt-in means Los Angeles is cash-strapped a bit in terms of potential further roster enhancements and spending power in free agency.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p><span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-free-agency-tracker-latest-moves-player-rankings-as-lakers-sign-deandre-ayton/" target="_blank">The Lakers signed Deandre Ayton this month</a></span> and are bringing back <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3041402/jaxson-hayes/">Jaxson Hayes</a> on a one-year deal for further center depth. Beyond that, there's been no splashy roster additions after losing <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2248003/dorian-finney-smith/">Dorian Finney-Smith</a> to the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/HOU/houston-rockets/">Houston Rockets</a> other than signing forward <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3142186/jake-laravia/">Jake LaRavia</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Luka Dončić is <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-luka-doncic-extension-talks-with-lakers-may-take-longer-than-expected/" target="_blank">eligible to sign a long-term extension</a></span> in August since he was traded at the February deadline. If he wants to stay with the Lakers, Dončić could sign a four-year, $228 million extension.</p><p>Many have wondered <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-smart-business-comes-into-play-for-teams-interested-in-lebron-james-trade/" target="_blank">what a possible "smart business" trade market for James</a></span> would look like given his salary, age and idea of getting him on a possible one-year rental. At&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-trade-rumors-ranking-all-29-teams-as-possible-destinations-if-the-king-and-the-lakers-break-up/" target="_blank">what extreme would another team be willing to exhaust assets</a>&nbsp;to land James? For now, that's not a question that's on the table after Paul said James has not told the Lakers he's looking to move on.</p>
        

<p>The 40-year-old James averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebonds per game last season, his 22nd in the NBA.&nbsp;</p>
