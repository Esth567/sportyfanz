But the day belonged to Marc Márquez as he marked his latest triumph at his favourite hunting ground by standing on his bike and doing a jig as he passed the chequered flag – a fourth straight weekend where he has won both the sprint and the race.</p><p>“One more [win at the Sachsenring] was super special. From the beginning, I felt good, the confidence when I started the weekend was super high because we were coming from three victories in a row,” Marc said. “We are in an incredible moment. Now we can say that half the season is done, [but] we still need to be super concentrated.”</p><figure id="779035ba-6aaf-41cf-9081-0b9738920cfd" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbd8afa96c7e59dd3908a2cae0a2aba44ecb89e4/6_0_2448_1958/master/2448.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbd8afa96c7e59dd3908a2cae0a2aba44ecb89e4/6_0_2448_1958/master/2448.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbd8afa96c7e59dd3908a2cae0a2aba44ecb89e4/6_0_2448_1958/master/2448.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbd8afa96c7e59dd3908a2cae0a2aba44ecb89e4/6_0_2448_1958/master/2448.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbd8afa96c7e59dd3908a2cae0a2aba44ecb89e4/6_0_2448_1958/master/2448.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbd8afa96c7e59dd3908a2cae0a2aba44ecb89e4/6_0_2448_1958/master/2448.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Marc Márquez congratulates brother Álex Márquez after they finished first and second." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbd8afa96c7e59dd3908a2cae0a2aba44ecb89e4/6_0_2448_1958/master/2448.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="355.9272875816994" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Marc Márquez (right) congratulates his brother, Álex Márquez, after they finished first and second.</span> Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>Marc Márquez had clinched his seventh pole position of the season on Saturday before winning a wet sprint despite a mistake at the first turn, but this time he had the dream start to take the lead into turn one ahead of Bezzecchi and Di Giannantonio. As he slowly but surely started to stretch his lead, the two Italians swapped places while Álex Márquez and Pedro Acosta fought for fourth on the sweeping corners. Acosta became the third rider to crash early on after Lorenzo Savadori and Miguel Oliveira, with the young Spaniard gesturing at his fallen machine in frustration.</p><p>Di Giannantonio had broken the lap record in Friday’s practice and given the championship leader a tough time early in the sprint. But the Italian was unable to push any harder to catch up to Márquez Sr, who found a comfortable rhythm and pace to surge more than two seconds ahead, despite easing off the throttle on two laps to conserve his tyres.</p><p>As the lead stretched to more than three seconds, Di Giannantonio’s challenge came to an end on the downhill braking zone on turn one when he lost control and crashed, with his bike tumbling across the gravel while he escaped unhurt. LCR Honda’s Johann Zarco, who started second on the grid before getting pushed down the order, crashed at the same turn seconds later.</p><figure id="4f63f59a-c1b8-46ec-8b1c-d26fbb0a40cf" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7becd53c53a5db3d85b3f3d0b1767ca72e5e8844/264_0_2641_2113/master/2641.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7becd53c53a5db3d85b3f3d0b1767ca72e5e8844/264_0_2641_2113/master/2641.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7becd53c53a5db3d85b3f3d0b1767ca72e5e8844/264_0_2641_2113/master/2641.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7becd53c53a5db3d85b3f3d0b1767ca72e5e8844/264_0_2641_2113/master/2641.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7becd53c53a5db3d85b3f3d0b1767ca72e5e8844/264_0_2641_2113/master/2641.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7becd53c53a5db3d85b3f3d0b1767ca72e5e8844/264_0_2641_2113/master/2641.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Marco Bezzecchi is checked over by race stewards after crashing out." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7becd53c53a5db3d85b3f3d0b1767ca72e5e8844/264_0_2641_2113/master/2641.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356.03369935630445" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Marco Bezzecchi is checked over by race stewards after crashing out.</span> Photograph: Gold &amp; Goose Photography/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Bezzecchi had moved up to second but the Aprilia rider also bit the dust on the very next lap at turn one, moving Álex up to second while Bagnaia suddenly found himself in the podium positions.

It’s unbelievable to be here [after surgery].”</p><p>Yamaha’s Fabio Quartararo finished fourth ahead of Álex’s Gresini Racing teammate, Fermin Aldeguer. The next race of the season takes place in a week’s time – the Grand Prix of Czechia, with MotoGP returning to Brno after a five-year absence.</p></div></div>
