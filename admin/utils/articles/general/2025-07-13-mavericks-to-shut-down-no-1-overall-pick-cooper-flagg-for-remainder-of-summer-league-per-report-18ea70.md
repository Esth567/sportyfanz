        <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29556534/cooper-flaggs/">Cooper Flagg's</a> summer league days are over, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNPMuseo55Q" target="_blank">according to Marc Stein</a>. The <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/DAL/dallas-mavericks/">Mavericks</a> are expected to shut down the No. 1 overall pick for the remainder of the Las Vegas Summer League, which means the next time we'll see him in game action will be during the preseason.</p><p>Flagg played two games with Dallas' summer league squad, and he ended it on a high note after a mixed bag debut performance. In Flagg's second game, he racked up 31 points on 47% from the field in a loss to the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/SA/san-antonio-spurs/">San Antonio Spurs</a> and No. 2 overall pick <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29557116/dylan-harper/">Dylan Harper</a>. Flagg's 31 points were the most by a No. 1 pick in the Las Vegas Summer League since <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1755192/john-wall/">John Wall</a> in 2010, and was the perfect example of why he's considered a generational prospect.</p>
<p>He knocked down a couple triples, attacked the rim and showed off his mid-range game a bit, and while Dallas didn't win the game, it was a positive way to end Flagg's summer league time after a debut performance that by his own admission didn't live up to his standards. In that game Thursday, in front of a packed Thomas &amp; Mack Center who were intrigued by the matchup between Flagg and 2024 second-round draft pick <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29234638/bronny-james/">Bronny James</a>, the former Duke phenom struggled to score with efficiency, going 5 of 21 from the floor for just 10 points, though he also did record six rebounds and four assists in the win against the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAL/los-angeles-lakers/">Lakers</a>.</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cooper-flagg-scores-nearly-half-of-mavericks-points-in-summer-league-showdown-with-no-2-pick-dylan-harper/" target="_blank">

<p>Flagg's second performance was far more indicative of the type of player he is: one who can score off the bounce, can be an off-ball threat and someone who you absolutely don't want to lose in transition otherwise you'll end up on the wrong end of a highlight finish. Defensively, he showed in both games how much of a menace he can be on that end, especially from a shot-blocking perspective, as he can use his length and athleticism to fly out to shooters on the perimeter to alter shots, or come over as a weak side help defender to get a block near the rim.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>With everything Flagg showed on the defensive side of the ball, teams should be worried about the dangerous combination he's going to create with the likes of <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1992786/anthony-davis/">Anthony Davis</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/28951880/dereck-lively-ii/">Dereck Lively II</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2892001/daniel-gafford/">Daniel Gafford</a> next season. Flagg's offensive impact may take some time to develop on a veteran-led roster that's already built to contend for the playoffs with multiple All-Star candidates present, but he showed in summer league that he's capable of filling whatever role is needed of him on both sides of the ball.</p>
