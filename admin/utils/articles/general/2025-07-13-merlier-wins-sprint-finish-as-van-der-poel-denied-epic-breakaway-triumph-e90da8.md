The pacing was quite high at the front, but it was hard for all the guys -  the bunch was nervous," said Soudal Quick-Step rider Merlier.</p><p>"In the end we just went all in and I'm happy I can win my second stage here."</p><p>There has been debate in recent days about the long-term value of flat sprint stages in the Tour, which can unfold in predictable fashion, with the interest confined to the final stages.</p><p>Chateauroux, which was dubbed 'Cavendish City' in honour of Sir Mark, who took the first of his Tour-record 35 career stage victories here in 2008, has long been the preserve of sprinters.</p><p>However, Van der Poel's valiant attempt to end that streak and the race for position in the wind broke the race apart.</p><p>And the Dutchman revealed afterwards that he had embarked on the two-man expedition because team-mate Rickaert had a dream that he has now achieved after winning the day's combativity award.</p><p>"We wanted to go for it today because it's his dream to be on the podium of a Tour de France," Van der Poel said. </p><p>"It's hard not to be able to finish it off but we put up a good show today."</p><p>There was no change at the top of the general classification, with defending champion Tadej Pogacar remaining 54 seconds clear of Remco Evenepoel. </p><p>Two-time winner Jonas Vingegaard is fourth, one minute 17 seconds off yellow.</p><p>It was not all plain sailing for Pogacar and UAE Team Emirates, as the three-time champion's key lieutenant Joao Almeida abandoned the race as a result of injuries suffered on stage seven, with his absence likely to be felt in the mountains.</p><p>On Monday, the race takes in eight categorised climbs on Bastille Day as it travels 165.3km from Ennezat to Le Mont-Dore Puy de Sancy in the Massif Central.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>1.
