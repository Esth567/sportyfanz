        <p>The NASCAR Cup Series has placed an added emphasis on road racing in recent years, but Sonoma Raceway has been a fixture on the NASCAR schedule since 1989, and the only current road course with a longer history in NASCAR is Watkins Glen. On Sunday, Sonoma will host the 2025 Toyota/Save Mart 350. The race is scheduled for 110 laps around the 1.99-mile layout used for NASCAR, with the green flag dropping at 3:30 p.m. ET. This will be the third road or street race in under a month after the Chicago Street Race last week and NASCAR's Mexico City debut on June 15.</p><p>Shane van Gisbergen won both of those races and he's the +140 favorite in the 2025 Toyota/Save Mart 350 odds. Meanwhile, last year's winner Kyle Larson is listed at +600 in the NASCAR at Sonoma odds. Before entering any 2025 Toyota/Save Mart 350 picks, NASCAR DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, or locking in NASCAR props on sites like PrizePicks, Sleeper Fantasy, and Underdog Fantasy, be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-toyotasave-mart-350-odds-picks-projected-nascar-at-sonoma-leaderboard-predictions-by-top-model/#ttag=07092025_agg_cbssports_picks_autoracing_nascarcupseries_model_ToyotaSaveMart350" target="_blank">see the latest 2025 NASCAR at Sonoma predictions from SportsLine's proven projection model</a>.</p><p>Developed by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, this proprietary NASCAR prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times, taking into account factors such as track history and recent results.</p><p>McClure's model began the 2025 season by calling Chase Elliott's win in the Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray for a +300 payout. Then it went on to predict Kyle Larson in Miami (+350), Christopher Bell's NASCAR All-Star Race win (+600), Denny Hamlin's win in Michigan (+650), Shane van Gisbergen's win in Mexico City (+330), Elliott's win in Atlanta (+1500) and van Gisbergen again in Chicago (+150).</p>
        

<p>All told, the model has nailed seven winners this year and a whopping 25 winners since 2021. Anyone who followed its lead on <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">betting apps</a></span> and sportsbooks on those NASCAR picks could have seen huge returns. New users also have the opportunity to take advantage of the latest&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/bet365-promo-code/">Bet365 promo code</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/" target="_blank">FanDuel promo code</a></span> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanatics-promo-code/">Fanatics Sportsbook promo code</a>.</p><p>Now, the model simulated the 2025 Toyota/Save Mart 350 10,000 times. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-toyotasave-mart-350-odds-picks-projected-nascar-at-sonoma-leaderboard-predictions-by-top-model/#ttag=07092025_agg_cbssports_picks_autoracing_nascarcupseries_model_ToyotaSaveMart350" target="_blank">Head to SportsLine to see the complete projected NASCAR at Sonoma leaderboard</a>.</p><h2>Top 2025 Toyota/Save Mart 350 predictions</h2><p>For Sunday's 2025 Toyota/Save Mart 350, the model is high on Christopher Bell, even though he's a +1800 longshot in the latest 2025 NASCAR at Sonoma odds from BetMGM. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday and first-time users can also get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if their first bet loses with this <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/" target="_blank">BetMGM promo code</a></span>.</p>
        

<p>He didn't have a particularly good showing in the Chicago Street Race last week (24th), but he won in Austin and was second in Mexico City, so his road race setup is dialed in. Three of the 30-year-old's 12 career victories in the NASCAR Cup Series have now come on road courses, and he's started to get more comfortable at Sonoma in recent years.</p><p>After finishing 24th and then 27th in his first two Cup races at Sonoma, he's finished ninth in the last two races there. Underrated has kind of been the story of Bell's career, so it's not surprising that he's an underdog here, but considering that there are only a handful of drivers in the NASCAR Cup Series with multiple road wins, this is an incredible value play.</p><p>The model has also revealed a shocking NASCAR prop for Sunday after nailing an AJ Allmendinger top 10 prop (+120) last week: Ty Gibbs finishes top five for a +200 payout at Caesars. He's potentially a strong value pick for your Sonoma NASCAR prop bets, and you can also double your winnings on your next 10 bets after your first $1 bet with this <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/" target="_blank">Caesars Sportsbook promo code</a></span>.</p>
        

<p>The grandson of Pro Football Hall of Famer and team owner Joe Gibbs was the NASCAR Cup Series Rookie of the Year in 2023 and then made the NASCAR playoffs in his second full-time season. However, he's got work to do if he's hoping to race in the postseason again in 2025, as he's 66 points behind Bubba Wallace for the final playoff spot, and the bubble is still shrinking with every first-time winner.</p><p>That puts him on the verge of needing a win to get in, and a road course might be his best chance of doing that. He finished second last week in Chicago and also led 27 laps in Mexico City before going on to finish 11th, so he should have a setup that allows him to run towards the front. He's qualified top 10 at Sonoma the last two years, but finished 18th and 37th, respectively. He did manage a fourth-place finish at Sonoma in the NASCAR Xfinity Series in 2023 and led 26 of the first 50 laps in 2024 before a crash ended his day.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-grant-park-165-odds-picks-projected-nascar-chicago-street-race-leaderboard-predictions-by-top-model/#ttag=07022025_agg_cbssports_picks_autoracing_nascarcupseries_model_ChicagoStreetRace" target="_blank">See which other drivers to avoid and the rest of the projected NASCAR leaderboard at SportsLine</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 NASCAR at Sonoma picks</h2><p>The model is also targeting two other drivers with Sonoma NASCAR odds of 16-1 or longer to make a serious run at the checkered flag.
