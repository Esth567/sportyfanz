It was his bobblehead day, meaning the first 10,000 fans to walk through the gates at Target Field would receive a replica of Buxton doing his "Buck Truck" home run celebration.</p><p>"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous before the game started, just knowing it was bobblehead day," Buxton said. "Obviously you want to come out and do something good."</p><p>Buxton did more than something good. He became the first player to hit for the cycle at Target Field since the ballpark opened in 2010, helping ignite the Twins to a <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/game/_/gameId/401696336/pirates-twins">12-4 win</a> over the Pirates.</p><p>It was the 12th cycle in Twins history and the first since <a data-player-guid="ddce8b46-7c9e-20b5-7e99-56723808563b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32525/jorge-polanco">Jorge Polanco</a> had one in 2019.</p><p>Buxton had three hits through three innings -- a single in the first, a triple in the six-run second and a double in the third. After singling again in the fifth, he had one more opportunity in the bottom of the seventh.</p><p>Buxton, who will participate in next week's Home Run Derby in Atlanta, crushed a 427-foot solo homer off Pirates reliever <a data-player-guid="d29f257c-2b4a-fcbc-3a30-a5914381e53f" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32672/andrew-heaney">Andrew Heaney</a> with two outs in the seventh to make it an 11-3 game and complete the cycle. That brought the Target Field crowd to its feet, with many fans celebrating with Buxton bobbleheads.</p><p>With his team holding a comfortable lead, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli almost took Buxton out of the game before his final at-bat, he admitted afterward. Thankfully for Baldelli -- and Buxton -- a few coaches reminded the skipper what was at stake.</p><p>"He was 4 for 4 at the time. But with everything going on during a game, sometimes I'll be the one that might miss on a hitting streak or something that's going on with a particular player," Baldelli said. "But once they reminded me of that, he was going to stay in the game. He was going to get another at-bat, regardless of the score, and give him a chance to do something great."</p><p>The homer was Buxton's 21st of the season, tied for fifth most in the American League. With two runs driven in Saturday, Buxton now has 55 RBIs on the season -- just one shy of his single-season high. He boasts an OPS of .921 and is 17 for 17 in stolen bases.</p><p>"It's one of the greatest first halves I've ever witnessed," Baldelli said.</p><p>Buxton was replaced in center field after the seventh inning, but not before getting a standing ovation curtain call from Twins fans. He also received a Gatorade bath courtesy of teammate <a data-player-guid="53b65b61-99f4-b102-24c1-7138251ddd24" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35591/ty-france">Ty France</a>, who was headed to the clubhouse before realizing that nobody had doused Buxton yet after the game.</p><p>"It's special," Buxton said. "To be able to come out on bobblehead day like this and have a day like this is something I won't forget."</p>
