        <p>Longtime major leaguer Jimmy Rollins may be tied for 45th at the American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament on Lake Tahoe, but he was a big winner Saturday. Rollins nailed a hole-in-one on the par 3 12th hole and won himself a luxury MasterCraft X24 speedboat, which are valued up to $380,000.</p><p>"I got my first hole-in-one and won a boat," Rollins said with a big smile after his hole-in-one.</p>
<p>This is the third straight year a pro athlete won a boat with a hole-in-one at ACC. Former Raiders wide receiver Tim Brown did it last year, and Golden State Warriors legends Steph Curry did it the year before that.</p><p>Rollins, 46, played parts of 17 MLB seasons from 2000-16, including the first 15 with the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/">Phillies</a>. The 2007 NL MVP retired with 2,455 hits, 231 home runs, and 470 stolen bases. Rollins won a World Series ring with the 2008 Phillies and won four Gold Gloves at shortstop. Next year will be his fifth on the Hall of Fame ballot. He got 18% of the vote in 2025.</p>
        

<p>Former NHL player Joe Pavelski and soccer player Taylor Twellman entered Sunday with the lead at the ACC, a charity event featuring 90 celebrities. The ACC is held at Edgewood Tahoe Resort on the shore of Lake Tahoe in Nevada.</p>
