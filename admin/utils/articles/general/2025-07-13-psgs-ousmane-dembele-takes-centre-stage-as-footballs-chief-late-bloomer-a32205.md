At the end of Paris Saint-Germain’s destruction of Real Madrid in the semi-final of the Club World Cup in New Jersey this week, the coach declared his No 10 the season’s best player “by far”; not so much for the 35 goals and 16 assists but for something more simple. So simple it has taken a decade to do. But then Didier Deschamps, his national team manager with France, did say that being late is “a little habit of his”. Well, it was.

The semi-final had been virtually decided inside nine minutes, PSG scoring twice. Both times, Madrid made mistakes, Raúl Asencio and Antonio Rüdiger allowing the ball to escape them: not much, but enough. Both times, Dembélé was alert, on to them in a flash, sneaking up and then: <em>bam</em>. Like antelope narrated by David Attenborough, before they realised what had happened, Madrid’s defenders were done. “Scary,” Jürgen Klinsmann called it.</p><p>“They didn’t let Inter breathe, not even for one moment,” said the Germany World Cup winner, who is analysing the tournament with Fifa’s technical study group. “They suffocate you from the first second; they get on to the pitch and get at you. Against Madrid, yes, the two goals were mistakes but they were forced; it’s a high press with such energy, so aggressive it’s scary.” And it starts with Dembélé. “I would give the Ballon d’Or to Mr Ousmane Dembélé, for how he pressed,” Luis Enrique said after the Champions league final. “<em>That</em> is leading a team.”</p><p>“I haven’t always been like that,” Dembélé admits.</p><p>He was always different: explosive, entirely two-footed, unpredictable. There is a reason Thomas Tuchel, his coach at Borussia Dortmund, had wanted him at Chelsea, Sunday’s final opponents. A reason too – as well as desperation after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/aug/02/neymar-psg-barcelona-lionel-messi" data-link-name="in body link">Neymar’s departure</a> for PSG, admittedly – that Barcelona spent €145m on him.

When Dembélé departed two years later, the anger was about the way he went not the fact that he went: there was talent, everyone knew that, but the truth was that he had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/everyone-a-loser-messy-saga-ousmane-dembele-barcelona" data-link-name="in body link">largely irrelevant</a> and they didn’t lament his leaving.

Moved into a central position, he has scored more this season than in the previous five put together. He has scored against Real Madrid, Liverpool, Bayern, Arsenal, and Manchester City. His role was decisive in the Champions League final and the Club World Cup semi-final. He was Ligue 1’s top scorer. You shouldn’t buy Ballon d’Or winners, you should make them, Luis Enrique said, and perhaps he has.</p><figure id="a1d4ed61-f6bf-45a2-8b68-f006b0fbbfaa" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement"><gu-island name="GuideAtomWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;e218c1ea-eb69-4703-8286-95f2a3182fe6&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Winning the lot&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>Should PSG beat Chelsea, they will join an esteemed list of elite European clubs – Celtic, Bayern Munich, Barcelona (twice), Ajax and PSV  – to have won every men’s competition they have participated in during a  season.

At <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Barcelona</a>, Gerard Piqué joked that the team’s WhatsApp group was a handy reminder for a kid “is always late”, and Deschamps said Dembélé should be “careful” about his timekeeping. But even in private conversations where others feared that the Frenchman could not apply the intensity demanded by a manager who can be extreme, when frankly they wondered if he was too lazy, unlikely to offer the commitment required, the coach was convinced. There could be criticism for others, but there was always a defence of Dembélé. Yes, it could be – is – like he is on his own planet sometimes, but there was a player in there.</p><p>“Dembélé has always been a phenomenon,” Luis Enrique said. “The thing is, you have to go deeper to get the best version of Ousmane.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-16" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p><em>His </em>version. Aggressive, relentless, chasing everything. “It’s not just the goals or the decisive passes, it’s his overall impact that makes the team win trophies,” Luis Enrique said. “He has shown he is a step above. He is our best player, someone who can make the difference, because he has convictions.” It is that part of his game – the collective contribution rather than the individual, the press rather than the goals – that the coach returns to repeatedly.</p><p>Yet they are not mutually exclusive; in fact they are mutually dependent. Dembélé is looked after, embraced, trusted and made to feel important as well as being made aware of his obligations, the demands. For a coach who is extremely strict, who likes working with young players because they are faster, hungrier and almost always more malleable, it is also about letting go, complicity, a connection. About warmth and support, belief. With Dembélé, who at 28 is among the oldest at PSG now, the relationship is especially close.</p><p>Until the joking stops. “The best thing I did was leave him out against Arsenal,” Luis Enrique said after he had felt the need to punish his player for indiscipline. “I had to take a hard decision but I thought it was the best for the team and I would do it again a hundred times. We have had to do and say difficult things.</p><p>“Ousmane is a leader, but in what he does, not with words. Have you seen how he pressed? Tell me a No 9 in Europe who presses the goalkeeper and the centre-backs like that.

PSG play with two full-backs joining the rotation and movement through midfield, players carrying the ball all over the pitch, and forwards who are all dribblers – “dribblers are scarce but we have five of them,” Luis Enrique said. That creates an environment that works for the players, Dembélé especially.</p><p>“You have a false 9, a wide player, two-footed, who can go both sides, who has the freedom and mobility to find pockets of space,” Portugal’s coach, Roberto Martínez, said. “[But] when you analyse Dembélé, you have to start not at the end, with him, but the beginning. PSG work so hard to get players ahead of the ball, to give passing lines. People talk about them working off the ball but it’s also with it: players offer to receive, don’t get it, keep moving, offer again, don’t get it, keep moving. They are relentless. They have a high volume of quality chances and they work incredibly hard for that. It’s a whole lot of work, a whole lot of belief, an extreme belief and players who love to play that way.”</p><p>They love it because it pays off, so it becomes self-perpetuating, reinforced with every win. And then there’s something simple: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/05/paris-saint-germain-psg-bayern-munich-club-world-cup-culture" data-link-name="in body link">fun, enjoyment, engagement</a>. “It’s very easy to find the words to say it, but actually doing it is harder, [yet] that’s the key to everything we do,” Luis Enrique said. Klinsmann said: “As a striker it is a system you love. It is fascinating, because it’s also about chemistry: you can only play this kind of football if everybody, everybody, buys into it. If there is even one who doesn’t, the moment you have one not committing, not getting into people’s faces, you are going to fail.”</p><p>Why do players buy into an idea, why is Dembélé doing things he hadn’t before? Because of everything, and because he <em>likes</em> it. The man who was always the last to arrive is now always the first, so sharp, so quick, so alive that other footballers don’t see him coming until he’s gone.</p></div></div>
