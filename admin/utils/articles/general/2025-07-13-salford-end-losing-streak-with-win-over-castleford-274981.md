Jayden Nikorima went off with a wrist problem, Marsters dislocated his shoulder as he scored the try which re-established the Salford lead and both Loghan Lewis and Chris Hill needed head injury assessments.</p><p>Coach Paul Rowley had talked about seeing "green shoots" as they ran Warrington Wolves close last week, but he then lost half-back Danny Richardson, recalled from loan by Hull Kingston Rovers, and was forced to patch up his squad once more.</p><p>Cas have been poor this season and McGuire paid the price for that last week as he was dismissed after less than nine months in charge.</p><p>They were off to a bad start at the Salford Community Stadium too, as winger Ryan put the home side ahead after just nine minutes.</p><p>It looked like a familiar story for Salford, however, as Simm levelled and then Asi cut back inside the scrambling cover after a scrum in front of the posts to open up a 10-4 lead for the visitors.</p><p>Wilson then came up with two big moments at either end of the field, managing to force a knock-on over the line from Jeremiah Simbiken as he was poised to score, and then forcing his way over for a try of his own to level up the match once more.</p><p>Salford rediscovered the kind of flair that took them to fourth place last season as Marsters set up Hankinson for a try which put them six points up at half-time, but two quick penalties at the start of the second half brought the pressure from which Asi scored a try, with Chris Atkin's conversion making it 16-16.</p><p>Salford might have folded a few weeks ago but they came strong again as Marsters finished after a great break by Jack Ormondroyd and then debutant Olly Russell, brought in on loan from Wakefield Trinity this week, kicked through for Hankinson to score.</p><p>Lawler's late try cast some doubt over the result but Salford fought hard to maintain the lead, sparking celebrations from their support at the end, although they remain bottom of the table.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Relieved-happy-embarrassed-reaction" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'Relieved, happy, embarrassed' - reaction</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Salford coach Paul Rowley told BBC Radio Manchester:</b></p><p>"It feels good for the fans, the club, everybody, the back office and obviously the most important people, the players who did the job in tough conditions.</p><p>"We never like to do it easy, and losing Jayden (Nikorima) and Esan (Marsters) who were playing really, really well and playing the second half with only one interchange was really tough.</p><p>"It's a weird one. I don't know if I'm more relieved, happy or a little bit embarrassed because we've won a game and it's ended up like a cup final.</p><p>"I'm just grateful I have a group of lads, those who have been here a long time or those who keep coming in, but the character within the club is very contagious, and it was there to see."</p><p><b>Castleford interim coach Chris Chester told BBC Radio Leeds:</b></p><p>"We started the game really well. We wanted to challenge their middle and play direct through that middle third because we thought we could generate some ruck speed, but I'm just disappointed with the errors that we're making, and our resilience when we do make those errors.</p><p>"We look so flimsy at times, defending those shifts. They were making me nervous every time they got down there.</p><p>"It was just a disappointing, ill-disciplined performance from our guys. Collectively they are working hard but we just find ourselves saying the same things week in, week out.</p><p>"There are changes to be made at the club and there will certainly be changes with the playing roster and with the head coach. It's got to hurt, we're representing the Castleford club and the town and what we're dishing up lately is not good enough."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Salford:</b> Brierley, Ryan, Hankinson, Marsters, Connell, Nikorima, O.
