"I'm living my dream."</p><p>Sinner, who served a three-month doping ban earlier this year, has claimed the fourth Grand Slam title of his career and a first major victory not on a hard court.</p><p>A composed and clinical performance from the top seed ended Alcaraz's 24-match winning streak.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The manner in which he served out victory from going a break up at 3-1 in the fourth set - given his experience in Paris last month - was admirable.</p><p>There was a moment of knowing consternation among Sinner's supporters when he missed a first match point, but he reset to take his second opportunity before dropping to his haunches at the net.</p><p>Sinner's win stopped 22-year-old Alcaraz from becoming only the fifth man in the Open era to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles.</p><p>"It is always difficult to lose, but first of all I have to congratulate Jannik again," Alcaraz said.</p><p>"It is a really well-deserved trophy.
