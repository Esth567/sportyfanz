He is the first Italian player to win a Wimbledon singles title.</p><p>Sinner and Alcaraz have divvied up the past seven Grand Slam trophies, and nine of the last 12. Fittingly, this marked the first time the same two men faced off in the title matches at the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year since <a data-player-guid="6bf3e1d1-c102-93e9-a4e9-32ba6e82f887" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=425">Roger Federer</a> and <a data-player-guid="f091e8bf-f001-4687-0448-4b009dd966e8" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=261">Rafael Nadal</a> did it in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It hadn't happened for more than a half-century before that trilogy.</p><p>Sinner led 4-2 early in the match, but Alcaraz reeled off four straight games to snag the first set. In the second, Sinner broke Alcaraz in the opening game and held serve the rest of the way -- this despite being interrupted by a fan in the stands popping open a champagne bottle as Sinner was getting ready to serve out the game at 2-1 up. The cork landed at Sinner's feet.</p><p>Sinner broke Alcaraz for a 5-4 lead en route to claiming the pivotal third set, firing seven aces after having 0 across the opening two sets.</p><p>While serving at 4-3, 15-40 in the fourth set, Sinner faced two break points. But he calmly took the next four points to hold there, and soon was serving out the win. When it ended, Sinner put both hands on his white hat. After embracing Alcaraz at the net, Sinner crouched on court with his head bowed, then pounded his right palm on the grass.</p><p>The 532-day span between Sinner's 2024 Australian Open and Wimbledon victories is the second shortest by any man to win his first four majors, after Federer (434 days from 2003 Wimbledon to 2004 US Open).</p><p>Alcaraz stepped into the sunlight bathing Centre Court as the owner of a career-best 24-match unbeaten run and having defeated Sinner five times in a row. Alcaraz had won 20 consecutive matches at the All England Club, including victories against <a data-player-guid="4a27bb1c-2422-55c3-208b-9e9d8c1f30af" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=296">Novak Djokovic</a> in the 2023 and 2024 finals, and his .921 win percentage on grass (35-3) in his tour-level career was the best by any man in the Open era.</p><p>The last man to beat Alcaraz at Wimbledon? Sinner, in the fourth round in 2022.</p><p>Wearing the same tape job and white arm sleeve to protect his right elbow that he has been using since falling in the opening game of his fourth-round win against <a data-player-guid="16641195-ec8b-a983-e046-3f768b99ff28" href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1287">Grigor Dimitrov</a>, Sinner never showed any issues, just as he had not while eliminating 24-time major champion Djokovic in the semifinals.</p><p><em>ESPN Research and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>
