Trossard, 30, has been linked with a transfer to Fenerbahce and <a data-clubhouse-guid="a0bc2139-6270-6732-54a7-a49929b07c85" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=655">Saudi Arabia</a>, as the Gunners close on a £50m move to bring in <a data-clubhouse-guid="c43a00b9-2826-72b3-77a0-62730abc936e" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=363">Chelsea</a> winger <strong><a data-player-guid="e8393d3a-a2e5-b262-f720-eccb7252e525" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/293236/noni-madueke">Noni Madueke</a></strong>. Liverpool don't want to let Diaz leave and have reportedly already rejected a £50m bid for him from Bayern, with the German club ready to switch focus if need be.</p><p>- Manchester United forward <strong>Marcus Rashford</strong> is increasingly likely to become a Barcelona player due to the costly and complex nature of any possible move for Liverpool's <strong><a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257390/luis-diaz">Luis Díaz</a></strong>, according to <a href="https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/formula-barca-fichar-rashford-119637803" target="_blank">Diario Sport</a>. The <em>Blaugrana </em>have taken significant steps in negotiations with the 27-year-old <a data-clubhouse-guid="217dee4e-6974-a197-49a2-afda6e1788c9" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=448">England</a> international, but they are in no rush to close the deal while keeping negotiations open and moving at a good pace. Barça's preferred course of action would be to initially sign Rashford on loan, with an option to make the deal permanent. United would want a fee of €48m for Rashford this summer, but if Barça can loan him until the end of next season then he would only have two years left on his contract and would likely be available for less.</p><p>- Liverpool will make a £40m offer to <a data-clubhouse-guid="e8703d92-a160-9bbf-cb81-1be6f3fd7969" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=384">Crystal Palace</a> to sign center back <strong>Marc Guéhi</strong>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/35820705/liverpool-marc-guehi-transfer-bid-crystal-palace/" target="_blank">The Sun</a> reports. The club will then tell the Eagles to "take it or leave it" as they seek to put the pressure on. Guéhi, 25, has a big interest in moving to Anfield and is in the final year of his contract at Palace, while there is also interest from <a data-clubhouse-guid="feb44e87-58fa-9597-2691-b3c32768ebe4" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=359">Arsenal</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid="c43a00b9-2826-72b3-77a0-62730abc936e" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=363">Chelsea</a> and Manchester United.</p><p>- <a data-clubhouse-guid="35cb1790-1e9c-000b-fa70-640509f3c06e" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=929">Al Hilal</a> and two unnamed <a data-league-guid="9c1e0753-2757-3b78-a6ed-1b595caf8191" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ITA.1">Serie A</a> clubs have enquired about signing <a data-clubhouse-guid="3f4b2640-8af5-9785-93d5-363cbdb5a2f6" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=11420">RB Leipzig</a> striker <strong><a data-player-guid="3fb9e111-d7d7-72be-d04f-4cabdb2d50d7" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/289155/benjamin-sesko">Benjamin Sesko</a></strong> after Arsenal distanced themselves from signing him, according to <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/benjamin-sesko-transfer-news-al-hilal-serie-a-arsenal-decision-sources" target="_blank">TEAMtalk</a>.

Leipzig's demand of over €90m is making any transfer difficult for interested clubs, with <a href="https://tbrfootball.com/benjamin-seskos-agents-make-liverpool-move-after-arsenals-decision-to-sign-viktor-gyokeres/" target="_blank">TBR</a> reporting that Man United and Liverpool could step in.
