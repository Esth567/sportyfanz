Infantino moved out of frame of television cameras while Trump stayed put, finding himself squarely in focus as Chelsea captain Reece James lifted the trophy and his team-mates celebrated around him.</p><p>The final of the newly expanded tournament, ostensibly aimed at crowning a world champion of club soccer, kicked off at 3pm local time amid the searing heat that has been one of the storylines of the controversial competition so far. To the extent there was a US-specific connection in the matchup, it lay with Chelsea, owned by a group headed by American billionaire Todd Boehly, who joined Trump, Infantino and PSG chair Nasser al-Khelaifi on stage after the match.</p><figure id="4da4d269-6b00-4bea-837d-6c24af82318a" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-1"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Chelsea’s Reece James lifts the trophy as he celebrates with teammates and President Donald Trump, fifth from right, after Chelsea won against Paris St Germain in the Club World Cup final, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., Sunday, July 13, 2025." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004eaf5d319cf5885fb0cf0c08b16a0f58789721/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.8115234375" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Donald Trump stayed front and center as Chelsea lifted the trophy.</span> Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Security at the stadium was significantly elevated from previous matches held at the venue, with Secret Service agents posted at stadium gates.

The US national anthem, which had been played one hour before kick-off at every previous Club World Cup game as a regular part of the pre-game schedule, was moved up to take place just before the start of the game with Trump due to be present. When Trump was shown on stadium video boards standing for the anthem, the crowd reacted with booing for several seconds.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-7">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-7" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="f1048b29-4c8a-4e38-bee7-159a4304cd7c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:8,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Is the Club World Cup a good addition to the football calendar?&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;f1048b29-4c8a-4e38-bee7-159a4304cd7c&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/11/club-world-cup-football-calendar-tournament&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}"></gu-island></figure><p>Accompanying Trump in the midfield luxury box were Infantino, former New England Patriots quarterback and current Fox Sports commentator Tom Brady, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
