It's just about [the fact] I was able to play in it.</p><p>"So, right now I'm not bad at all. I'm just happy."</p><p>The two-time champion <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c5ykw5n0p7no">lost 4-6 6-4 6-4 6-4 to Sinner in an enthralling final</a> - a rematch of the epic French Open showdown in which Alcaraz bounced back from two sets down and inflicted a brutal defeat on Sinner just five weeks ago.</p><p>Alcaraz, a five-time Grand Slam champion at the age of 22, knows that these are still the early days of a growing rivalry between himself and the world number one.</p><p>Both players have only lost in major finals to each other. And both players know this is unlikely to be the last time.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Defeat-different-feeling-to-Olympics" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Defeat 'different feeling' to Olympics</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Almost 12 months ago Alcaraz lost the Olympic final in Paris to 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic.</p><p>It was a defeat he struggled to move on from.</p><p>"Last year in the Olympics I was really bad emotionally after the match. It was really, really hard for me to accept that moment," he said.</p><p>But Alcaraz has learned from that defeat, the most significant in his career up to that point, and says it is a "different feeling" this time around.</p><p>"I think in the last year I've been through enough different situations that I learned from them," he said.</p><p>"I just accept everything that is coming to me in the way it comes. Like, OK, I just lost a final in a Grand Slam, but I'm just really proud about being in a final."</p><p>That positive attitude and charisma has shone through at this tournament, with Alcaraz revelling in his status as a fan-favourite at the All England Club.</p><p>Opting to practise on the intimate outside courts rather than the official practice courts at Aorangi before his matches, huge crowds have gathered to catch a glimpse of him and he has also dined at local restaurants and mixed with fans.</p><p>On court he often plays with a smile on his face, even when behind in matches.</p><p>"I want to keep the good moments and try to forget the bad moments," he said.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Carlos Alcaraz interacting with fans on court 14 before the Wimbledon final" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/9004/live/552171f0-602f-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 976w" width="3840" height="2159.958049292082"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Alcaraz has practised on the outside courts at the All England Club, where he can interact with fans, including before the final on court 14 </p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Alcaraz-not-surprised-by-Sinner-resilience" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Alcaraz 'not surprised' by Sinner resilience</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Many would struggle to bounce back from a defeat like the one Sinner suffered at Roland Garros last month but the top seed did it in rapid and emphatic fashion to win a maiden Wimbledon title.</p><p>But Alcaraz said he was not surprised to see Sinner learn from that loss so quickly to win here.</p><p>"Champions learn from their - I'm not going to say failures - but they learn from the losses," he said.</p><p>"I knew at the beginning that he was going to learn from that final, not going to make the same mistakes as he did in the French Open final.</p><p>"The way he played today, it was really high. I knew he was going to play like this."</p><p>Alcaraz struggled with his first serve, finding it just 53% of the time, and he said it was also difficult to stay focused as Sinner pushed him hard with his supreme return game and dominance from the baseline.</p><p>"He was pushing me to the limit in every point," Alcaraz said.</p><p>"Mentally, sometimes it's really tough to maintain the good focus during the whole match when you see the opponent just playing such great tennis.</p><p>"At some points I didn't know what I had to do because from the baseline I was feeling he was better than me and I couldn't do anything about it."</p><p>On this occasion, to put it simply, Alcaraz lost to the better player on the day. He knows it. But he also knows this chance will likely not be the last.</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
