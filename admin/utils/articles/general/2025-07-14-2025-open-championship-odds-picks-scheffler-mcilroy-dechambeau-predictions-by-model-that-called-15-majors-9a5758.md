        <p>Royal Portrush was established in 1888 and it first hosted the Open Championship in 1951, but it would be 68 years before the oldest major championship in golf would return to the esteemed course in Northern Ireland. However, their wait has been much shorter this time around, as they'll host the 2025 Open Championship beginning on Thursday, July 17. Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau and Xander Schauffle are all golf superstars and they've combined to win six of the last seven major championships.</p><p>It comes as little surprise that they're all near the top of the 2025 Open Championship odds board. Scheffler is the +400 favorite (risk $100 to win $400) followed by McIlroy (+700) and Jon Rahm (+900), while Schauffele, the defending champion, is fifth on the board behind DeChambeau (+2000) at +2500.

In fact, the model is up over $8,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.</p><p>This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- and the 2025 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/" target="_blank">sports betting</a>&nbsp;picks could have seen massive returns on&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">betting sites</a></span>.

<p>Now that the 2025 Open Championship  field is locked in and fans are deciding where to bet the Open Championship, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-picks-odds-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-predictions-for-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-and-others/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipNames" target="_blank">Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard</a>.</p><h2>2025 Open Championship  predictions for Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau&nbsp;</h2><p>One shocker the model is calling at the Open Championship 2025: Rory McIlroy, a five-time major champion, stumbles this week and barely cracks the top five. The 36-year-old is now a five-time major champion and is one of only six golfers to complete the modern grand slam after winning the 2025 Masters. He's also the 2014 Open Championship winner, but he didn't fare well while facing enormous pressure at Royal Portrush in 2019.</p><p>The Northern Irishman missed the cut at the first Open Championship played in Northern Ireland in nearly 70 years despite being the betting and rooting favorite. He's also failed to crack the top five in each of the five solo events that he's played since winning at Augusta and missed the cut at last year's Open Championship.</p>
        

<p>The model has also locked in its projection for Scottie Scheffler, who is now a three-time major champion after winning the PGA Championship earlier this year. Scheffler didn't capture his first PGA Tour win until Feb. 2022 at the WM Phoenix Open, but he climbed to No. 1 in the world ranking later that season. Just 41 months later, he's now a 16-time PGA Tour winner and three-time major champion.</p><p>However, Open Championship golf has been a test for the American. In four career starts in golf's oldest major, Scheffler hasn't finished better than T-7, and he finished outside the top 20 in two of those attempts. He's also cooled off a little since recording his third win of the season at the Memorial Tournament, finishing T-7 at the U.S. Open and T-6 at the Travelers Championship.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the model has examined Bryson DeChambeau's chances of winning a third major. The 31-year-old has piled up 14 worldwide wins, and he's helped modernize the game in more ways than one, with single-length clubs, an analytical style and an army of social media followers. He's also become one of the biggest major championship threats in golf, with six top-six finishes in majors the last three seasons and two major wins.</p>
        

<p>However, he's coming off a missed cut at the U.S. Open, and he's also struggled to adapt to links golf. He's missed the cut in three of his seven career starts at Open Championships and has only recorded one top-25 finish, though it was a respectable T-8 in 2022. He's a different player since missing the cut at Royal Portrush in 2019, but will his playing style work in an Open Championship setting?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-picks-odds-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-predictions-for-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-and-others/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipNames" target="_blank">See the full Open Championship projections from the model here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship  picks</h2><p>The model is targeting five golfers with odds longer than 20-1 who will make a strong run at the Claret Jug.
