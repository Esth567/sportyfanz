        <p>Golf's final major of the year is set to tee off Thursday, July 17 as the 2025 Open Championship heads to Royal Portrush's Dunluce Links in Northern Ireland. It'll be a homecoming for Rory McIlroy, who will be looking for both his second British Open title and his second major win of the season after winning the Masters in April. The latest 2025 Open Championship odds via FanDuel list McIlroy as the second favorite at +700.</p><p>PGA Championship winner Scottie Scheffler is the +450 favorite in the latest PGA odds. Other top Open Championship contenders include Jon Rahm (+1200) and Bryson DeChambeau (+2000), with reigning British Open champion Xander Schauffele (+2500) and Ludvig Aberg (+2800) also in the mix. Scottish Open champion Chris Gotterup is a +9000 longshot.&nbsp;Before locking in your 2025 Open Championship picks, be sure to <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.</p><p>This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- and the 2025 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed its <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/" target="_blank">sports betting</a> picks could have seen massive returns on <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">betting sites</a></span>. New users have the opportunity to take advantage of the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/">FanDuel promo code</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/">DraftKings promo code</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanatics-promo-code/">Fanatics Sportsbook promo code</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Now that the 2025 Open Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>2025 Open Championship predictions&nbsp;</h2><p>One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Open Championship: McIlroy, a five-time major champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top five. McIlroy won The Open in 2014 but missed the cut in his last Open Championship start a year ago. He also missed the cut in his only other visit to Royal Portrush, which came at the 2019 British Open.</p><p>Since completing the career Grand Slam at the Masters earlier this year, McIlroy's form hasn't kept pace in his ensuing major starts or on the PGA Tour as a whole. He finished 47th at the PGA Championship and 19th at the U.S. Open, marking just the second time over the last dozen years he had finishes outside the top 15 in consecutive major starts. He's not a strong pick to win it all, and there are far better values in the 2025 Open Championship field.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">See who else to fade here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Another surprise: Justin Thomas, a 50-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The British Open has traditionally not been the strongest event for Thomas, who is still looking for his first career top-10 finish in this tournament.</p><p>Thomas, however, has been playing some of his best golf of the past few years recently. He won the RBC Heritage, a Signature Event, in April. He also recorded top-10 finishes at the Travelers Championship and the Truist Championship since that point. The model has identified him as a top-10 contender at Royal Portrush, making him a strong pick for Open outright and top-10 bets.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">See who else to pick here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>The model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 22-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">You can only see the model's picks here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
