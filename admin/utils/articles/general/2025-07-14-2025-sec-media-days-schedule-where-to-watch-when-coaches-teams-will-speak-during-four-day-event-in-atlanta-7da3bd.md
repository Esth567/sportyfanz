        <p>Talking season is in full swing as SEC personnel are set to descend upon Atlanta this week for 2025 SEC Media Days. From July 14 to July 17, the league's coaches will either get through their allotted time slot as quickly as possible, or they will take their chance to hype their respective teams just over a month before the season gets into full swing.&nbsp;</p><p>Though there are no new schools, or even new coaches, entering the league in 2025, there's still plenty to look forward to. Few names will demand as much attention as <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/">Texas</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/">Arch Manning</a>, who will travel with coach Steve Sarkisian to represent the Longhorns in Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><p>Manning, a former No. 1 overall recruit and scion of one of the most notable football families to ever grace the game, is entering his much-anticipated first season as Texas' starter. He is also one of 11 expected starting quarterbacks that will be present at SEC Media Days.&nbsp;</p><p>Texas is one of several SEC teams that are expected to be in the mix for a 12-team <a href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">College Football</a> Playoff, though the conference will be hunting for its first national title since 2022. It will be fascinating to see if <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/">Alabama</a> improves from its somewhat disappointing nine-win campaign in its first year under new coach Kalen DeBoer, or how <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/">Tennessee</a> -- which lost starting quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123367/nico-iamaleava/">Nico Iamaleava</a> to the transfer portal late in the spring -- follows up its first playoff appearance in program history.&nbsp;</p>
