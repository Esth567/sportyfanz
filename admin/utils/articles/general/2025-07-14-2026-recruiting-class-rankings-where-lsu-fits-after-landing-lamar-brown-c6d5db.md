Over the past week, three five-stars have announced their decisions, and 15 of the teams in the current top 25 secured at least one ESPN 300 commitment.</p><p>LSU used another in-state win to help boost its ranking as the Tigers were able to fend off Texas A&amp;M to keep local prospect <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256474/lamar-brown">Lamar Brown</a> at home. The No. 1-ranked recruit is projected to the defensive line, where he can use his agility, flexibility and motor to be a disruptive presence. He brings added value as he also could excel on the offensive line.</p><p>After breaking into the rankings last week, Alabama is on the rise by adding multiple four-star (or better) prospects. Five-star safety <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256347/jireh-edwards">Jireh Edwards</a> was one of those pickups; he gives the Tide a versatile defensive back with his blend of size, speed and physicality.</p><p>Oregon was a big mover despite the loss of an ESPN 300 commitment. The Ducks are the only team with three five-star prospects in their class, with OT <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259542/immanuel-iheanacho">Immanuel Iheanacho</a> the latest addition. A massive and powerful presence in the trenches who could transition at tackle or move inside and be a quick contributor at guard, he joins fellow five-stars TE <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256476/kendre-harrison">Kendre' Harrison</a> and safety <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256554/jett-washington">Jett Washington</a> in the class.</p><p>The list of undeclared ESPN 300 prospects continues to shrink, with only four of 23 five-star prospects still uncommitted. That list will likely be cut in half before July comes to a close, so big changes are still to come.</p><p>Here's a look at our latest top 25.</p><p><strong>New this ranking:</strong> Louisville</p><p><strong>Out:</strong> Minnesota</p><p><em>(Previous update: July 3)</em></p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png" width="100%"><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/30.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>1. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/30/usc-trojans">USC Trojans</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 18<br>
<strong>Top offensive prospect: </strong>OT <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/252293/keenyi-pepe">Keenyi Pepe</a><br>
<strong>Top defensive prospect: </strong>CB <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256616/elbert-hill">Elbert Hill</a></p><p>No program has more 2026 momentum than USC under Lincoln Riley, especially after hiring general manager Chad Bowden away from Notre Dame. The Trojans have double-digit ESPN 300 commits, with several joining the list since January. That includes two five-stars to start May in Pepe and Hill, and a pair of four-star commits who flipped from Big Ten rival Oregon: in-state defensive lineman <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256506/tomuhini-topui">Tomuhini Topui</a> and quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256697/jonas-williams">Jonas Williams</a>. Topui is a physical, aggressive defensive tackle who could develop into an interior pass-rushing headache for opposing offenses, and Williams is a true dual-threat signal-caller.</p><p>USC also made it a point to beef up in the trenches. It pulled four-star defensive tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/262373/jaimeon-winfield">Jaimeon Winfield</a> out of Texas, landed in-state defensive end <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256781/simote-katoanga">Simote Katoanga</a> and traveled to Utah to snag Corner Canyon offensive lineman <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259705/esun-tafa">Esun Tafa</a>. To further bolster the O-line, the Trojans landed Pepe out of IMG Academy. He is huge at roughly 6-foot-7 and 320 pounds, but is light on his feet as well as physical and can become a standout tackle. On the perimeter, they will not have to wait for in-state defender <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256651/rj-sermons">R.J. Sermons</a> as the ESPN 300 CB reclassified to 2025 and will join the Trojans this fall. For 2026, they pulled Elbert Hill, the top-ranked corner, out of the Midwest. Hill possesses elite speed, having been measured at over 22 mph in game play.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/61.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>2. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/61/georgia-bulldogs">Georgia Bulldogs</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 2</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 16<br>
<strong>Top offensive prospect:</strong> QB <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256473/jared-curtis">Jared Curtis</a><br>
<strong>Top defensive prospect:</strong> CB <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256384/justice-fitzpatrick">Justice Fitzpatrick</a></p><p>The Bulldogs have been a consistent staple among the top three overall classes during Kirby Smart's tenure and look to be a contender to do so again in 2026. A big step toward finishing near the top is bringing five-star quarterback Curtis back into the mix. After a decommitment, the Bulldogs were able to fend off other suitors, most notably Oregon, and give themselves a potential impact QB for the future. Curtis might need to adjust to a relatively steep jump in competition level, but he has elite physical tools, including a smooth, quick release and the ability to change arm angles.</p><p>With three of their top four pass catchers from 2024 having moved on and the fourth likely to leave after this season, Georgia is bringing in new receiving targets with speed. <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/265206/brady-marchese">Brady Marchese</a> has been recorded hitting over 22 mph in game play. After signing two ESPN 300 TEs in their 2025 class, the Dawgs continue to restock there, adding <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261348/lincoln-keyes">Lincoln Keyes</a>, who with his big frame and good body control can offer a wide catch radius.</p><p>On defense, the Bulldogs have had 11 first-round NFL draft picks over the past five years and they continue to infuse that unit with top talent, including two of the top DBs in the country in Fitzpatrick and <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/252291/zechariah-fort">Zechariah Fort</a>. Fort is a safety with good range who can be active in run support. Fitzpatrick is the younger brother of former Alabama great DB Minkah Fitzpatrick; his blend of size and speed gives him equally promising impact potential.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/87.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>3. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/87/notre-dame-fighting-irish">Notre Dame Fighting Irish</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 4</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 17<br>
<strong>Top offensive prospect:</strong> TE <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260060/ian-premer">Ian Premer</a><br>
<strong>Top defensive prospect</strong>: CB <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260154/khary-adams">Khary Adams</a></p><p>Notre Dame started the year off slowly on the recruiting trail but added several key ESPN 300 additions in the spring and summer months, including important defensive additions. <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259643/rodney-dunham">Rodney Dunham</a> was one of the first on board and is an edge player with a quick first step. The secondary will benefit from adding some length to that unit. <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256726/ayden-pouncey">Ayden Pouncey</a> is a rangy safety with a 6-foot-3 frame that could allow him to grow into an outside linebacker role. Khary Adams is one of the top cornerback prospects in the nation as he possesses an excellent blend of size (6-foot-2) and speed (21.3 mph max speed).</p><p>On offense, ESPN 300 OT <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256681/gregory-patrick">Gregory Patrick</a> joined a class that already featured several top offensive line prospects including top-10 tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256518/tyler-merrill">Tyler Merrill</a>, who at 6-foot-7 and 335 pounds is a massive presence with physicality and power in the run game. This group collectively can continue the school's strong reputation as an offensive line factory.</p><p>The Irish also landed <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256546/thomas-davis-jr">Thomas Davis Jr</a>., whose father is former Panthers star <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/242364/thomas-davis">Thomas Davis</a>, and four-star quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256607/noah-grubbs">Noah Grubbs</a>, who already has shown impressive footwork and a sound release from the pocket. Their QB of the future will benefit from multiple targets added in this class, including TE <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260060/ian-premer">Ian Premer</a>. Among the wide receivers in the group is high-three star <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/265006/devin-fitzgerald">Devin Fitzgerald</a>, the son of former NFL great Larry Fitzgerald. Like his father, he is a good-sized target at nearly 6-foot-2 and has shown to be productive, with more than 50 receptions and nine TDs as a junior.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/245.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>4. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/245/texas-a&amp;m-aggies">Texas A&amp;M Aggies</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 3</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 15<br>

<strong>Top defensive prospect</strong>: ATH <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/257193/brandon-arrington">Brandon Arrington</a></p><p>Mike Elko has quickly proved he can identify and recruit at a high level. He has worked fertile recruiting grounds outside his home territory, including Georgia, Florida, California. He went out west to land the nation's No. 1-ranked athlete Brandon Arrington, whose speed could allow him to have an impact on either side of the ball, though he projects to corner in College Station. He pulled out Georgia ESPN 300 DLs <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/155530/jordan-carter">Jordan Carter</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/252332/bryce-perry-wright">Bryce Perry-Wright</a> as well as landing fellow four-star defensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256684/jermaine-kinsler">Jermaine Kinsler</a> out of New Jersey.</p><p>The Aggies bolstered their rushing attack with a pair of in-state running backs in <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256560/kj-edwards">K.J. Edwards</a> and Jonathan Hatton, who has an excellent blend of size (200 pounds) and speed (he was measured hitting 21 mph on film). Edwards has been very productive in high school, rushing for 1,700 yards in each of his last two seasons.</p><p>Elko has also been able to unearth talent from more unlikely places, such as quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256533/helaman-casuga">Helaman Casuga</a> out of Utah. Casuga is not a big, physical prospect at roughly 6 feet, but he has a live arm and can get the ball out quickly. <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259666/victor-singleton">Victor Singleton</a>, one of the top prospects in Ohio, was a nice flip from Illinois. He has clocked a 21-mph max speed and has the type of quickness and excellent feet to thrive in man coverage at corner.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/333.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>5. <a data-clubhouse-guid="258022c1-fed4-a0ce-c017-1f853c81d1a8" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/333/alabama-crimson-tide">Alabama Crimson Tide</a></h2><p><strong>Previous rank</strong>: 9</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits</strong>: 10<br>

<strong>Top defensive prospect:</strong> S <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256347/jireh-edwards">Jireh Edwards</a></p><p>It took some time for Alabama's class to find its footing, but an active June brought the Tide into the mix among the top classes in the country. They kept one of the top running backs in the class at home by landing Ezavier Crowell, an aggressive runner who possesses good power and vision.</p><p>The defense is benefitting from some big pickups, including pulling several ESPN 300 defenders out of Georgia. <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256776/xavier-griffin">Xavier Griffin</a> has a lengthy and broad frame to develop and can get up field and bend the edge. From the same high school (Gainesville), the Tide snagged DE <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259835/jamarion-matthews">Jamarion Matthews</a>, who has a stockier build but can also bend well and get after the quarterback.</p><p>They also added a pair of top-10 CBs in <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259693/jorden-edmonds">Jorden Edmonds</a>, also out of the Peach State, and in-state <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259156/zyan-gibson">Zyan Gibson</a>, who has posted consistent mid-4.4 40s on the camp circuit. The summer success continues into July as the Tide added five-star Jireh Edwards to their secondary. At roughly 6-foot-2 and more than 200 pounds with excellent testing numbers, Edwards can be a physical and versatile defensive back.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/194.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>6. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/194/ohio-state-buckeyes">Ohio State Buckeyes</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 5</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 13<br>
<strong>Top offensive prospect: </strong>WR <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256276/chris-henry-jr">Chris Henry Jr</a>.<br>
<strong>Top defensive prospect:</strong> S <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256480/blaine-bradford">Blaine Bradford</a></p><p>Ryan Day has the luxury of building his 2026 class around one of the most coveted players in the country: five-star receiver Henry, whose father, the late Chris Henry, was a star receiver for West Virginia and the Cincinnati Bengals. Henry Jr. stands 6-6 and has a combination of length and quickness rarely seen from high school receivers.</p><p>The rest of the Buckeyes' class has started to take shape around Henry. The team has added a handful of ESPN 300 prospects since March, including Bradford out of Louisiana and linebacker <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256642/simeon-caldwell">Simeon Caldwell</a> out of Florida. <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/262416/cj-sanna">C.J. Sanna</a> is a prospect we like on tape; he is a big, physical linebacker with excellent range and is a bit of an underrated pickup for this talented class. In-state offensive tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256484/maxwell-riley">Maxwell Riley</a> is impressive changing direction and finishes plays with the type of nastiness that will endear him to fans in Columbus.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/130.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>7. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/130/michigan-wolverines">Michigan Wolverines</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 7</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 12<br>
<strong>Top offensive prospect:</strong> QB <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256499/brady-smigiel">Brady Smigiel</a><br>
<strong>Top defensive prospect: </strong>DE <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259724/carter-meadows">Carter Meadows</a></p><p>The Wolverines signed the No. 1 QB for the 2025 cycle in <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/253546/bryce-underwood">Bryce Underwood</a> and he carries high expectations, but they continue to add talent to the position and landed ESPN 300 signal-caller Brady Smigiel. The onetime Florida State commit is not only an accurate passer, but he also plays with the confidence and swagger that will be needed battling with five-star Underwood.</p><p>After losing two DLs in the first round of the NFL draft, Michigan added several DLs to this class, including ESPN 300 DEs <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259642/titan-davis">Titan Davis</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259675/mchale-blade">McHale Blade</a>. Four-star DE <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256773/tariq-boney">Tariq Boney</a> is a player to keep an eye on. He lacks ideal length but can be a well-rounded technician and a quick contributor. In addition to pulling Boney out of the nation's capital, Michigan also landed Carter Meadows, a rangy edge defender who can bend well.</p><p>After scoring from off the beaten path with former standout TE <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/245589/colston-loveland">Colston Loveland</a> (Idaho), the Wolverines hope to strike big again from that same region with <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259696/matt-ludwig">Matt Ludwig</a> out of Montana. He is a versatile player with good ball skills who can be tough after the catch and fights for yards.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2390.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>8. <a data-clubhouse-guid="2b3657a5-caae-31a2-899a-0d09df0f7bed" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2390/miami-hurricanes">Miami Hurricanes</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 8</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 9<br>

They're coming off a 10-win season, former QB <a data-player-guid="9f4e87b5-5da8-38c0-9951-e3496b55b3c8" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4688380/cam-ward">Cam Ward</a> was the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft and they've reeled in two consecutive top-15 recruiting classes. Mario Cristobal's 2026 class is working to match or even exceed those groups.</p><p>The Hurricanes are adding pieces to field a dominant offensive line. They could lose several projected 2025 starters after this season but are adding big men who can step in and project a bright future in the trenches. In addition to landing the top-rated interior OL in the 2025 class, they have added several OLs to their 2026 class, led by No. 1 tackle Jackson Cantwell. Much like current standout OT <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/246626/francis-mauigoa">Francis Mauigoa</a>, who was a five-star himself and a Year 1 starter, Cantwell could step in at one of the tackle spots upon arriving in South Florida. He is a massive presence at roughly 6-7 and 320 pounds and carries his size well. In addition to being powerful, he possesses good quickness and flexibility, and much like Mauigoa is being projected to be a high NFL draft pick.</p><p>QB <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256711/dereon-coleman">Dereon Coleman</a> has room for growth but has a quick release and accuracy. The Hurricanes flipped from Georgia a speedy receiving target out of California in <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260039/vance-spafford">Vance Spafford</a>, who won the fastest-man competition last summer at the UA Future 50 event. Four-star Miami native Jordan Campbell is 6-2, 220 pounds with the versatility to make plays in pursuit and the bend and power that portend a potential impact pass rusher. He's a candidate to take a leap with college coaching.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2483.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>9. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2483/oregon-ducks">Oregon Ducks</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 23</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 9<br>

<strong>Top defensive prospect: </strong>S <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256554/jett-washington">Jett Washington</a></p><p>Dan Lanning's run of sustained excellence in Eugene rolls on with Oregon's 2026 class. Reeling in five-star tight end Kendre' Harrison in November set the tone. The 6-6, 250-pound tight end is a dynamic two-sport athlete with an exceptional catch radius and is a nightmare for opposing defenses in the red zone. The Ducks also added a five-star prospect to their defense with the big-framed and rangy Jett Washington. A fluid safety with good ball skills and the ability to win jump-ball battles, he can also be a physical presence in the secondary.

The 6-foot-7, 260-pound Mississippi native brings elite length, explosive traits and a relentless motor that was on full display at the Under Armour All-America week in January. Beating out LSU and Texas for McCoy marks a major recruiting win for Napier, and McCoy has the potential to develop into one of the SEC's most feared defensive linemen.</p><p>A late close helped the Gators rise in the past cycle, but they've ascended much earlier this time around with an active summer.

The Cougars currently hold commitments from two top-100 ESPN 300 standouts -- tight end Brock Harris and quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256646/ryder-lyons">Ryder Lyons</a>  -- marking what could be their most highly rated duo of high school signees in the ESPN 300 era dating to 2006).</p><p>Harris, a 6-foot-7, 240-pound in-state product, has transformed from a jumbo wideout into one of the nation's premier tight ends, adding size while retaining his fluid route-running and wide catch radius. He also brings toughness, having competed at the 2025 Under Armour All-America Game with a cast on his hand. If all goes according to plan, Harris will catch plenty of passes from Lyons, a four-star quarterback who won California's Gatorade Player of the Year award this fall. Lyons' commitment represents a full-circle win for BYU. The Cougars offered him as an eighth grader and held off the likes of USC and Oregon to secure his commitment.</p><p>Another ESPN 300 prospect, two-way lineman <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256547/bott-mulitalo">Bott Mulitalo</a>, committed in March and could be tasked with protecting Lyons down the road, adding to what has the makings of a historic haul in Provo.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2567.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>20. <a data-clubhouse-guid="1ca864c9-0072-57e4-6fbf-d333f53e4409" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2567/smu-mustangs">SMU Mustangs</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 13</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 5<br>

Capitalizing on the rich talent base in Texas, they have added several in-state prospects, including ESPN 300 back <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/262322/christian-rhodes">Christian Rhodes</a>. An explosive runner who has been recorded hitting better than 21 mph in game play, he rushed for more than 1,200 yards as a junior. To help clear running lanes, the Mustangs have added several offensive linemen, including Evan Goodwin, a massive presence at 6-foot-7 and 320 pounds, and in-state guard <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256676/drew-evers">Drew Evers</a>, a thickly built and strong blocker who can latch on and control defenders.</p><p>High three-star <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/262388/aljour-miles-ii">Aljour Miles II</a> is another nice in-state add, as he is a lengthy receiver with good quickness and body control. Another receiving target with big-play potential, <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261240/jakai-anderson">Jakai Anderson</a>, was pulled out of Louisiana. Not quite as big a target, he brings a good blend of speed and elusiveness and could also be productive in the return game. On defense, the addition of DE <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/266873/hudson-woods">Hudson Woods</a> is a big plus. Woods shows some savvy as a pass rusher, with active hands and good bend. LB Kenneth Goodwin out of California can be a physical player with the ability to rush the passer as well as make plays in coverage.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/26.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>21. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/26/ucla-bruins">UCLA Bruins</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 17</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 2<br>

In recruiting, the former running back knows the importance of a good O-line and pulled a pair of ESPN 300 OLs out of Florida in <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256531/micah-smith">Micah Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259691/johnnie-jones">Johnnie Jones</a>. Known as Champ, Smith was an Under Armour All-American as a junior and has shown he can play against top competition and be a well-rounded OT. Tight end <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256537/camden-jensen">Camden Jensen</a> should help propel the run game as well, as he is a good blocker.</p><p>The Bruins have added multiple WRs in this class, including in-state four-star <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256568/kenneth-moore">Kenneth Moore</a>.

A two-sport star who also excels on the hardwood, the ESPN 300 prospect projects to wide receiver, where he can be a playmaker with good hands and the ability to make defenders miss after the catch. Also from in-state, big man <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/262378/casey-thomann">Casey Thomann</a> is one of the top OL prospects in Illinois, and three-star Tony Balanganayi is an interesting big man.

Now he's pushing for more talent in 2026. They surprised many by beating several top programs, including Michigan, for ESPN 300 WR Calvin Russell, a lengthy but smooth target who plans to also play basketball with the Orange.</p><p>Four-star defensive end <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259104/jarius-rodgers">Jarius Rodgers</a>, also out of Florida, is among Brown's biggest gets so far. The 6-5 220-pounder has tremendous length and an impressive track background. He has considerable physical tools and upside if Syracuse's coaching staff can harness it. Wilson is another big pull out of Florida; the edge defender has good initial quickness and tallied 17 sacks in 2024.</p><p>OT <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259692/javeion-cooper">Javeion Cooper</a> has real upside too. He has good size (6-5, 300 pounds) yet plays with impressive balance for someone with his power and contact explosiveness. The Orange also have been active in the mid-Atlantic, landing three receivers from Delaware. Among that group is <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260478/bj-garrett">B.J.

Carter is a good route runner with strong hands and could be a quick contributor once arriving. Coke is a nice target at roughly 6-2.</p><p>On defense, <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/265106/joey-kopec">Joey Kopec</a> is a two-way player in high school, contributing at RB and LB.

He's an elusive, upright runner with the ball skills to affect the pass game and also has a baseball background; he originally committed to rival Kentucky as a freshman before pursuing football. QB Briggs Cherry has performed well during in-person evaluations, including winning positional MVP during the UA New Orleans camp in March, and the strong-armed passer has risen in the rankings, proving to be a key January pickup.</p>
