        <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/">San Francisco 49ers</a> wide receiver <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180514/jauan-jennings/">Jauan Jennings</a> wants a new contract with the franchise but is open to a trade if he is not compensated adequately, <a href="https://x.com/AdamSchefter/status/1944754723493437825" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to ESPN</a>. Jennings is in the final year of a two-year, $15.4 million extension that he signed with the 49ers in May 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Jennings followed that new deal up with a breakout season, as he stepped up for a San Francisco team that dealt with major injuries at the wide receiver position. Jennings emerged as a consistent starter after <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967489/brandon-aiyuk/">Brandon Aiyuk</a> tore his ACL and MCL in a Week 7 game against the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/">Kansas City Chiefs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In his expanded role, Jennings caught a career-high 77 passes for 975 yards and six touchdowns. A former seventh-round pick out of <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/">Tennessee</a>, Jennings is expected to maintain his starting role in San Francisco after the 49ers traded <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139735/deebo-samuel/">Deebo Samuel</a> to the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/">Washington Commanders</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jennings, who spent a majority of his rookie season in 2020 on the practice squad, logged seven starts from 2021-23. He also had just 963 yards and seven touchdowns through his first four seasons with the 49ers.&nbsp;</p><p>The pending contract dispute with Jennings is the first major speedbump that San Francisco has faced this offseason. The 49ers were able to sign star linebacker <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142098/fred-warner/">Fred Warner</a>, quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961306/brock-purdy/">Brock Purdy</a> and key tight end <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818265/george-kittle/">George Kittle</a> to <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/49ers-get-a-for-fred-warner-contract-extension-but-how-do-rest-of-splashy-offseason-moves-grade-out/" target="_blank">contract extensions without much hassle</a></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>In March, San Francisco also re-signed fullback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1683145/kyle-juszczyk/">Kyle Juszczyk</a> to a two-year contract worth $8 million after initially releasing him.&nbsp;</p>
