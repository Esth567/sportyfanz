"Even better because everyone doubted us before the game, we knew that. To put a fight on like we did, it's good. The gaffer put a great game plan out. He knew where the space was going to be. He tried to free me up as much as possible and I just had to repay him and score some goals."</p><p>Palmer, <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45735257/chelsea-cole-palmer-happy-silence-critics-cwc-win" target="_blank">who won the Golden Ball</a> as the tournament's best player, added:&nbsp;"I like finals. It's happened again."</p><p>Chelsea arrived in the U.S. after winning Europe's third-tier Conference League and on the back of a domestic campaign in which they managed just a top-four Premier League finish.</p><p>Prior to the match, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said he was expecting a "game of chess" against PSG coach Luis Enrique, but it was a quick checkmate for the Italian, who gave a tactical masterclass.</p><p>Maresca's team employed a relentless high press and emulated the tactics used by Brazilian outfit Botafogo, who had beaten PSG 1-0 in the group stage and were the only team to score against Luis Enrique's side in the previous eight games.</p><p>Their press caused PSG all sorts of trouble and when Maresca's side couldn't regain possession, they sat deep, frustrating the European champions, who were unable to play their usual game.</p><p>The direct and pacey soccer we had become used to seeing from PSG was Chelsea's game Sunday, with Palmer, Gusto and Joao Pedro picking apart the PSG defense, especially on the left side.</p><p>Other than an early golden opportunity for PSG's Desire Doue that was wasted, the first half was all Chelsea's and, after they opened their three-goal lead, the French side could never recover.</p><p>"Chelsea were more effective than us, they worked well on our slight weakness," PSG captain Marquinhos said.</p><p>"Tactically, they caused us problems in the first half and we took a while to react. These are things we'll need to change going forward. I think all teams will now study us closely to see what we do well and what we do badly. It's up to us now to always be at the top of our game."</p></div></div>
