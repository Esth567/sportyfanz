description: "Sergio Marchi likens Infantino to Roman emperor Nero  He says staging was reminiscent of ‘bread and circuses’  The president of Fifpro has described the Club World Cup as a “fiction” and compared Gianni Infantino to the Roman emperor Nero, as the dispute between the players’ union and Fifa continued to escalate. Sergio Marchi joined the ranks of those critical of Infantino’s expanded tournament, saying a “lack of protection” for players had left the Club World Cup equivalent to “bread and circuses”. It is understood Fifpro was not invited to a meeting regarding player welfare held by Infantino in New York on the eve of the final, won 3-0 by Chelsea against Paris Saint-Germain.

Fifpro last month urged Fifa to grant players a four-week rest between seasons. This request has not been taken up, however, with the meeting on Saturday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/fifa-mandatory-rest-periods-players-burnout" data-link-name="in body link">ending with an agreement</a> that three weeks of rest would be sufficient. “There is a consensus that there must be at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and that players should have a rest period/holiday of at least 21 days at the end of each season,” Fifa said.</p><p>Fifpro is part of a group of football bodies, including the Premier League, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/footballers-union-fifpro-legal-action-fifa-club-world-cup" data-link-name="in body link">pursuing legal action</a> against Fifa over an alleged lack of consultation regarding the Club World Cup and changes to the international match calendar more broadly.</p><p>The global governing body has said it is “fully within our rights to set the parameters of our competitions whilst respecting the regulatory framework in place”, and the prospect of a legal row was described by Infantino as “futile”.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-9">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-9" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Fifa said there had been agreement at the weekend’s meeting that the calendar needed to “strike the right balance between national team football and club football, on the one hand, and between domestic, continental, and global club competitions, on the other hand”.
