<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><h2 id="1-spain">1) Spain</h2><p>Spain were favourites coming into the Euros and, based on their form in Group B, they still are. They matched England’s Euro 2022 record of 14 goals in the group stage. Alexia Putellas is continuing her charge for the Ballon d’Or with three goals and four assists and has lit up their midfield while the 18-year-old Vicky López has impressed in her first major tournament. While in sensational form going forward, their defence does leave opportunities for their opposition. They will be favourites to win the quarter-final against hosts Switzerland but it will be a mouth-watering occasion in Bern.</p><h2 id="2-sweden">2) Sweden</h2><p>Sweden were undeniably impressive in the group stage. While Denmark caused them a few issues in their opening win, Peter Gerhardsson’s side truly got their title challenge up and running with a comprehensive victory over Poland and a demolition of Germany. That marked their first Euros win over the Germans in six attempts. Spreading goals around the team is a bonus but the defence remains their weakness, particularly when against pace. Nevertheless, they go into the quarter-finals unbeaten in 15 matches and full of confidence.</p><h2 id="3-france">3) France</h2><p>France caught the eye by outplaying England in their Group D opener and they look like a team on an unbeaten run. The manner of their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/netherlands-france-womens-euro-2025-match-report" data-link-name="in body link">comeback against the Netherlands</a> will only have helped their confidence. The strength of their wide play is second to none with Sandy Baltimore and Delphine Cascarino in good form. Their No 9 Marie-Antoinette Katoto has also opened her account for the tournament, putting to bed the ghosts of Euro 2022 where she suffered an ACL injury. As with many sides in this tournament, they have defensive frailties that can be exploited as all three opponents in the group showed.</p><gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=france&amp;player=20&quot;,&quot;scriptUrl&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Cascarino&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:2},&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;41e6ae36-a599-4f22-9cdf-4e08af3db35e&quot;,&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false}"><figure id="41e6ae36-a599-4f22-9cdf-4e08af3db35e" data-alt="Cascarino" data-testid="interactive-element-Cascarino" data-spacefinder-role="inline"><a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=france&amp;player=20">Cascarino</a></figure></gu-island><h2 id="4-england">4) England</h2><p>England started the tournament slowly with defeat by France but have started to click into gear. For Sarina Wiegman’s side it was more the manner of that opening performance that was disappointing, but they have since put things right. A couple of tweaks to their game plan and they scored a combined 10 goals against the Netherlands and Wales. Lauren James is showing exactly what she is about on this major stage while Ella Toone is playing some of the best football of her career. The Lionesses still look frail defensively, especially when faced with a strong transitional side.</p><h2 id="5-norway">5) Norway</h2><p>Progressing with three wins from three looks impressive but when you delve into Norway’s performances things look a little less rosy. Gemma Grainger’s side were expected to top Group A but they have struggled for cohesion. Switzerland and Finland both gave them a scare but the experience and quality of Ada Hegerberg and Caroline Graham Hansen came through. With Italy up next, they will feel they have a chance to progress deep into the competition.</p><figure id="4925b28e-dc60-411a-9460-e18955b11c9a" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Caroline Graham Hansen (middle) celebrates with captain Ada Hegerberg after scoring against Finland." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Caroline Graham Hansen (middle) celebrates with captain Ada Hegerberg after scoring against Finland.</span> Photograph: Mathias Bergeld/BILDBYRÅN/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><h2 id="6-germany">6) Germany</h2><p>The manner of their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/sweden-germany-womens-euro-2025-match-report" data-link-name="in body link">4-1 drubbing by Sweden</a> will have left a sour taste before the quarter-finals. Two wins from two before that meeting in Zurich got the job done for Christian Wück’s side but they have not looked convincing, particularly defensively. The loss of captain Giulia Gwinn to a medial ligament knee injury in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/germany-poland-womens-euro-2025-match-report" data-link-name="in body link">their opening victory against Poland</a> was a blow and they will now have to do without her back-up Carlotta Wamser for the next match after her brilliant impression of a goalkeeper earned her a straight red card.</p><h2 id="7-switzerland">7) Switzerland</h2><p>Football fever has swept through Switzerland as Pia Sundhage’s team progressed to the European Championship knockouts for the first time. The hosts’ prospects looked uncertain given their indifferent form, but they have impressed, their youthful side embracing the opportunities of a major tournament. Captain and centurion Lia Wälti continues to lead by example while Géraldine Reuteler has stood out with three Player of the Match winning performances. A dramatic injury-time equaliser from Riola Xhemaili against Finland to send them through only added to the fairytale.</p><h2 id="8-italy">8) Italy</h2><p>Andrea Soncin’s side were many people’s dark horses coming into the tournament, and without setting the world alight, they have impressed in reaching the knockouts for the first time since 2013. An edgy win over Belgium after a wonder goal by Arianna Caruso got their campaign up and running but was followed by a disappointing draw with Portugal, marked by wastefulness in front of goal. But they put in a strong showing in defeat by Spain, particularly in the first half, to show they can grow into the competition. A quarter-final encounter with Norway is a huge opportunity.</p><gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=italy&amp;player=18&quot;,&quot;scriptUrl&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Caruso&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:2},&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;6568dd89-5733-41b3-9d3a-a51f092dbe2d&quot;,&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false}"><figure id="6568dd89-5733-41b3-9d3a-a51f092dbe2d" data-alt="Caruso" data-testid="interactive-element-Caruso" data-spacefinder-role="inline"><a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=italy&amp;player=18">Caruso</a></figure></gu-island><h2 id="9-finland">9) Finland</h2><p>One of the surprise packages, Finland gained admiration for their inspired performances despite their elimination. An opening win over Iceland marked their first at a Euros in 16 years and represented a good achievement for Marko Saloranta and his side. Their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/06/norway-finland-euro-2025-match-report" data-link-name="in body link">performance against Norway caught the eye</a> despite defeat as they put Gemma Grainger’s team under significant pressure. The manner of the draw against Switzerland was heartbreaking – an injury-time equaliser from the hosts knocked Helmarit out – but this developing squad will take so much from the experience.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-21">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-21" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><h2 id="10-netherlands">10) Netherlands</h2><p>A campaign that started brightly soon descended into chaos. Their opening day win and the celebrations around Vivianne Miedema’s 100th goal seem like a distant memory after two dispiriting defeats by England and France. Group D was always going to be a challenge but to concede nine in two matches is a serious concern. There is disruption behind the scenes with Andries Jonker’s departure imminent – and there was a press room spat between him and a Dutch journalist. Then Daniëlle van de Donk initially said she had been fit after not starting against England, before backtracking, while the captain Miedema did not get on the pitch in their final match.</p><h2 id="11-belgium">11) Belgium</h2><p>Belgium’s performances did not reveal anything that was not already known about Elísabet Gunnarsdóttir’s side – strength in transition and dangerous in attack but leaky in defence and lacking structure. That counterattacking strength proved fruitful at times and they exploited Spain admirably before being dismantled at the other end of the field. A final-day victory over Portugal to avoid finishing last in Group C added a gloss and the 25-year-old forward, Mariam Toloba, was a stand-out performer throughout.</p><figure id="929efa32-1737-4d97-b47f-60c3220d9d70" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Mariam Toloba in action against Portugal." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.6923343138951" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Mariam Toloba in action against Portugal.</span> Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h2 id="12-poland">12) Poland</h2><p>Poland’s first major tournament will have given the coach, Nina Patalon, and her team plenty of learnings and memories as they look to build. They achieved a series of firsts – Natalia Padilla-Bidas made history with their first goal on this stage while they held off a Danish comeback to secure their first win in the final game. The opening performance against Germany was admirable despite defeat. It is an exciting time for the women’s game in Poland and this outing, however brief, will help.</p><h2 id="13-portugal">13) Portugal</h2><p>Francisco Neto’s side came into the tournament on a downward spiral that was made more emphatic by the manner of their emotional opening day defeat by Spain. There is no shame in losing to <em>La Roja</em> but the five goals conceded just illustrated how poor they have been defensively in 2025. Diana Gomes’s late equaliser against Italy provided one of the more dramatic games of the group stage. Perhaps a rethink is needed as they look to World Cup qualification<strong>.</strong></p><h2 id="14-denmark">14) Denmark</h2><p>Group C was always going to be tough for the Danes but this was their worst Euros performance. It can’t have helped that the manager, Andrée Jeglertz, was announced as Manchester City’s new manager on the eve of their first game. Denmark looked bright in spells but never really mounted a challenge and toiled when Pernille Harder was marked out of a game. They managed to salvage a little pride with late fightback against Poland but still succumbed to defeat and it proved too little too late. A sad ending to Nadia Nadim’s career.</p><h2 id="15-wales">15) Wales</h2><p>The lowest-ranked team in the tournament were always going to struggle in the Group of the Death. Rhian Wilkinson’s side did not get the luck of the draw in their major tournament bow. Despite three defeats, there will be plenty the Welsh can take back to Wales to try and back up this achievement. That their first goal in a European Championships was scored by Jess Fishlock seemed inevitable and the 38-year-old will now have a big decision to make about her future. Wilkinson pointed to the fitness gap between her side and the others while also making a rallying call to increase access to sport for girls in Wales.</p><h2 id="16-iceland">16) Iceland</h2><p>If Fifa World rankings are a real measure of a team, Iceland would have been the favourites in Group A despite registering one win since July 2024. However, Hildur Antonsdóttir’s opening-day red card set the tone for a difficult campaign all round for Þorsteinn Halldórsson’s side, that saw them defeated three times. A late rally against Norway gives hope for the future but there is an overreliance on the talent of Sveindís Jónsdóttir. The 20-year-old forward Katla Tryggvadóttir looked bright on her major tournament debut.</p></div></div>
