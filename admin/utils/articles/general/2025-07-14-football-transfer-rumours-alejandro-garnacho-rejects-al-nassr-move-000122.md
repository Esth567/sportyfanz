description: "Today’s fluff is propelled by a fan Alejandro Garnacho wants to leave Manchester United but is not too eager on moving to the Saudi Premier League, even if it means teaming up with Cristiano Ronaldo. Al-Nassr approached the Argentina winger to suggest a change of scene and a massive wage but Garnacho wants to play in Europe. The same reportedly goes for his United colleague Marcus Rashford, with the England forward waiting for Barcelona to make a bid. One United winger finally getting to leave permanently is Jadon Sancho, who has joined Juventus for £17.3m, only £60m or so less than they paid for him four years ago.  Continue reading..."

With the other options being Altay Bayindir, who wants to leave, and Tom Heaton, United may be forced to sign a new goalkeeper within their tight budget.</p><p>Aston Villa are preparing to sign a new second choice goalkeeper. With Emiliano Martínez’s future still up in the air <strong>Marco Bizot</strong> could arrive from Brest as backup and become No 1 by next month. The 34-year-old Dutchman arrived in England on Sunday and will reportedly move to Villa Park on a free transfer.</p><p>After luring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/call-me-trent-alexander-arnold-arrives-at-madrid-with-dreams-of-alonso-and-glory" data-link-name="in body link">Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid</a> from Liverpool, the Spanish side are trying to do the same with <strong>Ibrahima</strong> <strong>Konaté</strong>. The French centre-back has a year left on his deal at Anfield and that may bring a cheeky low offer. Konaté is said to be open to the move.</p><p><strong>Luis</strong> <strong>Díaz’s</strong> repeated links to Bayern Munich and Barcelona mean Liverpool are considering replacements. One potential recruit is Real Madrid’s Rodrygo. The Brazilian did not get many minutes under new head coach Xabi Alonso at the Club World Cup, something many see as a sign he is not fancied by the former Spain international. Arsenal were interested at one point but the imminent arrival of Noni Madueke from Chelsea should mean the end to their search for a winger. Meanwhile, reports in Germany suggest Bayern will target Arsenal’s Leandro Trossard if they fail to sign Díaz.</p><p><strong>Evan Ferguson’s</strong> next loan move away from Brighton will take him to Roma, where he has shaken hands on a season-long seal. The Irishman did not pull up any trees at West Ham, so will be hoping a new country will do him the world of good. Roma are also interested in signing Lens’ <strong>Neil El Aynaoui,</strong> who is also a target for Everton.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-8">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-8" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Nottingham Forest’s pursuit of PSV’s <strong>Johan Bakayoko</strong> could come a cropper because the winger wants to join a Champions League team.
