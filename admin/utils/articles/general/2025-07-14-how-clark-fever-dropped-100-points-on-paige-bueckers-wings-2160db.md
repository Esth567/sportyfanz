For a team that recently bemoaned its lack of consistency, the group has to be pleased with how it didn't let its foot off the gas facing the six-win Wings. The offensive output was particularly impressive, with 201 points tallied over the past two games. Coach Stephanie White has talked about the importance of stacking games like this, so the test now will be to finish out the pre-All-Star slate strong -- the Fever play at the <a data-clubhouse-guid="7c72e7ee-5064-b766-2b39-95b57e3d9a08" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/conn/connecticut-sun">Connecticut Sun</a> on Tuesday and at the <a data-clubhouse-guid="ad8ccde6-59b3-fbe6-2faf-a835fa224ca1" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-liberty">New York Liberty</a> on Wednesday -- and get multiple games above .500 for the first time this season.</p><p><strong>What the game means for the Wings?</strong> The Wings need to figure out their defense. It was tough to watch the way they were constantly beat in transition, particularly in the second quarter, by the Fever offense. Defense has been an Achilles' heel for Dallas this season, but coach Chris Koclanes was hoping his team would come out with more intensity on that end of the floor after giving up big nights to <a data-player-guid="c74956ad-2490-b3c4-0cef-485fb49da1a6" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/887/sami-whitcomb">Sami Whitcomb</a> and <a data-player-guid="baf2f1cb-234e-740a-0af2-c8a82626b685" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3102133/rebecca-allen">Rebecca Allen</a>. The opposite happened in the second quarter, where Indiana went on a 25-4 run that essentially decided the game.</p><p>Will <a data-player-guid="a35875ce-3ef4-61d5-9a20-483b82d82ed9" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3904577/arike-ogunbowale">Arike Ogunbowale</a> find a groove this season? She was 0-for-10 from the field in her first game back from a thumb injury, but she was struggling to get incorporated into the offense even before she missed time. It'll be interesting to watch how Koclanes' backcourt rotations evolve as the season progresses, with rookies <a data-player-guid="8414d14d-bade-316b-8e82-203de8c26582" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4433807/aziaha-james">Aziaha James</a> and <a data-player-guid="00fd5edf-6b2a-3da4-b07a-13657a4d9afd" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4434015/jj-quinerly">JJ Quinerly</a> seeing expanded roles in recent weeks.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45732670,whitelist-AU|AR|BJ|CF|FM|AM|MZ|TT|BS|VG|SC|BF|LS|NG|SL|AG|EC|LR|NA|MU|MW|CR|MX|SX|GM|GP|GW|BR|NI|BB|GN|NE|GY|UG|GD|SV|ZM|SN|US|AS|GU|MP|PR|VI|UM|GB|UK|CL|PY|ST|CO|GQ|KE|MH|MQ|NZ|VC|AW|TC|CU|CV|MF|BO|BM|CM|KM|BQ|PW|PA|ZW|SR|JM|UY|AI|PE|BZ|BW|MG|CI|SS|GT|TZ|FJ|CG|BI|GA|GF|MS|VE|TG|GH|LC|ER|RW|ET|ML|AO|SZ|HT|CD|KY|ZA|RE|KN|DO|HN|" data-cerebro-id="6873fc85f9cb241c51c4f855" data-title="Bueckers snatches rock from Clark, finishes with and-1" data-source="espn" data-contributing-partner="wsc"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fss_20250713_143550288_2894008%2Fss_20250713_143550288_2894008.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fss_20250713_143550288_2894008%2Fss_20250713_143550288_2894008.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fss_20250713_143550288_2894008%2Fss_20250713_143550288_2894008.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45732670">play</span><figcaption><p>0:21</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Bueckers snatches rock from Clark, finishes with and-1</p><p>Paige Bueckers snatches the ball from Caitlin Clark and takes it coast-to-coast for a Wings and-1.</p></div></div><p><strong>How did Clark and Bueckers play?</strong> Clark was proud of how she managed Friday's game against Atlanta (12 points, 9 assists) and she one-upped that Sunday with a 14-point, 13-dime effort, good for her fifth double-double of the season and 19th of her career. Her shooting still isn't quite as efficient as she'd like (4-for-12 from the field,  2-for-7 from 3), but Clark has reiterated that she's trying to stay confident in her abilities and in the work she has put in. Another positive from Sunday: Clark made her presence felt defensively with a team-best five steals.</p><p>Bueckers led all scorers with 21 points on 9-for-15 shooting (2-for-4 from 3), her 17th consecutive game notching double figures to start her career. Only three other players in league history -- <a data-player-guid="9d049a87-30bf-a718-0206-b47ef02f57df" href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3149391/aja-wilson">A'ja Wilson</a> (2018), Candace Parker (2008) and Natalie Williams (1999) -- have had longer such streaks. Turnovers were a bit of an issue for Bueckers (four, tying her career high) and the rest of the Wings (18), which led to the Fever thriving in transition offense. <em>-- Alexa Philippou</em></p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png" width="100%"></p><h2>Live coverage</h2>
