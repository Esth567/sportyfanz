Four demerit points in a 24-month period triggers a ban, with Siraj now on two after an incident in the second Test against Australia in Adelaide of December last year.</p><p>Match referee Richie Richardson deemed Siraj to have breached the International Cricket Council's code of conduct for "using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter upon his/her dismissal".</p><p>The incident came as part of a tetchy Test. Prior to the Siraj-Duckett clash, players exchanged words on the third evening when England opener Zak Crawley wasted time to ensure the home side faced only one over before the close.</p><p>A similar situation occurred on the fourth evening, this time with India nightwatchman Akash Deep trying to limit the amount of overs bowled before stumps.</p><p>Deep was ultimately bowled by England captain Ben Stokes with the last ball of the day, setting up a tantalising final morning on Monday.</p><p>India are 58-4 in pursuit of 193 on a difficult pitch. The tourists require 135 runs, England six wickets.</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
