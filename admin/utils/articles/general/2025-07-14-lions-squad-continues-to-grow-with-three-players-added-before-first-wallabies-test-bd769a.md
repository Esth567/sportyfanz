On that tour half a dozen players were called up primarily because of their geographical proximity rather than, in certain cases, on pure playing merit.</p><p>In this case, Sutherland was a Lion in South Africa four years ago where he played in six matches including two of the Tests, Graham was a strong candidate to make the squad in the first place, and Ashman has won the nod over Wales’s Dewi Lake.</p><p>Ashman, who plays his club rugby for Edinburgh, has won 28 caps to date and made his Scotland debut in November 2021 against Australia. Graham has played for Scotland for seven years and scored 31 tries in 47 Tests, although he was sent off at the weekend for collecting two yellow cards against Fiji.</p><p>No ban has been forthcoming, however, so the winger is free to join up with the Lions. The number of extra bodies being bussed in, nevertheless, again brings into question the logistics of modern day Lions tours with the management once more required to cobble together a team for midweek games sandwiched in between Test matches.</p></div></div>
