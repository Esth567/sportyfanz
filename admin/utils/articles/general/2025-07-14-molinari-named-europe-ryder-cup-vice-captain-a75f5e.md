"I really enjoyed being part of Luke's backroom team in Rome and trying to help the players.</p><p>"Luke is a very smart, switched on individual. It's been great to see at first-hand how much he is putting into being the captain. He did the same two years ago and he's doing it now. He leads by example so that passion trickles down to the players.</p><p>"It is going to be a big challenge at Bethpage. Everyone will give their best and I am very happy to be able to give my contribution to the team."</p><p>Donald added: "Francesco knows how to win Ryder Cups, having been on three winning teams, and I think that's really important for us. We obviously have a tough task ahead of us trying to win away in New York.</p><p>"I think he brings a very calm head. He is someone who listens a lot and has good ideas. He speaks up when he feels like he needs to.</p><p>"I love his demeanour. He just doesn't seem to get too flustered. He doesn't seem to get too high or too low. I think that's going to be important in a place like New York, an away Ryder Cup. So I love what he brings and I'm very excited that he's a part of the team again."</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
