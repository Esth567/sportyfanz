        <p>From humble beginnings in the Carolinas and across the Southeast, NASCAR has grown into not only the most popular form of auto racing in the United States, but also one that can attract the intrigue and attention of the rest of the world. And the places that NASCAR seeks to go, but also the place where it came from, is reflected in where its premier division will be racing in 2025.</p><p>The 2025 NASCAR Cup Series season features not only familiar stops from the superspeedways of Daytona and Talladega to the sport's most iconic tracks like Darlington, Charlotte and Martinsville, but also two new additions to the schedule both near and far away. The year began with Chase Elliott winning The Clash at the legendary Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, N.C., while Shane van Gisbergen would win at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, scoring the win in the first international Cup Series race in NASCAR's modern era and the first overall since 1958.</p><p>In just five short weeks, Shane van Gisbergen has gone from outside the top 30 in the Cup standings to near the top of the NASCAR playoff standings. The former V8 Supercars champion has taken full advantage of a summertime swing of road course races, earning three-straight road course wins at Mexico City, Chicago and Sonoma to tie Kyle Larson, Denny Hamlin and Christopher Bell as the winningest driver in Cup this season.</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nascar/news/nascar-at-sonoma-results-shane-van-gisbergen-remains-king-of-the-road-with-third-straight-road-course-win/" target="_blank">

<p>Among the other major changes to the remaining schedule this year include:</p><ul><li>Nashville  Superspeedway's race date moves from late June to the beginning of  June, immediately following the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte. Michigan and  Pocono return to June dates as well.</li><li>Sonoma and Dover's race dates have both been moved to July. Iowa Speedway's race date has been moved from June to August.</li><li>Mexico City's date has come at the expense of Richmond Raceway, which will now have just one race weekend in August.<br></li><li>Atlanta,  Watkins Glen and Homestead-Miami have been moved out of the playoffs,  with Gateway and New Hampshire moved into the playoffs instead. The  Southern 500 at Darlington has also returned to being the  playoff-opening race, and the Coke Zero Sugar 400 is once again the  regular-season finale after a scheduling quirk because the Olympic break pushed the season forward a week.</li><li>Talladega  Superspeedway's playoff race has been moved into the Round of 8, with  that race now set to potentially determine a place in the Championship  4.</li><li>In the Xfinity and Truck Series, the legendary Rockingham  Speedway has returned to the schedule in both series for the first time  since 2004 and 2013, respectively. The Truck Series also gains an  entirely new racetrack with NASCAR's first-ever trip to Lime Rock Park  in Connecticut.</li></ul><h2>2025 NASCAR Cup Series schedule</h2><p>(* -- Denotes non-points
