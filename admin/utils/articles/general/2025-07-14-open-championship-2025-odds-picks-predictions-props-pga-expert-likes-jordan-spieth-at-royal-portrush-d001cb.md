        <div><p>It's been over a decade since a British golfer won the British Open, courtesy of Rory McIlroy in 2014. However, the 2025 Open Championship field is loaded with golfers from the United Kingdom who could end this drought. From a Scot like Robert MacIntyre to Englishmen such as Matt Fitzpatrick and Justin Rose to an Irishman like McIlroy, Brits have a good chance to win this major for the 67th time in history. Meanwhile, Americans are seeking their 48th Open Championship victory and third in a row, as Scottie Scheffler is the +450 favorite, per the 2025 Open Championship odds, to make it a three-peat for the United States.</p><p> McIlroy has the best Open Championship odds amongst U.K. golfers at +700, with Englishman Tommy Fleetwood at +2800 and MacIntyre at +3500. Other heavy favorites to utilize in 2025 British Open bets include Jon Rahm (+1200), Bryson DeChambeau (+2000) and the defending champion in Xander Schauffele (+2500). The Open 2025 will begin on Thursday, July 17 from Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland.

He's hit eight major outright winners since 2013. In the fall of 2022, he hit outright winners in three consecutive weeks: Russell Henley (40-1), Tony Finau (18-1), and Adam Svensson (150-1). This season, he's already hit Hideki Matsuyama (22-1), Harris English (110-1), Ludvig Aberg (25-1) and Ben Griffin/Andrew Novak (25-1) in New Orleans.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who followed his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/" target="_blank">sports betting</a>&nbsp;picks could have seen massive returns on&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">betting sites</a></span>.

It was back in June when he finished seventh at the Memorial, which was his third top-10 of the season. He had three consecutive top-20 finishes between the Valero Texas Open, The Masters, and the RBC Heritage. Finally, he was impressive in finishing 23rd last month at Oakmont."</p>
        

<p>Spieth, the 2017 British Open champion, has had as much success at this major than any other. It's the only in which he's never missed a cut, going a perfect 11 for 11, and he has eight top 25s over his last nine Open Championship starts. That includes five top 10s over the last decade, and he held his own at the 2019 Open at Royal Portrush, sitting in eighth place entering the final round before heavy rainfall on Sunday had him finishing 20th. This year on tour, just 13 players have a better scoring average (adjusted) than Spieth's 70.179, so he's performing much better than his long Open Championship odds indicate.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-predictions-top-picks-props-longshots-and-pga-golfers-to-fade-this-week/#ttag=07092025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_Kannon_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">See who else to back here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship picks </h2><p>Kannon has locked in his best bets for the 2025 Open Championship and has also selected two epic longshots who are priced over 75-1.
