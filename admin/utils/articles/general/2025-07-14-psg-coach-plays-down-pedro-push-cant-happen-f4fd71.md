"It's very stressful for all of us. It is going to be impossible to avoid that.</p><p>"Everybody was involved. It was not what was best and the end result of the pressure of the match.</p><p>"I have seen [Chelsea coach Enzo] Maresca. I saw he had pushed others and we had to separate all the players and I do not know where that pressure came from.</p><p>"But this is a situation we must all avoid. That goes without saying. My intention is that I wanted to separate the footballers, so the situations didn't become worse."</p><p>Chelsea's Pedro said he thought some of the team may have temporarily lost their heads after the loss, but seemed to write the situation off while talking in the mixed zone.</p><p>"I don't need to say about them because it's normal. Everyone wants to win the game and, in the end, I think they lost their heads," Pedro said. "But this is football, this has happened and now we need to enjoy it because we won the tournament, that's it. I don't want to talk too much about them because you know how it works. Football is this."</p><p>After falling to a surprise defeat, which denied PSG the chance to add a world title to their Champions League crown, Luis Enrique said his team were not "losers."</p><p>"We are not losers, there are no losers," he said. "We are the runners-up. A loser is somebody who gives up. In this high level of sport there are no losers whatsoever."</p><p>Luis Enrique and PSG will get some needed time off with the conclusion of the Club World Cup. They return to action on the weekend of Aug. 17 when Ligue 1 play resumes.</p>
