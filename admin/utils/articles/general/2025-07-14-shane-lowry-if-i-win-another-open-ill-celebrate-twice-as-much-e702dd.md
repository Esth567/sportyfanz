description: "Irishman explains the emotion of winning Claret Jug at Portrush in 2019 after the ‘toughest 24 hours of my sporting life’ The gable end of a house on Causeway Street in Portrush delivers a reminder of Shane Lowry’s Open triumph in 2019. The fantastic mural not only depicts Lowry with the Claret Jug in hand, but how Ireland, whether north or south, unites behind its sportspeople. Lingering memories from six years ago recall Lowry stretching away from the field towards the end of round three. He was in an unassailable position.

You can’t play at this level without doing that. If I win another one, I’ll celebrate twice as good. It’s so hard out here, so hard to win big tournaments that when you do, you need to enjoy them.</p><p>“Players came to me afterwards… I remember Martin Kaymer’s caddie telling me: ‘Martin regrets not doing what you did because when he was winning majors, world No 1, he took it for granted a little bit.’ You need to enjoy the moments.”</p><p>The Open’s return to Northern Ireland turns thoughts back towards what Lowry achieved. The outpouring of emotion was due in part to what he encountered before the last round.

People are definitely tense around you. It is a tough place. The consequences of failure were so huge. If I didn’t win that day, I still wouldn’t be over it. How much it meant, where it was, all that stuff.</p><p>“Oakmont helped me, 100%. I went out in the final round there not to lose the tournament. At Portrush, I went out to win. I said to Neil [Manchip, Lowry’s coach] that Sunday morning: ‘If I can make five birdies today, nobody can beat me.’ Even if I made five bogeys as well and shot level, nobody was beating me in that weather. That was the mindset. At Oakmont, I went out to make pars and let it all slip.”</p><p>Lowry felt at home on the Dunluce Links and he was roared on towards victory by a mix of total strangers and those closest to him. “Until I played my tee shot on the 17th on Sunday, I didn’t allow myself to think, ‘This is it.’ I hit that one and realised I could kick it in from there, I had a six-shot lead.</p><p>“I was looking out for people. I saw a lot of friends at the top of the 18th grandstand. Turning the dog-leg corner at the last, I could see my daughter… she was only two-and-a-half at the time and had this bright yellow jacket on. I could see that right behind the flag, in the tunnel at the back of the 18th green. A wave of emotion came over me. I could have cried.</p><p>“I remember my caddie saying to me something like: ‘Man up, you still have a shot to hit.’ At the back of the 18th, most of the people who have been hugely influential in my career were there. My parents were there, my coach, Graeme McDowell, Pádraig Harrington. It was incredible.”</p><figure id="899721e0-a1d3-4809-9067-241d3c2f8182" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Shane Lowry emerges from the gallery on the 18th as he walks up the fairway holding a five-shot lead at the 2019 Open." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588dd39aaef04d81d9147d69cdea931238931580/0_0_3500_2248/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="285.8171428571428" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Shane Lowry emerges from the gallery on the 18th as he walks up the fairway holding a five-shot lead at the 2019 Open.</span> Photograph: Action Plus Sports Images/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Lowry used to regularly watch footage of his Open glory.

That doesn’t at all mean I don’t want more.”</p></div></div>
