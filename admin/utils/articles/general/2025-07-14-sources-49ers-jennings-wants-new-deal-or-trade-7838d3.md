If a new deal is not reached by the time training camp starts next week, Jennings plans to request a trade to a team willing to pay him.</p><p>Entering 2025, Jennings is slated to count $4.258 million against the cap in the final year of the two-year, $15.39 million extension he signed last offseason.</p><p>He is not expected to be a training camp holdout, but he is not expected to be happy, either, as the 49ers saw last summer with Aiyuk.</p><p>Aiyuk, who is recovering from a torn ACL, is scheduled to make close to $25 million this season under the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41046037/sources-49ers-brandon-aiyuk-reach-4-year-120m-extension">extension he signed in August</a>.</p><p>The 49ers <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/40240776/49ers-sign-wide-receiver-jauan-jennings-2025">extended Jennings through 2025</a> last year, and feel they have treated him fairly, a source said, but Jennings still wants a new deal or a trade.</p><p>He is coming off his best NFL season, posting career highs in receptions (77), yards (975) and touchdowns (6). He finished 10th in yards per route run (2.51) and had only one drop. In addition, coach Kyle Shanahan considers Jennings to be one of the best blocking wideouts in the league.</p><p>Jennings is following the model that tight end <a data-player-guid="58017d3f-d9dd-7db8-4494-a5d6f7d63b9c" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054212/jonnu-smith">Jonnu Smith</a> used this summer with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="af33088b-1e19-d27d-dbc0-354fd7151703" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>.
