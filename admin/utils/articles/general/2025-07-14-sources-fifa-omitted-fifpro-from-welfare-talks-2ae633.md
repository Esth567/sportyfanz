A verdict has yet to be reached.</p><p>Sources have said that player representatives at the meeting with Infantino included national union officials whose organisations have been expelled from FIFPRO or who have lost their position at FIFPRO following a democratic process.</p><p>ESPN has been told that senior player representatives regard FIFA's statement as "deeply flawed" and that none of the agreements reached are legally binding.</p><p>ESPN has contacted FIFA for a response.</p>
