        <p>The Sun Belt Conference's CEOs voted to extend an invitation to Conference USA's <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LATECH/louisiana-tech-bulldogs/">Louisiana Tech</a> Monday morning, <a href="https://x.com/PeteThamel/status/1944748195411644548" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to ESPN</a>. Louisiana Tech is set to replace <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXSTSM/texas-state-bobcats/">Texas State</a>, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/texas-state-to-join-pac-12-why-the-bobcats-are-a-perfect-fit-even-1100-miles-from-the-pacific-ocean/" target="_blank">which is departing for the Pac-12 in 2026</a></span>, as the Sun Belt's 14th member.</p><p>ESPN also notes that Louisiana Tech will accept a buyout that is at least $5 million to exit Conference USA. The earliest Louisiana Tech can leave is 2026, which aligns with the latest wave of conference realignment.&nbsp;</p><p>It will be a homecoming of sorts for Louisiana Tech, which was a full member of the Sun Belt from 1991-2001, though the football program remained independent for a majority of the 1990s following its transition from the NCAA Division I-AA level. The Bulldogs were in the Big West Conference from 1993-95.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Louisiana Tech has competed in Conference USA since 2013. Though the Bulldogs never won a Conference USA championship, they did claim the West Division crown twice under former coach Skip Holtz, and shared the top spot with <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UAB/uab-blazers/">UAB</a> in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Coach Sonny Cumbie led Louisiana Tech to the Independence Bowl last season for the Bulldogs' first postseason appearance since 2020.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>The men's basketball program won two straight C-USA regular season titles from 2014-15 and earned a bid to the National Invitation Tournament with coach <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/2183722/mike-white/">Mike White</a> leading the charge.&nbsp;</p>
