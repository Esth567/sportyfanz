Mosquera was identified as Arsenal’s main target to provide competition for William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães after establishing himself as a first choice for Valencia over the past two seasons.</p><p>His deal means Arsenal have committed to spending potentially more than £200m on players since March’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/30/andrea-berta-thrilled-to-be-named-arsenals-new-sporting-director" data-link-name="in body link">appointment of the sporting director</a>, Andrea Berta.
