So she tried to qualify but lost. This year, Anisimova was seeded at Wimbledon and made it all the way to her first Grand Slam final, beating No. 1 <a data-player-guid="c91d133a-526a-ea8d-654c-7ef6915ad63b" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3038">Aryna Sabalenka</a> in the semifinals before losing to Swiatek 6-0, 6-0.</p><p>"I look at it, and I'm like, 'Oh, wow.' It's kind of a shock at first, and I can't really process it. Then it's like, 'Oh, yeah, I've played very well so far this year,' so it kind of makes sense. I feel like I kind of look at it from both sides," Anisimova said.</p><p>She climbed from No. 12.</p><p>"I mean, it's super special and a surreal feeling to be in the top 10," Anisimova said. "If I thought to myself last year, if someone told me that I'll be breaking the top 10 by now, I don't know, it would be pretty surprising to me considering where I was last summer."</p><p>Swiatek was No. 1 for most of the past three seasons but a year without reaching a tournament final dropped her to No. 8 last month. Making the final at a grass-court tournament before Wimbledon pushed her up to No. 4, and now she's another place higher after collecting her sixth major trophy.</p><p>Sabalenka remained atop the women's rankings, followed by French Open champion <a data-player-guid="ca44c2b0-9dea-ab40-2541-b50a4442ff8e" href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3626">Coco Gauff</a>, who lost in the first round at Wimbledon.</p><p><a data-player-guid="8faf299a-0a3b-4fc9-024d-4fd338e0f201" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1881">Laura Siegemund</a> leaped up 50 spots for the biggest improvement Monday -- from 104th to 54th -- by getting to the quarterfinals.</p><p>The biggest fall was by 2024 Wimbledon champion <a data-player-guid="22c6138f-4536-293a-6673-6b65f9af45d7" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2042">Barbora Krejcikova</a>, who slid 62 places, from No. 16 to No. 78, after bowing out in the third round.</p><p><a data-player-guid="431a1bce-57de-2a02-8022-9f32b0f60efb" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3623">Jannik Sinner</a> stayed at No. 1 in the ATP after his first Wimbledon title and fourth at a Grand Slam tournament. <a data-player-guid="07843754-8bdf-63b0-5983-24252738169e" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3782">Carlos Alcaraz</a>, the two-time defending champion who lost in Sunday's final, kept his No. 2 ranking.</p><p>Semifinalist <a data-player-guid="6493155f-cacc-7aa5-ba78-d952efa4c652" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2946">Taylor Fritz</a> went up from No. 5 to No. 4, swapping with <a data-player-guid="ad748b23-89bf-3a17-ed66-f592fd6f2b0b" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3856">Jack Draper</a>. <a data-player-guid="62b541a8-4480-30f7-87a6-b45d09376f39" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=7602">Flavio Cobolli</a>'s debut in a Grand Slam quarterfinal -- he lost in that round to <a data-player-guid="4a27bb1c-2422-55c3-208b-9e9d8c1f30af" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=296">Novak Djokovic</a> -- lifted the 23-year-old Italian into the top 20 for the first time, going from No. 24 to No. 19.</p><p><a data-player-guid="2358bec1-f6f0-3540-a37e-13bc322d2c08" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=9250">Ben Shelton</a> rose one spot to No. 9, and <a data-player-guid="9a0b09b5-59b7-1cf1-4135-e1cc55e3280b" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2642">Andrey Rublev</a> rose four to No. 10.</p>
