season.</b></p><p>The governing body says it is entering a formal consultation with the Professional Rugby Board (PRB) and could reduce the number of regions to three or even two.</p><p>In a statement, the WRU said the current system is failing and is unsustainable, having already confirmed it does not intend to continue equally funding four professional teams in the men's game.</p><p>Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets are the four current sides, with the WRU saying it wants a "more radical" strategy to be completed by October.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Union said it would consult on a reduction to three or two regions to ensure Wales has "teams that can compete" at the top of the professional game.</p><p>The shake-up also comes after the men's side suffered its worst season with nine defeats in 10 games that drew a total losing sequence of 18 matches, a run that only ended last weekend with a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cj4ezjynkljo">31-22 victory</a> in the second Test against Japan.</p><p>"The current rugby system in Wales, which includes national teams, professional clubs, community clubs, academies, universities and schools isn't delivering consistent success on the field and isn't currently financially sustainable given the likely investment required, even with the recent actions taken to increase financial resources," the WRU said.</p><p>"The WRU is therefore considering a more radical strategy focused on maximising investment and reforming the whole structure of professional rugby in Wales, amongst other options."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The formal consultation, which will also include players and the Union's member clubs, is aimed at ending an 18-month deadlock between the WRU and the regions.</p><p>The current professional rugby agreement (PRA), that underpins the Welsh professional game, runs out in 2027.</p><p>It was due to be superseded by a new five-year deal agreed by WRU-owned Cardiff and privately-owned Dragons, but has still not been signed by either Ospreys or Scarlets.</p><p>The four sides are expected to continue to exist in their current form until at least June 2027 when the current PRA runs out.</p><p>But now the future of the organisations will be under fresh scrutiny.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Key potential developments to be consulted on include:</p><div><ul role="list"><li><p>A reduction to three or two regional men's teams.</p></li><li><p>Financial sustainability.</p></li><li><p>Further investment in the semi-professional Super Rygbi Cymru.</p></li><li><p>Significant investment in player development and pathways.</p></li><li><p>A national centre providing development for elite players, coaches and staff.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>More to
