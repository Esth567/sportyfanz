        <p>Shane Lowry's lone major victory came at the Open Championship in 2019, which was also played at Royal Portrush, the host site of the 2025 Open Championship. Lowry has struggled thus far in majors in 2025, finishing T-42 or worse in all three, which includes missing the cut at the PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Lowry will be among the notable longshots at the 2025 Open Championship, which gets underway on Thursday at 1:35 a.m. ET.</p><p>Should Lowry be included in your 2025 Open Championship bets, or are you better off backing one of the favorites like Scottie Scheffler or Rory McIlroy? According to the latest 2025 Open Championship odds, Scheffler is going off as the +450 favorite (risk $100 to win $450), while Lowry is a 35-1 longshot.

<p>Now that the 2025 Open Championship  field is locked in and fans are deciding where to bet the Open Championship, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-picks-odds-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-predictions-for-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-and-others/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipNames" target="_blank">Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard</a>.</p><h2>2025 Open Championship  predictions for Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau&nbsp;</h2><p>One shocker the model is calling at the Open Championship 2025: Rory McIlroy, a five-time major champion, stumbles this week and falls out of the top three. McIlroy completed the coveted Grand Slam with his dramatic victory at the Masters in April. That was his sixth major victory, but arguably the most satisfying of his career. The Northern Ireland native finally got his first green jacket and completed his career grand slam on his 17th attempt at Augusta.</p><p>McIlroy also won the Open Championship in 2014, but he has been hit or miss at this major in recent years. In fact, McIlroy has finished T-46 or worse in three of his last five starts at The Open, which includes missing the cut at Royal Portrush in 2019. &nbsp;</p>
        

<p>The model has also locked in its projection for Scottie Scheffler, who is now a three-time major champion after winning the PGA Championship earlier this year. He's unquestionably the best player in the world right now after piling up 16 wins on the PGA Tour since Feb. 2022, but he has had a few difficulties in the Open Championship. He hasn't cracked the top five in any of his four starts in golf's oldest major and was outside the top 20 twice.</p><p>However, he has been inside the top 25 in all four of his Open Championship starts and was top 10 twice, including a career-best t-7th finish last year at Royal Troon. He's top 25 in all four major strokes gained categories on the PGA Tour this season and his improvements to his all-around game, particularly his putting, are a big reason why he could finally be a factor in an Open Championship. Scheffler is -110 to finish in the top 5 and -220 to finish in the top 10.</p><p>The model has also locked in its projection for Bryson DeChambeau, who is a two-time major champion who also had top-five finishes in both this year's Masters and PGA Championship. DeChambeau wasn't able to maintain his top-five streak at last month's U.S. Open as he missed the cut after winning the major a year ago. Nonetheless, he's been on quite a run over his last seven major starts as he has five finishes in the top six.</p>
        

<p>DeChambeau collected his 14th professional win in May in South Korea, but success has been fleeting at this specific major tournament. The Open is the only that he's never recorded a top 5 at, and he only has one top 25 over his seven British Open starts. DeChambeau missed the cut in 2019 when The Open was last at Royal Portrush, shooting 5-over-par and finishing four strokes back of the cut line. Thus, he'll look to lean more on recent results, both in majors and this season, rather than his history at The Open Championship.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-picks-odds-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-predictions-for-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-and-others/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipNames" target="_blank">See the full Open Championship projections from the model here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship  picks</h2><p>The model is targeting targeting five golfers with odds of 28-1 or longer to make a strong run up the leaderboard, including a monster 50-1 longshot. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-picks-odds-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-predictions-for-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-and-others/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipNames" target="_blank">You can only see the model's picks here</a>.</p><p><strong>Who will win the 2025 Open Championship, which longshots will stun the golfing world, and where will Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau finish?
