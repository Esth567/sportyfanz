        <p>Following Brian Harman's 2023 win and Xander Schauffele's victory a year ago, Americans are going for a three-peat at the Open Championship 2025. Not since 2004-06 have Americans won The Open three years in a row, and there are several U.S.-born golfers expected to contend for the 2025 Open championship. Seven of the world's top eight ranked golfers are Americans including Schauffele, Scottie Scheffler, Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa.</p><p>The top of the 2025 Open Championship odds has board four of the top eight favorites being Americans. Scheffler (+450) leads the way, with the U.S. also represented by Bryson DeChambeau (+2000) and Schauffele (+2500). Europeans also populate the British Open odds board with Rory McIlroy at +700, Jon Rahm at +1200 and Ludvig Aberg at +2800. Scheffler (-110) also has the lowest odds to finish in the top 5, followed by McIlroy at +150.

In fact, the model is up over $8,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.</p><p>This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- and the 2025 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed its <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/" target="_blank">sports betting</a> picks could have seen massive returns on <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">betting sites</a></span>. New users have the opportunity to take advantage of the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/">FanDuel promo code</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/">DraftKings promo code</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanatics-promo-code/">Fanatics Sportsbook promo code</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Now that the 2025 Open Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>2025 Open Championship predictions&nbsp;</h2><p>One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Open Championship: McIlroy, a five-time major champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles outside of the top three. McIlroy last won The Open in 2014, but missed the cut last year. In total, he has just a pair of top-10 finishes at this event since his 2014 win.</p><p>Though he did tie for second at the Scottish Open, McIlroy's full body of work hasn't been too impressive since the Masters win this year. He finished T47 at the PGA Championship and T19 at the U.S. Open. He also has just the one top-five finish at the Scottish Open in non-majors since his Masters victory. He's not a strong pick to win it all, and there are far better values in the 2025 Open Championship field.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">See who else to fade here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Another surprise: Tommy Fleetwood, a 28-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. While none of Fleetwood's 10 professional wins have come on the PGA Tour, he's been one of the most consistent golfers around. He's ranked inside the top 20 in World Ranking continuously since Aug. 2023 and is currently in the top 10 of FedEx Cup standings. He's been on, arguably, the best run of his career over the last few months with four top-7 finishes over his last seven tournaments, with three of those top 7s coming at signature events.</p><p>Fleetwood's performance on tour is validated by his metrics as he ranks third in both strokes gained: total and scoring average (adjusted). His major history at The Open is also impressive with four top-12 finishes over his last five British Open starts. That includes a runner-up the last time the major was at Royal Portrush (2019), so there are lots of things in Fleetwood's favor for The Open 2025. He has a much better chance to prevail than his long PGA odds imply, so Fleetwood would be a steal in Open Championship bets.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">See who else to pick here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>The model is also targeting four other golfers with odds of 28-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title, including one massive 50-1 longshot. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">You can only see the model's picks here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
