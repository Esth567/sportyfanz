<p>The 2025 Open Championship, often referred to as the British Open, returns to Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland on Thursday for the first time since 2019, and Shane Lowry hopes to replicate his performance from six years ago. The Irishman won his only career major at The Open in 2019, and despite being a 30-1 longshot in the latest 2025 Open Championship odds, the model sees value in featuring Lowry in 2025 Open Championship picks on&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">betting sites</a></span>. Lowry will likely have plenty of supporters behind him with the final major of the year taking place in Northern Ireland, so if you're a fan of playing longshots when online sports betting, the model views Lowry as one to target for 2025 Open Championship bets.</p><p>A major field brings out the best in the world, and Scottie Scheffler is the +450 favorite in the latest 2025 Open Championship odds. He's followed by Rory McIlroy (+700), Jon Rahm (+1200) and Bryson DeChambeau (+2000) with the next lowest odds to win the Open Championship 2025. Along with being listed at +3000 odds to win at FanDuel Sportsbook, Lowry is +250 to finish in the top 10 and +115 to finish in the top 20 at Royal Portrush.</p><p>Now that the 2025 Open Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and revealed its longshot betting picks. New users have the opportunity to take advantage of the latest <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/" target="_blank">DraftKings promo code</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/" target="_blank">BetMGM promo code</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/bet365-promo-code/" target="_blank">bet365 bonus code</a></span> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanatics-promo-code/">Fanatics Sportsbook promo code</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tommy Fleetwood (28-1)</h2><p>Fleetwood is 0-for-160 over his PGA Tour career, still seeking his first victory in more than a decade competing in PGA Tour events. But with five top-10 finishes, including a runner-up at the Travelers Championship on June 22, over 15 PGA Tour events this year, Fleetwood is playing some of the most competitive golf of his career. He's finished fourth or better in three of his last seven tournaments, and the 34-year-old is fourth on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained this year.</p><p>The Englishman has a successful history at Royal Portrush Golf Club, finishing second at the 2019 Open Championship. The Englishman has three top-10 results over his last five Open Championship events at a tournament that font means even more to Europeans such as Fleetwood. Fleetwood has at least one top-five result at a major in six of the prior seven years (outside of 2020), which he hasn't achieved this year yet. But given Fleetwood is playing a course he has a strong history at, the model sees value in Fleetwood for 2025 Open Championship bets. DraftKings is offering the best odds on Fleetwood at 28-1, and the latest <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/" target="_blank">DraftKings promo code</a></span> instantly gives new users $150 in bonus bets after making their first $5 bet.&nbsp;</p><h2>Shane Lowry (30-1)</h2><p>Fleetwood's 2019 second-place finish at Royal Portrush came behind Lowry's victory as the 2019 Open Champion looks to win back-to-back majors held at this Northern Ireland course. Lowry had a dominant victory in 2019, winning by six strokes, and that course success could carry over six years later. The 38-year-old missed the cut in the last two majors this year, but the Irishman will have much of the crowd behind him for the European major less than 200 miles from his home county.</p><p>Lowry finished sixth at last year's Open Championship for his second top-six result at a major in 2024. He's finished in the top 25 in 13 of his last 19 majors, including three top-12 results over his last five Open Championships. He's 13th on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained, highlighted by ranking third in strokes gained: Approach to Green, and he's third in proximity. Strong approach shots can put Lowry in a position to repeat his success from 2019 at Royal Portrush, and at 30-1 odds on FanDuel, the model sees value in this play. You can also use the latest <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/" target="_blank">FanDuel promo code</a></span> to receive $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins.&nbsp;</p><h2>Justin Thomas (55-1)</h2><p>The 32-year-old is fourth in the FedEx Cup standings as the former No. 1 ranked golfer is performing closer to his once elite status. Thomas has a victory and two runner-up results over his last nine PGA Tour events. His RBC Heritage victory on April 20 snapped a nearly 36-month winless streak. Despite going nearly three full years without a victory, Thomas still has 16 career PGA Tour wins, including two majors, as he competes in his ninth Open Championship.</p><p>Thomas finished T-11 at the 2019 Open Championships at Royal Portrush Golf Club. He's made the cut in 14 of 16 PGA Tour events this year. However, he has missed the cut at seven of his last 11 majors, but the model views his price dropping to more than 50-1 odds as an overreaction to that. Thomas is having one of the best putting seasons on the PGA Tour, ranking first in birdie average and putting average, and some timely putts can move him toward the top of the 2025 Open Championship leaderboard. You can bet on Thomas at bet365, where you can&nbsp;<a href="https://slc.cbssports.com/clickout/visitDirectLink?st=cbs&amp;op=bet365&amp;type=sport&amp;d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bet365.com%2Fhub%2Faff%2Fapp-hero-banner-1%3Faffiliate%3D365_03354659&amp;clickoutElement=cbssports-single-prism&amp;pt=cbssports-single-prism&amp;sid=e11240a0-7ddb-4e48-84f7-d230a0626425--9bdf" target="_blank">bet $5 and get $150 in bonus bets, win or lose</a>:</p><h2>More 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>You've seen the latest longshots from the model.
