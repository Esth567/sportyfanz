"And obviously, in the moment, you're like, 'that's something I'm interested in!' But you want to focus on what you're doing.</p><p>"Then, as it starts to progress, you start to look more into it. And there is this project I'd love to be a part of. And I just hoped for it to get across the line. And happily, it did."</p><p>In his third year with Charlotte in MLS, the striker has scored six goals and added one assist through 16 appearances in 2025. Across 59 regular season matches since 2023, Agyemang has scored 17 times for Charlotte.</p><p>With a new forward bolstering the attack, Derby County will look to improve on its 19th place finish last season, which was just one point out of the relegation zone.</p><p>Derby, though, said its new signing is likely to miss the start of the Championship season.</p><p>"Agyemang has been playing for most of the 2025 Major League Soccer season with a hernia injury that has been managed without surgery but meant he has been playing in discomfort," Derby said in its announcement. "With a long-term view in mind, all parties have agreed he will undergo routine surgery and is therefore likely to miss the opening games of the 2025-26 season."</p>
