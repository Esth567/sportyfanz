        <p>C.J. Gardner-Johnson was traded to the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/">Houston Texans</a> just a month after helping the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/">Philadelphia Eagles</a> win <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/">Super Bowl</a> LIX, a move widely seen as a salary cap dump. But the outspoken safety saw it differently. Gardner explained his perspective <a href="https://youtu.be/wRClkZ-nOdk?si=AAaEeZi3jdu-IRBV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on "The Pivot" podcast</a>, saying the Eagles didn't move him for financial reasons -- they moved him out of fear.</p><p>"Scared of a competitor," Gardner-Johnson said. "Simple as that. ... You can't program a dawg."</p><p>Gardner-Johnson pointed to the Week 16 matchup against the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/">Washington Commanders</a>, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-c-j-gardner-johnson-ejected-nfl-official-gives-explanation-for-disqualifying-safety-vs-commanders/" target="_blank">where he was ejected in the second half after receiving his second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty</a></span> -- an automatic disqualification under league rules. He suggested that moment, along with a heated practice incident during the postseason, may have shaped how the organization viewed him.</p><p>"We had a little scrum at practice," Gardner-Johnson said. "Nothing, just offense versus defense, but who's the culprit of it? Me. I guess, because we're competing. Well, you tell me the period is live. You're telling us not to compete during a live period, but it's a live period, and we're getting ready for a playoff game?"</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/c-j-gardner-johnson-torches-philadelphia-eagles-for-trade-directs-barb-at-vic-fangio/" target="_blank">

<p>Still, Gardner-Johnson insisted the friction never came from within the locker room -- only from higher up.</p>
        

<p>"You want me to be a leader and outspoken, but then you want me to sit back," Gardner-Johnson said. "There's nowhere been a locker room where I had a single issue with a teammate."</p><p>Gardner-Johnson had signed a three-year, $27 million deal with the Eagles in March 2024, making a return to the franchise he helped guide to an appearance in Super Bowl LVII as the <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL's</a> co-interceptions leader during the 2022 season.</p><p>Johnson started every game for Philadelphia last season, registering 59 total tackles while matching a career-high six interceptions.</p>
        

<p>Philadelphia general manager Howie Roseman addressed the trade back in March at the NFL's annual meetings, calling it a tough decision but one made with the long-term roster in mind and aimed at maximizing team-building flexibility.</p>
