British and Irish Lions in the first Test against Australia, with Wales' Jac Morgan missing out on selection.</b></p><p>Morgan, Wales' only representative in the 44-man squad, had been pushing hard for a place on the open-side flank after some outstanding performances on tour.</p><p>But Lions boss Andy Farrell is set to opt for Curry's pedigree and experience when the team is confirmed on Thursday.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is understood Sione Tuipulotu will start at inside centre as part of an all-Scottish midfield.</p><p>The Glasgow centre is expected to line up in-between fly-half Finn Russell and club-mate Huw Jones.</p><p>If confirmed, it will be the first time since 1993 one country has provided the 10/12/13 axis in a Lions Test, when Englishmen Rob Andrew, Will Carling and Jeremy Guscott all played in the series opener against New Zealand.</p><p>Elsewhere, Ireland's Tadhg Beirne and England's Ollie Chessum are competing to join Curry and the Irishman Jack Conan in the back row.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Morgan's omission from the matchday squad would mean Wales don't have a representative in a Test match for the first time since 1896, according to <a href="https://x.com/rpetty80">rugby statistician Russ Petty.<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a></p><p>Jamison Gibson-Park is set to partner Finn Russell at half-back, with James Lowe, Tommy Freeman and Hugo Keenan the likely back three.</p><p>It is also thought Owen Farrell could miss out on the matchday squad. </p><p>Farrell came off the bench last weekend against the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV, producing a neat cameo in a thumping Lions victory, and was expected to be in contention to make the bench given his ability to play fly-half and centre.</p><p>However, it was the former England skipper's first game in 10 weeks, with suggestions from sources that it is a little too soon for Farrell to return to the Test arena. </p><p>If Farrell does not make it, compatriot Marcus Smith is set to feature among the replacements.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source
