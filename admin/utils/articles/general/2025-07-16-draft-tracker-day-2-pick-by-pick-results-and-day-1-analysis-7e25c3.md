He reclassified to the 2025 class, so is one of the younger players in the draft, not turning 18 until December, a big plus in analytic draft models. He's a clear shortstop with a good hit tool and contact ability, with his future power outcome the biggest question mark as he turns pro.</p><p><strong>Why the Nationals took him here: </strong>There was a lot of intrigue about which direction the Nationals would go in a draft without a slam-dunk No. 1 pick -- and Washington surprised everyone with this pick. Willits was one of the top players in this draft, but he was behind Ethan Holliday and Kade Anderson as options to go No. 1 overall. He's one of the youngest prospects in this draft -- and that's a very good thing for his potential, considering <a data-player-guid="62868d49-9586-ee9d-19b4-66fb91f26733" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32653/carlos-correa">Carlos Correa</a> and <a data-player-guid="94848feb-9141-9679-d2cd-ae79905d969c" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32129/francisco-lindor">Francisco Lindor</a> were also both 17-year-old shortstops on draft night.</p><p>There's also a chance that taking Willits here could come with some bonus-money savings that sets Washington up for some splashy picks in the coming rounds. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong>Kevin McGonigle, with more speed and defense</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>2. <a data-clubhouse-guid="053868c7-8bff-5edb-3cb6-f5490f33ef99" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels">Los Angeles Angels</a>: Tyler Bremner, RHP, UC Santa Barbara</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 18</p><p><strong>Who is Bremner?</strong> Bremner entered the season alongside Jamie Arnold as the top collegiate pitcher after a strong sophomore season and a summer pitching for USA Baseball's collegiate national team, but he scuffled early on with inconsistent stuff and results. He finished stronger, including a string of double-digit-strikeout games, and he threw strikes, walking just 19 batters in 77⅓ innings with 111 strikeouts. He sits 94-96, touching 98, but his plus changeup might be his best offering while his slider was hit hard and backed up compared to 2024.</p><p><strong>Why the Angels took him here: </strong>Two picks into this draft and teams are already sending a clear message, as Bremner is the second straight curveball: The talent at the top doesn't match that of recent drafts, so Washington and L.A. are likely saving money with their picks with underslot deals. Bremner does fit the Angels' model of drafting college prospects who can move quickly, but ESPN's Kiley McDaniel had Bremner ranked just 18th on his <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45688041/2025-mlb-draft-rankings-top-250-prospects-final-kade-anderson-liam-doyle-ethan-holliday">most recent draft board</a>. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> <a data-player-guid="a6551440-b17b-3fc1-60b7-5dbce0a5bda7" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32640/michael-wacha">Michael Wacha</a> with more upside</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sea.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>3. <a data-clubhouse-guid="56d60582-088f-6848-5180-1fb04440cf87" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners">Seattle Mariners</a>: Kade Anderson, LHP, LSU</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 1</p><p><strong>Who is Anderson? </strong>Winner of the Most Outstanding Player award at the College World Series in leading LSU to the title after allowing one run in 17 innings, including a 1-0 shutout in the finals, Anderson topped Division I with 180 strikeouts, finishing 12-1 with a 3.18 ERA. Anderson had Tommy John surgery in high school, missing his senior season, but he's a polished lefty with a five-pitch repertoire if you include both his fastballs. His fastball carries well in the zone, and he commands it well, so it plays up over its 92-94 mph velocity (hitting 97).</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45735038" data-cerebro-id="686dfae6ea1499368b3987e3" data-title="The traits that helped make Kade Anderson a Mariner" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45735038">play</span><figcaption><p>0:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Kade Anderson a Mariner</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped make Kade Anderson the third overall pick by the Mariners.</p></div></div><p><strong>Why the Mariners took him here: </strong>Seattle really couldn't have asked for a better situation than this.

Like his brother, Ethan is a left-handed hitter, although he's much bigger (6-foot-4 compared to 6-foot) and built more like their dad, thus projects to have similar 30-homer power. He lacks the range to stay at shortstop but should be an above-average defender at third base. There are some concerns about his performance last summer on the showcase circuit and weak competition this spring in high school, but scouts love the swing and power ceiling.</p><p><strong>Why the Rockies took him here:</strong> There was plenty of talk about Holliday being a possibility for the No. 1 pick, so the Rockies have to be happy about getting the player who might have the best chance of developing into a true major league star. His best-case scenario is reaching the majors as a power-hitting, good-fielding third baseman who turns into the Rockies' first franchise player since they traded away a power-hitting, good-fielding third baseman in Nolan Arenado. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> Left-handed-hitting version of <a data-player-guid="2eb5e599-5517-7cf4-8f12-de7e6bd899f3" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33857/matt-chapman">Matt Chapman</a> or <a data-player-guid="1a1ec65f-a81f-8ce9-9f38-7275b93a2474" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez">Eugenio Suarez</a></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/stl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>5. <a data-clubhouse-guid="c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>: Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 6</p><p><strong>Who is Doyle? </strong>One of the three highly rated lefty collegiate pitchers, Doyle went 10-4 with a 3.20 ERA for the Vols, striking out 164 in 95⅔ innings, finishing second in Division I in strikeouts and first in K's per nine. After sitting in the low 90s as a sophomore, Doyle sat in the mid-90s, peaking at 100 mph and often just blowing his heater by college hitters.

The question here is if the rest of Doyle's arsenal and delivery can be strong enough to keep him in the rotation. Best case, St. Louis just added a strong part of its rotation for years to come -- but a potential closer or top setup option isn't a bad fallback plan either. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> <a data-player-guid="fe783a66-6c4d-3706-afae-cc30e5651f97" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4307825/spencer-strider">Spencer Strider</a>, if he was left-handed but had real questions about his command/stamina/delivery</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/pit.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>6. <a data-clubhouse-guid="5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>: Seth Hernandez, RHP, Corona HS (Calif.)</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 4</p><p><strong>Who is Hernandez? </strong>No high school right-hander has ever gone first overall, but Hernandez put himself in that discussion as the clear top prep arm in the draft. With a projectable 6-4 frame, he followed up a strong summer in 2024 with a dominant high school season, touching triple digits but also showcasing a plus-plus changeup and an above-average 12-to-6 curveball with a high spin rate. He was athletic enough to play the field when he didn't pitch, which might help him overcome the risky history of first-round high school pitchers.</p><p><strong>Why the Pirates took him here: </strong>The Pirates have Paul Skenes in the majors and Bubba Chandler, perhaps the top pitching prospect in the minors, in Triple-A, and now they've added Hernandez, who might have the most upside of any pitcher in the draft, with a fastball up to 100 mph and plus-plus changeup. He's a good athlete (he was a second-round prospect as a hitter), which is another plus. The only negative is the scary history of first-round high school pitching prospects, but Hernandez might be the best prep right-handed prospect in a decade. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong><a data-player-guid="fc1345d7-f487-a73d-b74a-5c781b21d2d1" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39910/zac-gallen">Zac Gallen</a> with more stuff or <a data-player-guid="4a17f08f-b20a-2d81-ae0c-ec06266eb20e" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33224/devin-williams">Devin Williams</a> as a starter</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mia.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>7. <a data-clubhouse-guid="74909d10-eacb-1376-ef1e-d0f37d7c67ca" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins">Miami Marlins</a>: Aiva Arquette, SS, Oregon State</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 9</p><p><strong>Who is Arquette? </strong>The latest in the Oregon State pipeline that has produced first-round picks <a data-player-guid="6c414a08-2165-0c57-8a0c-093886b3be8b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41170/nick-madrigal">Nick Madrigal</a>, <a data-player-guid="3b60625b-9789-1a06-612f-dc3c588db16b" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41205/trevor-larnach">Trevor Larnach</a>, <a data-player-guid="ef72b3ad-2cb6-eecb-37ab-24726859d3c5" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42178/adley-rutschman">Adley Rutschman</a>, Cooper Hjerpe and Travis Bazzana since 2018, Arquette is a Honolulu native who transferred from Washington and hit .354 with 19 home runs for the Beavers.

He looked good there this spring in his first season at the position. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nyy.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>39. <a data-clubhouse-guid="2b9cedf3-ce60-0bcf-fafe-8cd055255685" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees">New York Yankees</a>: Dax Kilby, SS, Newnan HS (Ga.), Clemson commit</strong></p><p>Yes, another left-handed-hitting prep shortstop. Kilby, No. 28 in Kiley's draft rankings, has a short and direct swing to the ball, showing excellent contact skills and performing well against elite pitching on the showcase circuit last summer. He's a lean 6-3, with room to add more bulk, projecting to average power. He'll have to find a defensive home as scouts project a move to second base or outfield. The MLB player comp here is Colt Keith/Ryan McMahon, but with a chance for a better hit tool.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/lad.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>40. <a data-clubhouse-guid="fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>: Zach Root, LHP, Arkansas</strong></p><p>After Hagen Smith went No. 5 in the 2024 MLB draft, Root had a strong year replacing him as Arkansas' Friday night starter and struck out 126 hitters in 99⅓ innings. An East Carolina transfer, Root doesn't have the upside Smith had but still profiles as a future big league starter with a solid four-pitch mix highlighted by his changeup and curveball. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/lad.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>41.

He's just 5-9 and his arm limits him to second base or maybe left field (he's played both in college), but he has leadoff skills and a high motor. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tb.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>42.

He was hitting over .400 before the fracture, but his exit velocity readings were down from 2024 even before the injury, and he finished with just four home runs in 44 games. He played right field for the Wildcats but played center on the Cape and could be given a chance there, where there would be less pressure on the power to develop. Summerhill is in the Riley Greene/Brandon Nimmo range as a hit-over-power tweener who could grow into above-average power production.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mia.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><p><strong>43. Miami Marlins: Cam Cannarella, CF, Clemson</strong></p><p>The ACC Freshman of the Year in 2023 when he hit .388, Cannarella played through a shoulder injury in 2024 and then had labrum surgery before the 2025 season. He still hit .353, but his power dropped from 11 home runs to five. He's hit-over-power anyway, with plus speed (although he didn't run the past two seasons because of the shoulder) and is a sure-thing center fielder. No. 27 in Kiley's draft rankings, Cannarella's MLB player comp is Jung-Hoo Lee but with plus center-field defense.</p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png" width="100%"></p><p><strong>Second round</strong><br>
