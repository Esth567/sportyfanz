Both teams were guilty.</p><p>There is a question of whether or not it matters, given the Test ended in a positive result anyway. England have regularly found themselves in trouble because of over-rates, but Ben Stokes would say they are barely ever involved in drawn matches. If the pace of play is not affecting the outcome, what is the issue?</p><p>Spectators who have paid hard-earned cash for expensive tickets and broadcasters who have paid for live action, rather than players getting treatment or trying to get the ball changed, would disagree.</p><p>Stoppages introduced to Test cricket do make bowling 90 overs in a day harder. DRS (decision review system) and concussion examinations are among them. Stokes also argues it is harder if you rely more on pace bowling, which England did at Lord's.</p><p>Very rough calculations using the scorecard show England did bowl their overs slower than India, to the tune of about half an over per hour, across the Test. Still, both were off the 15-per-hour target.</p><p>What is not explained is how the officials decide the time allowances given to each team for injuries. Some more transparency over how these punishments are dished out to would avoid accusations of injustice or favouritism.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="What-are-the-rules" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">What are the rules?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ninety overs are scheduled for each day in a five-day Test match.</p><p>To prevent teams tactically wasting time to ensure a draw, all of the overs must be bowled on the fifth day barring interruptions for the weather but, on the previous days, the overs must be fitted into the six hours of play, with an extra half-hour made available at the end of the day.</p><p>While time can be made up for overs lost to the weather, there is no such provision when the reason is simply slow play. If overs are not bowled in that time they are lost from the match.</p><p>There are some penalties already in place in the International Cricket Council's playing conditions but they have a limited impact.</p><p>An umpire can, after an initial warning, award five penalty runs to an opposition if one team is deemed to be wasting time. This rule has never been enforced in Test cricket.</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
