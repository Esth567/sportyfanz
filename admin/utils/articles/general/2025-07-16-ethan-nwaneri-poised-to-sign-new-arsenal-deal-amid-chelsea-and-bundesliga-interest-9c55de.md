A series of late approaches from Brentford is understood to have been firmed up with an offer shortly before the deadline, but that failed to meet the requirements.</p><p>The bid was spread in instalments, with Ipswich instead requiring cash up front. The expiry of the clause gives Ipswich greater control of the 21-year-old’s destiny but their resolve could still be tested if Brentford return offering a more palatable payment structure. Brentford are undergoing a summer revamp under Keith Andrews and signing Hutchinson, who shone for England in their victorious Uefa Under-21 Championship campaign, would sweeten the expected departure of Bryan Mbeumo.</p></div></div>
