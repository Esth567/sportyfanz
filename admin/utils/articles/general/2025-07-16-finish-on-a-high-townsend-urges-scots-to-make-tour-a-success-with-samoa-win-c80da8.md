"They can get to Melbourne on Sunday the same time as the Lions are arriving. So as long as they are available to train on Monday and be available for the Lions game on Tuesday [against First Nations and Pasifika XV].</p><p>"Discipline can be a number of things that the referee can call you up on, not being offside just giving a bit of space that would be the first one that we can fix, even those borderline calls that we had at the weekend. We've got to take that out of the referee and assistant referee's hands by showing space around the ruck.</p><p>"Off the field it's been excellent and a lot of what the players have been doing in training particularly in the Maori game has been very good so we really want to work towards having that same memories of the tour on the field on Friday night."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Scotland-XV-to-face-Samoa" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Scotland XV to face Samoa</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Scotland:</b> Kyle Rowe, Kyle Steyn, Rory Hutchinson, Stafford McDowall, Arron Reed, Fergus Burke, Jamie Dobie; Rory Sutherland, Ewan Ashman, Elliot Millar Mills, Gregor Brown, Grant Gilchrist, Andy Onyeama-Christie, Rory Darge (capt), Matt Fagerson.</p><p><i>Replacements:</i> George Turner, Nathan McBeth, Fin Richardson, Cameron Henderson, Marshall Sykes, Ben Muncaster, George Horne, Adam Hastings.</p></div></article></main></div></div>
