We didn't change anything.</p><p>"We have a round table every Saturday and look at what we've done and what needs to change. We don't change to the opponents' strategy."</p><p>One of the major health risks concerned with boxing is chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - a brain condition linked to repeated blows to the head and concussion. CTE leads to dementia and can only be diagnosed post-mortem.</p><p>Chycki suggested one of the reasons they monitor Usyk and do cognitive training is to help with the "prevention of brain injury".</p><p>But Dr Thom Wilcockson, a senior lecturer of psychology at Loughborough University, says the scientific evidence is not strong enough to suggest cognitive training prevents CTE.</p><p>"It would add a robustness against fatigue induced cognitive decline but not necessarily the long-term effects that CTE could cause," he said.</p><p>"It would give Usyk a larger cognitive reserve which might help mitigate other types of dementia like Alzheimer's disease."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Usyk is a trailblazer in many ways - he was the first man to become undisputed at heavyweight in the four-belt era - but his training methods aren't unique, resembling those of compatriot Vasiliy Lomachenko.</p><p>They employ alternative and unorthodox techniques in the gym.</p><p>Lomachenko showed cat-like reflexes by catching four coins, one at a time in a single movement, after flicking them into the air off his forearm.</p><p>Usyk went one better in December 2024, performing the trick with both arms simultaneously.</p><p>On the surface it may seem like a party trick, but there is something deeper to it.</p><p>"With boxing there is a very clear relationship between having a fast reaction time and performance," Dr Wilcockson said.</p><p>"Reaction-time training is really beneficial for boxing and training of reaction time would then refine the decision-based reactions, alongside the ability to adapt to strategies and changing situations."</p><p>Affording time to build a strong cognitive base and improve reactions has freed up mental capacity for Usyk to reassign to what he does best - download data.</p><p>Usyk is one of boxing's great problem-solvers. He often grows into a fight as his opponent begins to fatigue.</p><p>During both Fury fights, Usyk was behind on all three judges' scorecards after round seven but won via a decision.</p><p>"By training the brain to perform cognitive tasks under physical exertion, Usyk is building up this resilience against degradation and ensuring he is able to make smart decisions," Dr Wilcockson said.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Fighters-and-their-steel-armour" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Fighters and their 'steel armour'</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the boxing community is far from unified on the benefits of cognitive training.</p><p>"If you made a list of potential contributory factors to success in boxing, you'd probably be writing the list for about a week until you got to the cognitive benefits," said Alan Ruddock, associate professor of sport physiology and performance at Sheffield Hallam.</p><p>"It's impossible to say that it is the thing that sways the fight."</p><p>Ruddock co-founded Sheffield-based company Boxing Science in 2014 and has created training programmes for former world champions Kell Brook, Nicola Adams and more recently Joshua.</p><p>Those one-to-one sessions focus on several areas, including nutrition and strength and condition, but rarely do fighters get in touch for cognitive training.</p><p>"We've always had resistance against physiology and psychology," Ruddock added.</p><p>"It's probably because they create this steel armour around them. It's like they make that psychological element almost impenetrable and they don't want to break it down."</p><p>Usyk, though, has embraced the psychological side of the sport to complement the other areas of his game.</p><p>"The answer is simple," Chycki said when asked why he believes Usyk will beat Dubois. </p><p>"He is a better boxer, he has better technical skills and has a strong mind."</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More boxing from the BBC</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
