Out of the top six clubs, they've spent the least in this three-year cycle - only £325m - and that includes their signing of Florian Wirtz.</p><p>"They've still got plenty of wiggle room with their transfer budget. Plus, a move for for a striker is likely to be paid in instalments, meaning the cost can be spread over multiple seasons."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Liverpools-model-has-been-to-ignore-the-noise" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'Liverpool's model has been to ignore the noise'</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Over the past three seasons Liverpool have had a net transfer spend of -£4m, £96m and £53m respectively according to Transfmarkt.</p><p>For context, Manchester United have had a net spend of £119m, £133m and £190m over their past three campaigns.</p><p>"Liverpool have been outside the top-10 spenders on player signings since 2019, but their model is a classic case of being smarter rather than bigger," said Maguire.</p><p>"Liverpool's model has been to ignore the noise and only buy a player if they truly improve the squad. It's a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/">Moneyball,<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> more analytical approach.</p><p>"Chief executive Michael Edwards does a brilliant job and he never buys players because of external pressure. He doesn't get jittery when fans call for more signings.</p><p>"Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and potentially Isak are big signings, but they all improve the Liverpool squad, and the Reds do have an awful lot of PSR headroom."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Who-else-could-be-interested-in-Isak" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Who else could be interested in Isak?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Newcastle have maintained throughout the summer that their top players - and Isak is certainly one of those - are not for sale.</p><p>Indeed, like Liverpool, Newcastle - who are owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) - are in a comfortable PSR position.</p><p>Isak  has three years left on his contract, so the Swede would most likely have to actively push for a move.</p><p>Apart from Liverpool, few other clubs in the market for a striker could afford Isak's reported £130m price tag.</p><p>"As the most profitable club in Premier League history, Arsenal could easily spend over £200m in the window and have no PSR concerns," said Maguire.</p><p>Despite Isak having been linked with a move to Arsenal, the Gunners are instead expected to reach a full agreement with Sporting for the 73.5m euros (£63.5m) signing of striker Viktor Gyokeres this summer.</p><p>Manchester City are unlikely to be in the market for a striker, with Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush under lengthy contracts.</p><p>It seems doubtful that United would be able to afford Isak's fee without significant player sales, having missed out on Champions League football next season.</p><p>Chelsea have bought strikers Liam Delap and Joao Pedro this window.</p><p>"In theory, Tottenham could also afford Isak," said Maguire. "But whether the player would want to move from a team who finished fifth to one who finished 17th is a whole other story."</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div>
