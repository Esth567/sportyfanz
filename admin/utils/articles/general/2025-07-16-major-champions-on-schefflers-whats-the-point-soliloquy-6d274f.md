Why do I want to win this tournament so bad? That's something that I wrestle with on a daily basis."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Given his standing in the game and the perception that he takes everything in his Texan stride, Scheffler entangling himself with the great imponderable of his existence has naturally caused a stir around Royal Portrush. </p><p>First up in the media tent on Wednesday was JJ Spaun. Just 31 days removed from winning the US Open, the 34-year-old was well-placed to offer his view on Scheffler's comments on the ephemeral sensation of winning. </p><p>"I believe there's some truth behind Scottie's words," said Spaun. </p><p>"Yeah, you do have these high aspirations, these dreams to accomplish things in golf at the highest level, and then you do and it happens so quick. You're so elated, and then all of a sudden it's like, now what?</p><p>"I tried to sink it in as much as possible, and it did, but it's a weird feeling. I never thought I would win a major. A few years ago I was just trying to get in them. So I think, yeah, there's some testament to that."</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Justin Rose speaks to the media on Wednesday" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2a45/live/93376a30-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 976w" width="3840" height="2159.7874224977854"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Rose spoke to reporters on Wednesday morning</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Justin Rose was the next player into the news conference room.

That's the exciting part.</p><p>"What keeps me going is just be better tomorrow as a person and as a golfer than I am today and that's enough. </p><p>"You want it to manifest into tournament wins and ticking off your goals and your dreams, but really the journey and the process of getting there is where you have to try to find the enjoyment."</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Padraig Harrington speaks to reporters " loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1536/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/4146/live/d17e4160-6255-11f0-a369-c988e8a1d1b1.jpg 976w" width="1536" height="864"></picture></span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Speaking to a large group of reporters, Padraig Harrington offered a deeply thoughtful response to Scheffler's remarks</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Padraig Harrington has been around even longer than Rose. What, then, did the three-time major winner make of the Scheffler soliloquy? </p><p>"I don't want to compare myself to him, but I genuinely still have a real love for this game and enjoy every bit," he said. "It brings me tremendous satisfaction and I don't think I have to shy away from that. </p><p>"Just because I love golf doesn't make me a bad father or bad parent. They're separate entities, you can enjoy everything there is about golf and still be good elsewhere. I just love playing golf.</p><p>When pressed about still feeling fulfilled on the course, 30 years after turning pro, he said he still "loves practising, hitting shots and dreaming of what can be". </p><p>Going back to Scheffler, two-time Open champion Harrington added: "He was being honest, but those people are going to ask him about that for a long time.</p><p>"He obviously loves to practice, I just don't think he loves the grind of it. I don't think he needs to separate it. </p><p>"I've often said this later on in my life, I wish I'd spent more time enjoying my wins when they happened."</p><p>Whoever takes the Claret Jug home from Portrush on Sunday, maybe they will have Scheffler's words ringing in their ears. Maybe it will allow them to enjoy an Open win that bit longer. </p></div></article></main></div></div>
