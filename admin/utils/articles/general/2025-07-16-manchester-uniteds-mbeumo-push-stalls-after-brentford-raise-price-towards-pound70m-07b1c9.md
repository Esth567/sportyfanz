A series of late approaches from Brentford is understood to have been firmed up with an offer shortly before the deadline, but that failed to meet the requirements.</p><p>The bid was spread in instalments, with Ipswich instead requiring cash up front. The expiry of the clause gives Ipswich greater control of the 21-year-old’s destiny but their resolve could still be tested if Brentford return offering a more palatable payment structure. Brentford are undergoing a summer revamp under Keith Andrews and are keen on signing Hutchinson, who shone for England in their victorious Uefa Under-21 Championship campaign.</p><p>Bournemouth on Wednesday completed the £25m signing of the goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea on a five-year deal. The Serbia international said: “I came to Bournemouth because I want to grow and I want to play at the best level. Together with this club, with these facilities, I think we can achieve it.”</p></div></div>
