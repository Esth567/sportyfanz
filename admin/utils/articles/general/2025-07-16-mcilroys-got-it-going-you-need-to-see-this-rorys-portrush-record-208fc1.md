He's obviously an absolute superstar now but, truth be told, he was a superstar in the making after that day."</b></p><p>It is 20 years ago, almost to the day, that a 16-year-old Rory McIlroy breezed round Royal Portrush - venue for this week's 153rd Open Championship - in 61 shots to set a new course record.</p><p>Aaron O'Callaghan was one of McIlroy's playing partners that day and says that the curly-haired teenager went to "the next level" over those 18 holes.</p><p>The Cork native is now coach of East Tennessee State University - the institution McIlroy had chosen to attend before deciding to turn professional instead - and remembers the number of people watching the round swell as word got out.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>O'Callaghan first encountered his future Ireland team-mate when McIlroy was still in primary school and was struck by the notion of meeting a world champion of any age.</p><p>"I remember thinking, 'like not just Northern Ireland? Not just Ireland? The best in the world?' And it's just this kid who's grinning from ear to ear," he told BBC Sport.</p><p>That was before he saw him with a club in his hand.</p><p>"He swung the same way he does now. You're watching him with his little cut down driver or cut down seven wood and he's just never missing the centre of the club face. </p><p>"Always right on the button, no toe slappers to the left-side of the fairway. Just flush."</p><p>O'Callaghan would become both a friend and regular playing partner in the years that followed and recalls being "flattered" to be paired alongside McIlroy and another pal, Stephen Crowe, at the North of Ireland Championship in July 2005. </p><p>On the first day of the prestigious competition, a level-par score around the adjacent Valley course meant O'Callaghan had the better of McIlroy by a stroke. Then came the round that changed it all. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Rory McIlroy" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1680/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 976w" width="1680" height="945.1216685979142"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>BBC Sport</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Rory McIlroy is one of just six men to have won golf's career Grand Slam</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>McIlroy had first played the famous Dunluce links to celebrate his 10th birthday.
