        <p>Bill Belichick's first full high school recruiting class as <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UNC/north-carolina-tar-heels/">North Carolina</a> coach got a bump on Wednesday when four-star safety Jakob Weatherspoon flipped his commitment from <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/">Ohio State</a>. Weatherspoon adds an eighth four-star commitment to the class for Belichick and the Tar Heels.</p><p>Weatherspoon, a native of Avon, Ohio, initially committed to Ohio State on Jan. 2 as the Buckeyes were on their run to winning a national championship. North Carolina offered Weatherspoon in February and he ended up making a visit to Chapel Hill in early June. A little more than a month later, he changed his pledge to UNC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weatherspoon is ranked as the No. 233 overall recruit in 2026, according to 247Sports. Additionally, he is ranked as the No. 19 safety and 10th-best prospect in Ohio for his class. He is the 33rd verbal pledge to UNC's 2026 class and comes in as the fourth-highest ranked recruit behind quarterback Travis Burgess (No. 65), wide receiver Keeyun Chapman (No. 192) and defensive lineman Trashawn Ruffin (No. 195).</p>
        

<p>Weatherspoon's flip also bumps North Carolina from No. 20 to No. 17 in <a href="https://247sports.com/season/2026-football/overallteamrankings/" target="_blank">the 247Sports Team Rankings</a>.&nbsp;</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/2025-sec-media-days-takeaways-alabama-fueled-by-disrespect-floridas-billy-napier-may-have-tipped-his-hand/" target="_blank">

<p>While much of the media focus ahead of Belichick's first season has centered on the legendary coach's relationship with girlfriend Jordon Hudson, Belichick -- won famously won six Super Bowls as the coach of the New England Patriots -- has quietly put together <a href="https://247sports.com/college/north-carolina/season/2026-football/commits/" target="_blank">a promising recruiting class</a> that seemingly positions the program well for the future.</p>
        

<p>Ohio State's 2026 class, meanwhile, sits at No. 7 in the team rankings. The class includes two four-star safeties, Blaine Bradford (No. 59) and Simeon Caldwell (No. 119). Bralan Womack, a five-star prospect and the top-ranked safety in the class, will announce his commitment on Aug. 22 and has Ohio State as one of his top schools.&nbsp;</p>
