Clark had attracted attention at the US PGA Championship in May for throwing his driver at a sign during another temper tantrum.</p><p>When asked about the US Open incident, Clark said: “I’ve had a lot of highs and lows in my career, especially this year some lows. I made a mistake that I deeply regret. I’m very sorry for what happened. But I’d also like to move on, not only for myself but for Oakmont, for the USGA [United States <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Golf</a> Association] and kind of focus on the rest of this year and things that come up.”</p><p>Oakmont is clearly unwilling to draw a line under the incident. In a letter to members this week, first obtained by Golf Digest, club president John Lynch outlined Clark’s punishment. “Following multiple discussions with the USGA and the OCC board, a decision has been made that Mr. Clark will no longer be permitted on OCC property,” Lynch said.</p><p>“Reinstatement would be contingent upon Mr Clark fulfilling a number of specific conditions, including full repayment for damages, a meaningful contribution to a charity of the board’s choosing, and the successful completion of counselling and/or anger management sessions.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/wyndham-clark-holds-nerve-to-win-2023-us-open-as-rory-mcilroy-falls-just-short" data-link-name="in body link">Clark held off Rory McIlroy</a> to win the US Open at Los Angeles Country Club in 2023. His best major finish so far this year is a tie for 46th at the Masters. The US Open will return to Oakmont in 2033. Clark will begin his latest quest for the Open at 10.20am on Thursday in the company of Corey Conners and Tom Hoge.</p></div></div>
