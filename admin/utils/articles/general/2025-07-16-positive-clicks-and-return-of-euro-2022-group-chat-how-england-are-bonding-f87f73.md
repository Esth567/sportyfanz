but forward Kelly later had an explanation.</p><p>"We have a little group of us in a [WhatsApp] group chat - 'the finishers' as you call it - and [they were] 'positive clicks'," said the Arsenal winger.</p><p>"You probably saw we were all clicking, thinking 'what are they doing?' But it was just a positive click. We said: 'If one of us comes on and scores, let's do that'. </p><p>"It's just about sticking together and being at our best when called upon, making sure we're prepared to go on the pitch to do a great job."</p><p>Kelly said Walsh would be "kept in the loop" from now on, but the group chat was created by Manchester United captain Maya le Tissier for the substitutes.</p><p>England's super-subs made a big impact at Euro 2022 - Kelly scored the winner in the final against Germany, after Ella Toone had lobbed goalkeeper Merle Frohms in the same match. Alessia Russo produced a memorable backheel finish in the semi-final win over Sweden.</p><p>"Some of us didn't have the pictures of the click celebration so that's where the group chat came from - to send each other the pictures," added Kelly.</p><p>"I was saying to Lotte [Wubben-Moy] that throughout the tournaments that we've been playing in, the group of 'finishers' have been incredible."</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>When the celebration makes it out of the group chat...</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is not the only WhatsApp group chat on the go, as Lucy Bronze revealed last week they still use the one they had at Euro 2022.</p><p>Recently retired goalkeeper Mary Earps has been among those to message the squad in Switzerland, as well as former striker Ellen White.</p><p>"It's just mostly 'good luck', 'well done' or 'we believe in you'," said Williamson when asked about the messages.</p><p>"For them to reinforce their belief in the team and want to be part of it, that speaks volumes of the group.</p><p>"That group chat was originally created for the [Euro 2022] celebrations, so every time it pops up, it's not a bad thing.</p><p>"Most group chats we archive or mute - but not that one. We're very tame though.
