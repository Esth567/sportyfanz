<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><ul><li><p>Associated Press</p></li></ul><p><span>Jul 15, 2025, 04:25 PM ET</span></p></div><p>PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- Don't feel bad for <a data-player-guid="e23e62a8-8995-6b06-42f2-018c8a27e916" href="https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10140/xander-schauffele">Xander Schauffele</a> having to return the Claret Jug when he arrived at Royal Portrush to defend his title in the Open Championship. It's not as if he had anywhere to keep it.</p><p>Schauffele has won eight times in his PGA Tour career, including The Open, the PGA Championship and the Tour Championship. There's also the Olympic gold medal from Tokyo in 2021.</p><p>Where to keep it all? Not at his house. Schauffele said his parents keep all his trophies, "probably in a bank vault." They have a home in San Diego, and his father is building a place on Kauai, living in what Stefan Schauffele calls "the container."</p><p>The gold medal?</p><p>"I actually have no idea where that is, to be completely honest," Schauffele said.</p><p>It's not all that surprising considering how simply Schauffele and his wife, Maya Lowe, prefer to live. He celebrates a little more than <a data-player-guid="38cbeebe-aac8-fb36-dce0-cf45436086e4" href="https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9478/scottie-scheffler">Scottie Scheffler</a>, but, much like with the world's No. 1 player, <a href="https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/45745697/scottie-scheffler-take-success-golf-point">it's on to the next tournament to start over</a>.</p><p>"What am I going to do with it? I don't really invite people over to my house. Am I just going to go look at it myself?" Schauffele said. "I don't want to walk into a trophy room like, 'Look how great I am.' I was just raised to think that way, and it's kind of stuck."</p><p>That begs the question: What is on the shelves of their Florida home if not trophies?</p><p>"My wife hung up some pictures of me in my gym of me winning the Olympic medal, and she put it so high up I can't reach it," Schauffele said. "I have to get a ladder now, and it bothers me. If anything, put up me in a Masters jacket, like that would piss me off, you know what I mean? Something like that is more motivating."</p><p>If it were up to Schauffele, he would hang photos of his dogs. Or nothing. Maybe a clock.</p><p>"I'm always late, so maybe a clock would be good for me," Schauffele said.</p><p>He said Ryder Cup captain <a data-player-guid="8f5653c5-b2c1-8fe7-6f83-fb976c9dec5d" href="https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4513/keegan-bradley">Keegan Bradley</a> has told him to be sure to enjoy big wins, and Schauffele figures he will do that at some point.</p><p>"But right now I really want to keep my head down and keep charging," he said.</p>
