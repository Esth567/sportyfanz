The Reds are ready to do "everything in their power" to land the 24-year-old. They are preparing to send officials to begin talks with <em>Los Blancos</em>, who are believed to be looking for an offer close to €100 million. Any move is expected to take time as the Anfield hierarchy prioritise resolving the future of winger <strong><a data-player-guid="9959537e-af42-929e-a829-cc149924d7f4" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257390/luis-diaz">Luis Díaz</a></strong>, with sources telling ESPN that Bayerrn Munich have already had a bid for the <a data-clubhouse-guid="7f32673e-0a85-dbdd-3380-19cfe5d6c009" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=208">Colombia</a> international rejected.

The two clubs are hopeful of reaching a deal by the end of the week with the Sweden international's transfer set to reach €80m. Sources told ESPN that Gyökeres had agreed personal terms with Arsenal over a five-year deal after the club's sporting director Andrea Berta flew out to <a data-clubhouse-guid="12433baf-649d-7f4f-7233-6db63a5f62f4" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=482">Portugal</a> for direct talks.

A move for Hato, 19, would require an offer in the region of £40m. While no team has made a formal proposal to the <a data-league-guid="e8c15234-75dd-3155-bea5-3a1d9edcfd27" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/NED.1">Eredivisie</a> side yet, Hato is also on Liverpool's shortlist as an alternative to <a data-clubhouse-guid="e8703d92-a160-9bbf-cb81-1be6f3fd7969" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=384">Crystal Palace</a> centre-back <strong><a data-player-guid="476ae006-e5b6-49ac-b037-01ebe4436944" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/265907/marc-guehi">Marc Guéhi</a></strong>.</p><h2>EXPERT TAKE</h2><p><em>ESPN's Alex Kirkland looks at Rodrygo's situation at Real Madrid:</em></p><blockquote><p>Rodrygo's future always promised to be one of the transfer sagas of this summer, and so far it's living up to expectations. The Real Madrid forward's disappearance from the team at the end of last season -- not featuring once since being hauled off at half-time in the Copa del Rey final -- sparked speculation that he could be on the move. Sources have told ESPN that the Brazilian would prefer to stay at Madrid but wanted to play on the left, not the right, and was waiting to hear new coach Xabi Alonso's plans before taking any decisions.</p><p>His involvement at the Club World Cup only increased the doubts. He played 65 minutes against Al Hilal were followed by 23 minutes against Salzburg and just four minutes against Borussia Dortmund, with no involvement at all in the knockout ties with Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain. Alonso called him "important" and "a special player," as you'd expect, but the coach's decisions so far haven't backed up that assessment. Opportunities in the frontline are now going to be even more scarce than previously, given the eruption of Gonzalo Garcia stateside, and with Franco Mastantuono -- another talented young wide forward -- joining in August.</p><p>So what now? Madrid's players are enjoying a well-earned rest, ahead of a return to pre-season training, and their first LaLiga game on Aug. 19, and Arsenal have now been joined by Liverpool in being linked with a bid for Rodrygo. ESPN has reported that Madrid would only consider a transfer if the player asked to leave, and even then, it wouldn't be straightforward, given the club's expectation of a sizeable fee, and Rodrygo's salary demands. Don't expect a resolution anytime soon.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0716/r1519644_1200x800_3-2.png" width="100%"></p><h2>CONFIRMED TRANSFERS</h2><p>- Championship side Derby County have signed Charlotte FC and United States striker <strong>Patrick Agyemang</strong> for a fee is in the region of $7 million. <strong><a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45747642/usa-agyemang-move-championship-derby" target="_blank">Read</a></strong></p><p>- West Ham United have signed Senegal international left-back <strong>El Hadji Malick Diouf</strong> from from Slavia Prague.</p><p>- Aston Villa have signed goalkeeper <strong>Marco Bizot </strong>from Brest.</p><h2>OTHER RUMORS</h2><p>- Inter Milan are prioritising a move for Atalanta winger <strong>Ademola Lookman</strong>.
