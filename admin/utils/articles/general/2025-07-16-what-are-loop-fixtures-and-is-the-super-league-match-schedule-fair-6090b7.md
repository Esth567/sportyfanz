How is each season's schedule drawn up? What makes Super League's fixture list unique?

the third-highest in the league and 246 more than Leigh, who are directly above them. </p><p>It has taken 18 rounds for Saints and Leigh to finally meet, yet they will take each other on again in the penultimate round of fixtures on 12 September - a second meeting in the final nine games before the play-offs.</p><p>Of course, league position at any given point of a season cannot be predicted in advance, but Warrington have had a difficult run-in so far in 2025.</p><p>Not only have the Challenge Cup finalists faced significant injury challenges, their meeting with Salford on 4 July was only the fourth time they had faced an opponent in the bottom four of Super League.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Juggling-the-schedule" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Juggling the schedule</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>When the RFL compile the following season's fixtures late in the preceding year, there are more obstacles to getting the list in order than it initially appears.</p><p>Maximising television audiences, stadium availability and pitch resurfacing can all impact on when teams play and who they will face, with resurfacing sometimes having a prolonged influence on some teams' schedules.</p><p>Wigan played six away games in a row due to work being undertaken on the pitch at the Brick Community Stadium home they share with football club Wigan Athletic, whose season came to an end in May.</p><p>Similarly, Warrington's win against Salford began a run of four consecutive away games with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLiHwe3A25b/?img_index=1">work under way on their pitch<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> at the Halliwell Jones Stadium.</p><p>Other clubs who groundshare with other sports, like St Helens, Salford, Huddersfield and Hull FC, have similar challenges fitting their home games around when their stadiums are in use or having essential maintenance.</p><p>Changes can be made at relatively short notice during the season, with Huddersfield <a href="https://www.giantsrl.com/article/9319/three-games-to-move-date">announcing on Tuesday<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> that three of their upcoming games would move dates due to stadium availability at the Accu Stadium, which they share with football team Huddersfield Town.</p><p>Meanwhile, Leeds cannot play at Headingley, which adjoins the cricket ground of the same name, if there is an England Test match or a Yorkshire T20 Blast game taking place on the same day.</p><p>In a statement issued to BBC Sport, the RFL said: "The development of the fixture list is a complex and time intensive project by several people, as well as a leading software programme.</p><p>"A competition of 12 teams, with a season length of 27 rounds, to include loop fixtures and over 100 requests from the clubs, means it will never be perfect but every attempt is made to ensure it is the best version it can be."</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Tesi Niu of Leigh is tackled by Nick Cotric of Catalans" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1920/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 976w" width="1920" height="1080"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>SWPix</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Catalans have faced Leigh three times this season -
