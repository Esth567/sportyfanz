When he made his Test debut at Twickenham last November, the scale of the occasion, in front of 82,000 people, caught him unawares.</p><p>Speaking to the media this week, he counted the number of microphones and Dictaphones in front of him as an indicator of the interest a Lions tour generates.</p><p>"My old man has always said to me 'it's a big world out there' and rugby brings that," Suaalii said.</p><p>"This is one of the great parts of our game and we should be celebrating it," said Horwill.</p><p>"It is so unique, really to any other sport in the world - four nations coming together with so much tradition, history and so much support, and come out on tour.</p><p>"In Australia, where you're competing every weekend for talent, for sponsors, for fans, for kids playing the game, this means a lot.</p><p>"Kids will watch this and want be part of it one day. You can't overestimate the impact it has."</p><p>Justin Harrison agrees. "It's a real shot in the arm," the former Wallabies second row said.</p><p>"People will be able to see rugby played on the screens when they're walking past pubs. They're going to see a ground swell of people moving towards an event; they're going to hear singing and jocularity and friendly rivalry.</p><p>"Sport is wonderful, but rugby in particular brings the world right into the palm of your hand and we have to make the most of that."</p><p>Horwill and Harrison know, however, that the surest route back to into the limelight is also the simplest: via the pitch.</p><p>"We haven't been able to perform at the level we've wanted to over the last little bit. So ultimately we want some good performances to engage the fickle or casual rugby fan," said Horwill.</p><p>Stephen Moore, a former team-mate of both, believes the ultimate injection of momentum may be at hand.</p><p>"Without wanting to put too much pressure on the current players it is there for them to take," he <a href="https://www.bbc.com/programmes/p0lq70nm">told the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.</a></p><p>"If we can keep our best players on the field, it is a very winnable series for us."</p><p>The Wallabies are playing for themselves, their country and also a whole sport.</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p></section></article></main></div></div>
