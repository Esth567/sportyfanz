The Belgium international earned five caps for his country and retired in 2012 with a spell at third-division KSK Hasselt, having rejected the chance to make the move to Kilmarnock. “I have two children and my wife has a good job. I did not want to move to Scotland on my own,” said De Man.</p><p>It’s not too much of a stretch to say that legendary Italian midfielders Sandro Mazzola and his father, Valentino Mazzola, were both <em><a href="https://learning.coachesvoice.com/cv/what-is-a-mezzala-explained-de-bruyne-di-maria-pogba/" data-link-name="in body link">mezzalas</a></em>. Valentino is regarded by some as the best Italian player of all time. Captain of the <em>Azzurri</em> and Torino – and the symbol of the <em>Grande Torino</em> side that dominated Serie A in the late 1940s, Valentino died at 30 in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/30/newsstory.sport3" data-link-name="in body link">the Superga air disaster</a> in 1949. His son, Sandro was a one-club man with Inter and was a key part of the <em>Grande Internazionale</em> team that seemed unbeatable in the 1960s.</p><p>The story of how Sandro signed with Inter is directly linked to his father’s death. “One day Benito Lorenzi, the Inter forward who played with my father in the Italy team and was a very close friend of his, came to my house,” Sandro told <em>Gazzetta Dello Sport</em>. “He asked my mother to let me go to Milan to become the team’s mascot. Giuseppe Meazza was also greatly affected by the Superga disaster and went out of his way to help my brother and me. The two of us would put on the full Inter kit, walk out with the players and stay by the side of the pitch during the matches. Even as mascots we were on bonuses and we used to get 10,000 lire for a win and 5,000 for a draw. It was a lot of money for our family.” The gesture later convinced Sandro that Inter were the team for him. With nearly 500 club appearances for the <em>Nerazzurri</em> between 1963-74, Sandro – known as ‘<em>Il Baffo</em>’ owing to his trademark moustache – was an attacking creative midfielder linking the wingers and forwards and played in three World Cups for Italy, won the 1968 European Championship and finished second in the 1971 Ballon d’Or rankings.</p><p>Dave Adams reminds us of former Portsmouth attacker John Utaka, the club’s record signing when he joined from Rennes in July 2007 for £7m. The striker did little to justify <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/10/portsmouth-wages-waste-of-money" data-link-name="in body link">his £80,000-a-week salary</a>, which was a huge burden for a debt-ridden club that was threatened with administration and placed under a transfer embargo.</p><p>“Lennart Wing, the great Swedish wing-half as an obvious starting point alongside the Wycombe full-back Fin Back (who gets extra points for his initials matching his role),” suggests Richard Wilson. “A far less obvious player would be Vuk Strikovic, who nominative determinism of course demands that he play up front. At 23, he has 36 goals in 131 Montenegrin league games.”</p><p>“Buried in a Reddit thread, we found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/145a7xu/comment/jnl4q93/" data-link-name="in body link">this post</a> by someone named ZedGenius. In Greek the syllables ‘-akis’ are an endearing way of saying a name and it has the meaning of ‘small’, like ‘-inho’ does in Portuguese, with which I assume more people are familiar with. For example, Giorgos, becomes Giorgakis, and is usually a name that’s used for kids named Giorgos. Similarly, Giannis would become Giannakis. Now that this is out of the way, the player I wanted to mention is Michalis Bakakis, who plays as a right back (Back-akis, which if you were to translate it would give you something of the sorts of’ ‘small back man’).”</p><figure id="fb19e97b-5674-449d-80c8-cbea4d760aa8" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Michalis Bakakis in action for AEK Athens on a lovely sunny day at Celtic Park in 2018." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Michalis Bakakis in action for AEK Athens on a lovely sunny day at Celtic Park in 2018.</span> Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>“The best I can offer is my team Farnborough, formerly Farnborough Town, having a winger called Phil Wingfield,” emails Matthew Wilkie. “Also playing at Kingstonian, he literally took to the field on the wing.”</p><p>“Michael Wright played at right back for Villa, mainly in the 70s,” writes Glyn Berrington.

Bayern eliminated Malmö FF in the round of 16, thanks to a 2-0 victory on 5 November 1975.

How much above 90F is anyone’s guess, but even that is 32.2C in today’s money. On 35 mins, City’s Irvine Thornley left the pitch with sunstroke. Before half-time, he was joined by teammate Jimmy Conlin, who had started the game with a handkerchief tied on his head. City began the second half 0-2 down and with nine men, but in the 50th minute Conlin, plus handkerchief, returned to set up George Dorsett to make it 1-2. That was as good as it got for City, and before long they were reduced to eight men, losing their scorer and Bob Grieve to heat exhaustion.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-18" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“The ref consulted his linesmen, but they agreed there was no just cause for abandoning the game. Woolwich scored two more to win 4-1, by which time City’s Tommy Kelso and James Buchan had also retired, so they finished the game with five fit men and the plucky Conlin. The Daily Mail reported that Arsenal were clearly the fitter and better-prepared team, and chose not to take advantage of their opponents’ misfortune.”</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/brentford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report" data-link-name="in body link">Brentford’s 4-0 win over Manchester United</a> in August 2022 is certainly a contender to beat that day in 1906.
