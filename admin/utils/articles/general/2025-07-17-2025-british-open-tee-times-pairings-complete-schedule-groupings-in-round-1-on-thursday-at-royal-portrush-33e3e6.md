        <p>The Open Championship tees off Thursday morning at Royal Portrush with the best golfers in the world vying for the final major of the season in Northern Ireland. This 2025 Open will result in some early mornings -- or late nights, depending on your vantage point -- for fans stateside if they hope to keep up with their favorite players.</p><p>As is always the case at the four majors, many of the biggest stars and <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-british-open-odds-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-jon-rahm-top-favorites-at-royal-portrush/" target="_blank">Open Championship favorites</a></span> will be paired together in the first two rounds.

Spaun and Jon Rahm, as the 2024 Open champion will begin his title defense alongside the U.S. Open champion and one of the favorites to win this year's Claret Jug. In the next group out at 5:09 a.m., world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will begin his quest for a first Open title alongside two men who have won one already in Collin Morikawa and Shane Lowry. Of course, it was Lowry who won The Open the last time it was held at Royal Portrush.</p><p>In the afternoon wave, there are three notable featured groups that will go off in succession, starting with Robert MacIntyre, Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Rose at 9:48 a.m.; followed by Jordan Spieth, Ludvig Åberg and Viktor Hovland at 9:59 a.m.; with Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Tommy Fleetwood bringing up the rear at 10:10 a.m. McIlroy is looking for his second major title of the season and his first Open win in his home country of Northern Ireland in what may be his best chance to win on that soil.</p>
