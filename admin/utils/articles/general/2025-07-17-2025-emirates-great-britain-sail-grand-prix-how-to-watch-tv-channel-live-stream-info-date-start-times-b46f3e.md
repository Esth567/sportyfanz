        <p>SailGP is coming back to the UK this weekend for the first time since Season 3 with Emirates Great Britain Sail Grand Prix taking place in Portsmouth in The Solent from July 19-20. The 12-strong F50 flee will take on the new location in front of a crowd of 20,000 people.</p><p>The racers have little experience racing on these waters, which could end up being a factor for the competition. The conditions are described as sometimes having strong tides with an unstable sea state.&nbsp;</p><p>Dylan Fletcher's Emirates GBR team is currently fourth on the leaderboard and will be on home soil -- or, in this case, water. He <a href="https://sailgp.com/news/25/emirates-gbr-dylan-fletcher-portsmouth-team-chance-right-wrongs-recent-events" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said</a> the waters are "very tidally influenced," with "wavy water," and uncertain wind conditions. There is a chance for "typical sea breeze" which would make for "spectacular racing."</p><p>Sail GP is coming off a race in New York that took place from June 7-8. Diego Botin's Spain came away with the win, beating New Zealand and France in a winner-take-all shootout. Spain, which holds the record as the youngest team to compete in SailGP, is currently sitting at No. 1, following back-to-back wins.&nbsp;</p><p>"We've seen that there's a bit of an up-and-down leaderboard, so we're quietly confident that we just need to work away on our own, do a good job and we'll be exactly where we want to be," Fletcher said as he and his crew prepare for the race.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Fletcher said being at home does add another element to the race, with a busier schedule and more pressure.</p><p>BONDS Flying Roos, New Zealand and Emirates GBR are two frontrunners for the race.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to watch Portsmouth race</h2><h3>Race 1</h3><p><strong>Date: </strong>Saturday, July 19&nbsp;<br><strong>Time:</strong>&nbsp;11 a.m. ET<br><strong>Where:</strong>&nbsp;Portsmouth, England<br><strong>TV:</strong>&nbsp;CBS<br><strong>Online streaming:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fuboTV</a>&nbsp;(Try for free.
