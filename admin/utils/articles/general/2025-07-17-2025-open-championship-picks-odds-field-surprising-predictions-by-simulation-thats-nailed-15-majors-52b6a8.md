        <p>Tommy Fleetwood heads into the 2025 Open Championship in arguably the best form of his career, racking up 11 top-25 finishes in 14 events played this season. He finished T2 in the Travelers Championship after faltering on the final few holes, so he remains winless on the PGA Tour in his career. Fleetwood has finished inside the top five at all four major championships, including a runner-up finish in the 2019 Open Championship. He is 20-1 in the 2025 Open Championship odds, with the first round at Royal Portrush set for Thursday, July 17. </p><p>World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is the +450 favorite (risk $100 to win $450), while Rory McIlroy is +700 and Jon Rahm is 12-1 heading into the first Thursday tee times at 1:35 a.m. ET. Which one of those golfers offers the most value with 2025 Open Championship bets? Before locking in your 2025 Open Championship picks, be sure to <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.</p><p>This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- and the 2025 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed its <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/" target="_blank">sports betting</a> picks could have seen massive returns on <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">betting sites</a></span>. New users have the opportunity to take advantage of the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/">FanDuel promo code</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/">DraftKings promo code</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanatics-promo-code/">Fanatics Sportsbook promo code</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Now that the 2025 Open Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>2025 Open Championship predictions&nbsp;</h2><p>One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Open Championship: McIlroy, a five-time major champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top five. Many experts thought McIlroy's career Grand Slam achievement at the Masters earlier this year would relieve any pressure on him and potentially lead to many more wins this season. However, he has instead been struggling since then, failing to record a top-five finish in six straight tournaments.</p><p>McIlroy barely made the cut at the PGA Championship and was not in contention throughout the weekend at the U.S. Open. He ranks 166th on the PGA Tour in driving accuracy, which could be a costly metric at Royal Portrush. McIlroy missed the cut in this event last year, and the model does not see any value on him at short odds this year.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">See who else to fade here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Another surprise: Justin Thomas, a 50-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.</p><p>Thomas is a two-time major winner and has recorded one win and seven top-10 finishes this season. However, his recent form in majors is why he's fetching such long odds at the 2025 Open Championship. He finished T-36 at the Masters in April before missing the cut at the PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Despite those results, Thomas remains one of the best putters on tour, ranking first in putting average (1.669), fourth in putts per round (27.86) and 12th in strokes gained: putting (0.501). If he's striking the ball well at Royal Portrush, he'll have a great shot at winning another major championship.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">See who else to pick here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>The model's outright best bets include four golfers going off at +2500 or higher, including two mammoth triple-digit longshots. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">You can only see the model's picks here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
