        <p>Up until Wednesday night, just two of the 32 second-round picks in the 2025 <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/">NFL Draft</a> were under contract as rookies began reporting to training camps. However, a major domino seems to have fallen that could open the floodgates for those second rounders to put pen to paper.</p><p>Defensive tackle <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168167/alfred-collins/">Alfred Collins</a>, who was selected by the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/">San Francisco 49ers</a> with the No. 43 overall pick in the draft out of Texas, has agreed to his four-year, $10.3 million rookie deal, which includes $9 million in guaranteed money, <a href="https://x.com/AdamSchefter/status/1945660642628936178" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">per ESPN</a>. Collins is the first second-round pick to concede a fully-guaranteed contract, which is <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-what-is-holding-up-nfl-draft-second-rounders-from-signing-rookie-deals/" target="_blank">the reason players drafted from picks No. 35 to No. 64 have yet to sign their deals</a></span>, and he may even be viewed as somewhat of a hero to the other <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a> franchises.&nbsp;</p><p>In early May, the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/">Houston Texans</a> gave wide receiver <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26708551/jayden-higgins/">Jayden Higgins</a>, who was selected with the No. 34 overall pick, an unprecedented rookie deal by guaranteeing his full contract. Then, the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/">Cleveland Browns</a> followed suit by guaranteeing linebacker <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26724333/carson-schwesinger/">Carson Schwesinger</a>, the No. 33 pick, his full rookie contract as well. This led the other second-round picks to begin fighting for fully-guaranteed contracts, with <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/">Los Angeles Chargers</a> wideout <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162525/tre-harris/">Tre Harris</a> even&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chargers-wr-tre-harris-becomes-first-rookie-training-camp-holdout-and-he-may-not-be-the-last/" target="_blank">holding out of training camp</a></span>.</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/33-nfl-rookies-who-could-hold-out-of-training-camp-two-first-round-picks-and-30-second-rounders-crack-list/" target="_blank">

<p>While Collins' decision to sign his mostly-guaranteed contract will likely lead other second-round picks to do the same, there will be some who continue to fight for more guaranteed money. Take quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964064/tyler-shough/">Tyler Shough</a> for example. As the new potential starting quarterback for the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/">New Orleans Saints</a> following the retirement of <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1664819/derek-carr/">Derek Carr</a>, the Louisville product has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-what-is-holding-up-nfl-draft-second-rounders-from-signing-rookie-deals/" target="_blank">fighting behind the scenes&nbsp;</a>for a fully-guaranteed rookie deal.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Collins signing a rookie contract that guarantees 88% of his money is not a big concession compared to years past, but it's a major development this year and should break the seal for other <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/">NFL teams</a> to start getting their Day 2 picks under contract.&nbsp;</p>
