[I'm] proud to get here and proud of the achievement," Fulton told the Timberwolves YouTube channel after the game.</p><p>"I wish I could have contributed a little bit more but it was definitely a cool moment and cool experience being out there.</p><p>"[My] family and a few friends made the journey over. It's really special. They've supported me the whole way and everyone is buzzing back home as well so it's been great."</p><p>Fulton, whose father Adrian Fulton was an Ireland international, was not selected in the NBA draft, but linked up with the Timberwolves - who chose French forward Joan Beringer in the first round and, after trading back, Australian Rocco Zikarsky in the second.</p><p>He has been with the team in Las Vegas for the NBA's Summer League, which is pre-season competition for teams to showcase new and upcoming players.</p><p>After not featuring in the Timberwolves first games of the competition, Fulton said he got the nod from head coach Chris Finch on the morning of the game.</p><p>"Coach kind of talked about it at breakfast, just to say 'stay ready and you might get your opportunity today' so that's all I've been doing and grateful for the opportunity," Fulton added.</p><p>"[I was] thrown in the deep end but that's how it is. I wish I could have done a bit more but still really cool being out there and another great team win.</p><p>"The support from back home, the whole country is supporting me and hopefully I can inspire a few players down the line just to keep working and show them that reaching this stage is possible."</p></div></article></main></div></div>
