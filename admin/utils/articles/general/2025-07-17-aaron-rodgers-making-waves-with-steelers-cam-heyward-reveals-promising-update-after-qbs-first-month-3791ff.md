        <p>Cam Heyward is one of the leaders within the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>' organization and as far as he sees it, quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/">Aaron Rodgers</a> has <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-signing-with-steelers-four-time-nfl-mvp-joining-pittsburgh-on-one-year-deal/" target="_blank">done everything he can to fit in with his new surroundings</a></span>. Rodgers signed a one-year deal with Steelers in June <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-hints-2025-will-be-his-swan-song-ranking-five-best-final-seasons-in-nfl-history/" target="_blank">and has already hinted this is likely his final NFL season</a></span>.</p><p>It would be easy for the four-time MVP to go about his business and play the position, but Rodgers has been engaged and willing according to Heyward.</p><p>"It just felt like he has bought in, and it worked out for the best," Heyward said this week on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thbL53U8ZGE" target="_blank">"The Rich Eisen Show"</a>. "I know sometimes we live in a society where we want things now. But patience has a way of paying off. And to now see he's a Pittsburgh Steelers and just him walking through the locker room asking questions how we do things, he's bought in and that's all I can ask for our quarterback.&nbsp;</p><p>"As a teammate, I'm excited to go work with him."</p><p>Heyward has been a focal point on Pittsburgh's defense since 2011 and is coming off his fourth first-team All-Pro nod after managing eight sacks last season. He's part of a unit that should be one of the league's best this fall, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/new-steelers-cornerback-jalen-ramsey-takes-jersey-number-that-had-been-worn-by-another-pittsburgh-veteran/" target="_blank">headlined by the recent acquisition</a></span> of <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071515/jalen-ramsey/">Jalen Ramsey</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071793/t-j-watt/">T.J.

<p>Rodgers spent the last two seasons with <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> with subpar results&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-signing-with-steelers-four-time-nfl-mvp-joining-pittsburgh-on-one-year-deal/" target="_blank">before coming to terms with the Steelers</a>. Pittsburgh hopes Rodgers brings some momentum back to an offense that has failed to show in the postseason in recent years. The Steelers haven't won a playoff game since the 2016 season,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/winners-losers-from-aaron-rodgers-joining-steelers-dk-metcalf-gets-boost-steelers-still-bad/" target="_blank">much of that do to struggling to find a difference-maker</a>&nbsp;at the position since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/493043/ben-roethlisberger/">Ben Roethlisberger</a>'s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ben-roethlisberger-retires-from-the-nfl-after-18-seasons-with-the-steelers/" target="_blank">retirement a few years ago</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Rodgers' exit from New York <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-breaks-silence-qb-sounds-off-on-ugly-jets-exit-steelers-plans-willingness-to-play-for-10m/" target="_blank">included a tenuous meeting</a></span> that he said came as a surprise. Prior to free agency, Rodgers alleged that "20 seconds" into a sit-down with both Jets coach Aaron Glenn and new general manager Darren Mougey, New York's brass questioned if he still desired to play.</p><p>"I (didn't) want any part of that. It was already a debacle," Rodgers told <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1674129/pat-mcafee/">Pat McAfee</a> this offseason.</p>
        

<p>Pittsburgh gives Rodgers a fresh start for a storied franchise anchored by veterans like Heyward and long-time coach Mike Tomlin. Heyward's complimentary assessment of Rodgers has been echoed throughout the building this summer. <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-hosts-several-steelers-teammates-for-private-workouts-ahead-of-training-camp/" target="_blank">The quarterback recently hosted tight ends and wide receivers</a></span> for a private workout in Malibu, California, a team-bonding effort of sorts.</p>
