Likewise McCarthy, who has played his way into the second row alongside skipper Itoje. </p><p>The outstanding Sheehan was a shoo-in at hooker, while Furlong, Beirne, Curry and Conan all have Lions Test match experience, which would have been a decisive factor in their selections.</p><p>Chessum is unlucky not to start, but has the consolation of making the matchday squad, while Morgan is doubly unlucky and couldn't have done much more. </p><p>Behind the scrum, Gibson-Park and Russell have been the Test half-backs from a long way out, while the injuries to Garry Ringrose, Mack Hansen and  Kinghorn means the rest of the backline almost picks itself. </p><p>Bundee Aki against Tuipulotu would have been close, with Farrell understandably opting for the Scottish connection and using Aki's power as an impact from the bench. </p><p>Talking of the replacements, Farrell suggested his son Owen needs some more game-time, while Marcus Smith's ability to cover full-back has helped get him the nod over namesake Fin.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Thrilled-for-Curry-but-hard-on-Morgan" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Thrilled for Curry but hard on Morgan</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p><i>Former Lion Ugo Monye on the Rugby Union Weekly podcast:</i></p><p>We spoke about the fight for the number seven shirt a year ago in terms of who was going to be in the touring party, let alone who was going to start the first Test. It has gone to Tom Curry and I'm thrilled for him and everyone else that has been selected.</p><p>If you have given everything and played really well and there is nothing more that can be asked of you, not being selected can leave you slightly baffled, asking "what more could I have done?". </p><p>Jac Morgan is probably in that place right now. "Maybe my face just doesn't fit. Maybe I'm not the right mould of seven."</p><p>It could just be for this game, we will see how Tom Curry plays this weekend. There is still a lot of tour to be played. Morgan is the one out of everyone not selected to have every reason to be slightly miffed.</p><p>I have to say that anyone who plays at seven for the Lions is going to do a brilliant job. Morgan has been superb, then you have former world player of the year Josh Van der Flier, who has loads of experience. Anyone could do a cracking job, as you would expect on a Lions tour, because you are dealing with the best of the best.</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div>
