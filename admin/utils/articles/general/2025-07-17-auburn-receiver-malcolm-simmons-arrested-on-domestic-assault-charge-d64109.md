<p>Simmons was a highly-touted four-star recruit out of Alexander City (Ala.), but now his future with the team is unclear.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Auburn is coming off its fourth straight losing season in 2024, which is the program's longest such streak since 1946-50. The Tigers finished 5-7, and won just two of eight SEC Games. Coach Hugh Freeze is 11-14 in his two seasons with the Tigers, who are slated to kick off the season against <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAYLOR/baylor-bears/">Baylor</a> Aug. 29.&nbsp;</p>
