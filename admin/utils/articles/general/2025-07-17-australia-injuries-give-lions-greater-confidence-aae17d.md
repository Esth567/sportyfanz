Sport website and app with post-match analysis on iPlayer, BBC Radio 5 Live and Rugby Union Weekly podcast.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>The British and Irish Lions will have even "greater confidence" of beating Australia in the first Test after seeing the Wallabies' under-strength line-up, says Ugo Monye.</b></p><p>The tourists were favourites to win this summer's three-match series, as they did on their last visit Down Under in 2013, but former Lions wing Monye says Andy Farrell's side will be boosted by some notable absentees in the Australia XV.</p><p>Australia head coach Joe Schmidt has named a team without experienced lock Will Skelton and powerful back row Rob Valetini, who both have calf injuries, for the opening Test in Brisbane.</p><p>"Without Skelton and Valetini, Australia are underpowered and it takes away some of their super strengths," Monye, who toured South Africa with the Lions in 2009, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sounds/play/p0lqnlxj">told BBC Rugby Union Weekly</a>. </p><p>"The Lions were favourites before we even saw their squad. </p><p>"Now we have seen their team and the Australian team, there is a greater sense of confidence."</p><p>The hosts have also handed rookie fly-half <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cjelg5ykvd3o">Tom Lynagh, the son of Wallaby great Michael, a first Test start</a> in the absence of regular number 10 Noah Lolesio.</p><p>The Lions, meanwhile, have named a formidable line-up of Test stars, which includes a powerful back row and an all-Scotland midfield.</p><p>Tom Curry has been selected at open-side flanker in the most hotly contested position, after fending off fierce competition from Jac Morgan and former world player of the player Josh van der Flier. </p><p>Monye added: "It has gone to Tom Curry and I'm thrilled for him and everyone that has been selected.</p><p>"Jac Morgan is probably the one out of everyone not selected to have every reason to be slightly miffed.</p><p>"Morgan has been superb and then you also have a former world player of the year with loads of experience. </p><p>"Anyone who plays at seven is going to do a brilliant job, as you would expect on a Lions tour because you are dealing with the best of the best. </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Curry-a-serious-threat-at-the-breakdown" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'Curry a serious threat at the breakdown'</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Monye says Curry's power at the breakdown and his versatility may have edged the contest in his favour for the number seven jersey.</p><p>The Englishman will play alongside Ireland number eight Jack Conan and Tadhg Beirne, who is usually a lock but has been chosen over Ollie Chessum at blind-side flanker.</p><p>"Tom Curry is so destructive and it all starts with mindset. He puts 100% into 100% of all his involvement," said Monye.</p><p>"It takes a certain body type and a certain personnel and, more than anything, the mentality of throwing your body into everything. Head in the spokes and trying to deconstruct every ruck he is involved in. </p><p>"What he does over the ball is remarkable. He is a serious threat at the breakdown and I think his link play has actually got a lot better and he has benefited from playing multiple different positions."</p><p>The Aussies, meanwhile, have picked debutant Nick Champion de Crespigny at number six and Fraser McReight at seven.</p><p>Former Wallabies hooker Stephen Moore says McReight is among Australia's "world class" stars who will have to step up if they are to overcome the Lions.</p><p>"Will Skelton has been playing very well in Europe for La Rochelle and Rob Valetini was the best player in Australia this year in Super Rugby," Moore told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.</p><p>"Fraser McReight is also in that category.</p><p>"The breakdown is going to be key and if Australia win there they will win the game.</p><p>"They will want to control the tackle and then the speed of the ball."</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Rob Valetini and Will Skelton" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1600/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/b730/live/f4bfd960-6307-11f0-b1b9-2b94c1f6d9f3.png 976w" width="1600" height="900"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Australia will be without Rob Valetini and Will Skelton for the first Test against the British and Irish Lions </p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Stop-the-centres-you-stop-Australia" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'Stop the centres, you stop Australia'</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Wallabies may be underpowered in the pack, but Monye says the hosts' centre pairing of Len Ikitau and Joseph Suaalii is their "X-factor".</p><p>The Lions have opted for continuity in midfield by deploying Scotland pair Huw Jones and Sione Tuipulotu, who is all too aware of Suaalii's credentials.</p><p>Australian born Scottish captain Tuipulotu said he was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cn0zp4z70zlo">hit "so clean" in a thumping tackle by the 21-year-old</a> in their last meeting at Murrayfield.</p><p>Monye, who describes the match-up as an "unbelievable" head-to-head, believes the Lions will need to starve Australia's midfield of the ball.</p><p>"What Ikitau and Suaalii can do and how interchangeable they are is X-factor," said Monye.</p><p>"There is X-factor with Tuipulotu and Jones as well but that is almost in their pairing and their chemistry together. </p><p>"The point of difference for Australia is in the centres and I'm just nudging towards them.
