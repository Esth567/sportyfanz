        <p>The best of the best are set to compete at the 2025 Open Championship when the final major of the year tees off on Thursday at 1:35 a.m. ET&nbsp;at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland. Xander Schauffele is the defending champion and with another British Open victory, he'll become the first golfer to repeat at The Open since Padraig Harrington accomplished the feat in 2007-08. Schauffele has finished T-12 or better in two of the three majors this season, but should he be included in your 2025 Open Championship bets? </p><p>According to the latest 2025 Open Championship odds, Schauffele is +2500 (risk $100 to win $2,500) to repeat. Scottie Scheffler, the No. 1-ranked player in the world, is the +450 betting favorite. Other 2025 Open Championship contenders include Rory McIlroy (+750), Jon Rahm (+1200), Bryson DeChambeau (+2000) and Tommy Fleetwood (+2600).

Spieth has racked up 13 career victories on the PGA Tour, which includes winning three major championships. He won the Open Championship in 2017 and has finished T-8 or better in two of his last four starts at The Open.</p><p>Spieth has all the tools and experience needed to be in the mix again this year at Royal Portrush. He enters the 2025 Open Championship ranked 18th in strokes gained: total (0.967), 24th in putting average (1.729) and 36th in strokes gained: off the tee (0.302). </p>
        

<p>"It was 2017 when Spieth won the Open Championship, so we know he has the links chops as well," Kannon said. "I feel like he is starting to show some signs that he can win again. It was back in June when he finished seventh at the Memorial, which was his third top-10 of the season."&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-predictions-top-picks-props-longshots-and-pga-golfers-to-fade-this-week/#ttag=07092025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_Kannon_OpenChampionship" target="_blank">See who else to back here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 British Open picks </h2><p>Kannon has locked in his best bets for the 2025 Open Championship and has also selected two epic longshots who are priced over 75-1.
