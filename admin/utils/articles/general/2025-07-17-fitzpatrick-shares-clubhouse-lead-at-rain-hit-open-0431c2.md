He had a laugh and thought I was being sarcastic but I said 'deadly serious' and could he sign a glove as well."</p><p>Home favourite Rory McIlroy, who famously hit his opening shot out of bounds six years ago, avoided the same fate this year but is among the later starters and teed off at 15:10 BST, alongside 2019 runner-up Tommy Fleetwood.</p><p>The weather was dry as they headed out but more rain is forecast to hit the Antrim coast.</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Mickelson saves par from the bunker</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="English-trio-shine-amid-the-gloom" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">English trio shine amid the gloom</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Fitzpatrick, who played in the worst of the conditions, holed a 22-foot eagle putt on the second and added birdies on the short sixth and long 12th to be well in contention at three under.</p><p>But an errant tee shot into the ravine on the par-three 16th - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c5ykv859kxqo">called Calamity Corner</a> because it has wrecked many a round - looked set to cost him. </p><p>His ball nestled in the rough, around eight feet below the green. He flicked it out with a wedge and could only laugh with his caddie after the ball disappeared straight into the hole.</p><p>The Yorkshireman's best finish at the Open is joint 20th at Portrush in 2019 and he arrived in Northern Ireland in good form after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c2d08w1yej2o">a joint fourth at last week's Scottish Open.</a></p><p>Jordan, who grew up at Royal Liverpool and finished joint 10th there after being given the honour of hitting the opening tee shot at the 2023 Open, briefly got to four under with a birdie on the 12th. Successive bogeys were followed by a birdie on the 15th in a fine opening round.</p><p>Westwood also got to four under, with a birdie on the 12th, but bogeys on the 14th and 16th holes dampened the end to his round of 69.</p><p>The former world number one, 52, only booked his place in the championship by coming through final qualifying at Dundonald earlier in July.</p><p>His wife Helen, who is also his caddie, had been planning a boat trip round the French Riviera, instead she has been lugging his bag round in the rain.</p><p><b>More to follow.</b></p></div></article></div>
