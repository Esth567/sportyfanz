But Villa might be advised to delete Chelsea’s number for the next few weeks: according to some of today’s rags, Chelsea’s main transfer target this summer is Villa’s potential superstar <strong>Morgan Rogers</strong>. Just as Pep Guardiola dreams of a team of midfielders, so Chelsea’s recruitment department are moving ever closer to an XI made up solely of attacking midfielders and wide forwards.</p><p>Milan and Man Utd are also engaged in an entirely metaphorical arm wrestle for the Brighton left-back <strong>Pervis Estupiñán</strong>, who fancies a new challenge and will sure as flip get one if he joins either of those two.</p><p>Detestors of all things Man Utd will be pleased to know we’re almost done with them for today.
