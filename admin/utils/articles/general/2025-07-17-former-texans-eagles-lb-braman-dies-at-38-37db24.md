He was 38.</p><p>Braman had undergone multiple surgeries during treatment in Seattle, according to a GoFundMe page set up to help him with expenses. Braman had been diagnosed with cancer in February.</p><p>Agent Sean Stellato confirmed Braman's death Thursday, noting that Braman had two daughters, ages 11 and 8.</p><p>"Bryan, people saw this enormous human being, but his heart was big as his body," Stellato <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/sports/2025/07/17/ex-texans-lb-bryan-braman-dies-from-rare-cancer-his-heart-was-as-big-as-his-body-he-was-special/">told KPRC 2</a> in Houston. "His spirit was so motivating. He was so real and genuine with everybody. That made him special.</p><p>"It's hard. I feel like I lost my firstborn. This kid, he gave me his bed every time I came to Philadelphia. He would threaten me if I didn't stay with him. That's something I'll always cherish. My heart hurts today."</p><p>The GoFundMe for Braman raised more than $88,000, with former Texans star J.J. Watt giving $10,000 and other former teammates also contributing.</p><p>"Rest in Peace brother," Watt <a href="https://x.com/JJWatt/status/1945820572564271292">wrote on social media</a>. "Gone far too soon."</p><blockquote>â€” JJ Watt (@JJWatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/JJWatt/status/1945820572564271292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p>Braman played seven seasons in the NFL, from 2011 to 2017. He won a Super Bowl with the Eagles after joining the team for the playoffs, blocking a punt in the divisional round. The Super Bowl LII victory was Braman's final NFL game.</p><p>"You look at his journey and beating the odds to make it to the NFL after going undrafted," Stellato said. "Not only making it, but producing and becoming a world champion, he had a real hard journey. In life, we all run this race. To die at age 38, the game of football and his family are hurting today. He was a staple for what football and underdogs are about."</p>
