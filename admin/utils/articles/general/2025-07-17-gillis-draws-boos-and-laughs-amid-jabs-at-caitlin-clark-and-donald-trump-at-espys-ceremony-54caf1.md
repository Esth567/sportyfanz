description: "Comedian gets mixed response at awards ceremony  Simone Biles and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander win main prizes  Comedian Shane Gillis’s opening monologue as host at the Espys awards ceremony went over awkwardly in front of some of the biggest names in sports on Wednesday night. Early on, he called out various famous faces in the Dolby Theatre crowd in Los Angeles, including retired WNBA star Diana Taurasi, who received the Icon Award later in the evening. Gillis asked the crowd to “give it up Taurasi”, but only after he had called the six-time Olympic champion “Deanna.” The camera showed an unsmiling Taurasi shaking her head.

While some in the audience laughed, others appeared uncomfortable.</p><p>Gillis continued on for 10 minutes, drawing a scattering of boos at one point, with jokes about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Donald Trump</a> and Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>“Donald Trump wants to stage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/05/trump-ufc-white-house-authoritarian-spectacle" data-link-name="in body link">a UFC fight on the White House lawn</a>. The last time he staged a fight in DC, Mike Pence almost died,” Gillis said. He then turned to Epstein, saying: “There was supposed to be an Epstein joke here, but I guess it got deleted.” Last week, the justice department and the FBI <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-justice-department-fbi-review-confirms" data-link-name="in body link">announced that a review of the case </a>files had confirmed that Epstein had killed himself, and there was no list of his clients to be made public.</p><p>Gillis’ performance drew mixed reviews on social media, with some praising his criticism of Trump, while others criticized the racially charged reference to Clark at a time when WNBA players <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/19/caitlin-clark-angel-reese-wnba-basketball" data-link-name="in body link">have been the subject of online bigotry</a>. Gillis was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/shane-gillis-snl-cast-racist-comments" data-link-name="in body link">dropped from the Saturday Night Live cast</a> in 2019 after podcast footage surfaced of him making racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments. Gillis apologized at the time, saying in a statement he was “a comedian who pushes boundaries” but who “sometimes missed”. He returned to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/25/saturday-night-live-shane-gillis-host" data-link-name="in body link">guest host the show in 2024</a>.</p><p>Gillis was on safer ground when he took a light jab at reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Canadian star, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/23/oklahoma-city-thunder-nba-finals" data-link-name="in body link">won the NBA title</a> with the Oklahoma City Thunder in June, has attracted criticism for drawing fouls during games. He smiled when Gillis said: “SGA is here. Everybody sitting around him is in foul trouble.”</p><p>Gillis also got a good reception for a joke about former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick and his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson. “A bookie is what Bill Belichick reads to his girlfriend before bedtime,” said Gillis of the 73-year-old.</p><p>Before he ended his monologue, a smiling Gillis said, “I see a lot of you don’t like me and that’s OK. That’s it for me. That went about exactly how we all thought it was going to go. I don’t know why this happened.”</p><p>Gilgeous-Alexander and Simone Biles were named as best male and female athletes once the ceremony got under way. Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder to the franchise’s first title in Oklahoma City while also leading the NBA in scoring. “It’s a dream come true and for dreams to come true it takes a village,” he said, thanking his wife, parents, brother and others. “Those names probably don’t mean much but to me they mean everything.”</p><figure id="48f86a59-1905-46e0-9806-60c30cce571e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Simone Biles accepts the best female athlete award at the Espys" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Simone Biles accepts the best female athlete award.</span> Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Biles, an 11-time Olympic medalist, also claimed the night’s first award, best championship performance for her efforts at the Paris Games.
