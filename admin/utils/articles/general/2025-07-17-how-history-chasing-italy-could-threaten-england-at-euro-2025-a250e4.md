They do it really effectively and the Norwegians just couldn't deal with how they stretch the game," former England defender Anita Asante said on BBC One.</p><p>Italy like to make the pitch as wide as possible. Against Norway their wide players hugged the touchline, meaning makeshift left-back Guro Reiten was unable to contribute to attacks. They could look to pin back England full-backs Lucy Bronze and Alex Greenwood in a similar way.</p><p>"Italy showed the fight, they showed the hunger and they showed the belief. They're also reflecting the growth of Italian women's football," said Asante.</p><p>Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha picked up on Italy's post-match celebrations.</p><p>"Italy were celebrating as if they've almost won it themselves, but that's a reminder that there are so many different perceptions as you enter the tournament and that's important because they'll be proud of that as a team and nation.</p><p>"Why can they not believe they can win one more game and play for the whole trophy?"</p><p>That said, Italy appeared to flag during the second half, and were fortunate Norway did not capitalise. England could exploit that from the bench, with Beth Mead and Aggie Beever-Jones both scoring after coming on against Wales. </p><p>"I just think we're starting to see that lethargic side from Italy, as you would expect in the fourth game of this tournament," former Scotland captain Rachel Corsie said on BBC Radio 5 Live.</p><p>"A lot of players have started all the matches. You can understand why it would take its toll."</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Girelli scores late winner for Italy against Norway</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="The-veteran-striker-midfield-creators-players-to-watch" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">The veteran striker &amp; midfield creators - players to watch</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>There's no looking past captain and linchpin Girelli, who produced two great finishes against Norway.</p><p>The first was a deft touch to guide a fizzing low cross into the far corner, the second a well-placed header that glanced in off the underside of the crossbar.</p><p>At 35 she is approaching the end of her career but her three goals in the tournament suggest she has more to offer. </p><p>"That's why she has the reputation that she does," said Corsie.
