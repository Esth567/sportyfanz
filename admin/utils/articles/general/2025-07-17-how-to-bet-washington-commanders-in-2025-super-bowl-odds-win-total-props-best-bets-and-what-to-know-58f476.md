<p>The <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/">Washington Commanders</a> in 2024 became the latest team to ride a standout rookie campaign from a quarterback picked near the top of the draft to a surprise playoff spot, with <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/">Jayden Daniels</a> quickly establishing himself as one of the league's best signal-callers. Not only did the Commanders nearly double their win total set prior to the season, but they won two road playoff games to earn a trip to the NFC Championship, where they gave up seven rushing touchdowns in a loss to the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a>.</p><p>To help bolster their defensive front after finishing 28th in yards per rush allowed, the Commanders signed four new defensive linemen in free agency, most notably <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2869019/javon-kinlaw/">Javon Kinlaw</a> to a three-year, $45 million deal, then brought in Von Miller ahead of training camp.&nbsp;But the rest of the team's key acquisitions this offseason came on the other side of the ball. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139735/deebo-samuel/">Deebo Samuel</a> comes over from San Francisco to give Daniels a legit second weapon in the passing game alongside <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139279/terry-mclaurin/">Terry McLaurin</a>. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079900/laremy-tunsil/">Laremy Tunsil</a> gives Daniels a high-level blindside protector at left tackle, and first-round pick Josh Conerly becomes the heir apparent at right tackle.</p><p>If Daniels can avoid a sophomore slump, it's hard to see the Commanders offense not being among the best in the league once again in 2025. The team's ceiling may be tied to the defense and whether it can elevate from league average into the top 10. Dan Quinn's <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a> defenses finished top seven in scoring in all three of his seasons with the team, but his stint in Atlanta only saw his defense finish higher than 14th once. Pushing beyond that level could be what this team needs to reach the <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/">Super Bowl</a>.</p><p>We're going to take a quick look at the Commanders' 2024 season and the rest of their offseason moves before getting into their track record in <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a> futures over the last five years. After that, you can find the odds available at top <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/">sportsbooks</a> for their 2025 win total along with <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/">Super Bowl</a> and playoff odds as well as key player props to know. Finally, we'll take a look at the pros and cons of betting on the Commanders in 2025 and give out our best bets.</p><h2>2024 Washington Commanders season review</h2><ul><li>Regular season: 12-5 (Second, NFC East)</li><li>Playoffs: Lost NFC Championship at Eagles 55-23</li><li>Second team ever to go from 13-loss season to 13-win season, including playoffs (1998-99 <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/">Colts</a>)</li><li>Won first playoff game since 2005 and reached first NFC Championship Game since 1991</li><li>Jayden Daniels: One of two QBs all-time with 4,000 pass yards and 1,000 rush yards in a season, including playoffs (2024 <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/">Lamar Jackson</a>)&nbsp;<br></li></ul><h2>2025 Washington Commanders offseason review</h2><table><tbody><tr><th><br></th><th>Lost</th><th>Added</th><th>Drafted</th></tr><tr><td>QB</td><td><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824745/jeff-driskel/">Jeff Driskel</a></td><td><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1325808/josh-johnson/">Josh Johnson</a></td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>RB</td><td><br></td><td><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240193/demetric-felton/">Demetric Felton</a></td><td><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126952/jacory-croskey-merritt/">Jacory Croskey-Merritt</a> (7)</td></tr><tr><td>WR</td><td><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965973/dyami-brown/">Dyami Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186266/olamide-zaccheaus/">Olamide Zaccheaus</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2184383/k-j-osborn/">K.J.

The latter has graded out positively among tackles in six of the last seven years, per PFF, while the latter is capable of adding to both the passing and rushing attacks after receiving 180 rushing attempts in his last four seasons in San Francisco.</p><p>Washington also has an easier schedule relative to the rest of the division, starting with facing the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/">Giants</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/">Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a> in the first four weeks of the season. Throw in winnable road games against the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/">Packers</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/">Chargers</a> and Cowboys, and the Commanders could march into Kansas City in Week 8 with 5-7 wins already in the bank before the schedule gets tougher down the stretch. That includes facing the Eagles twice in the last three weeks, though Week 18 could look much different depending on the postseason motivations of both teams.&nbsp;</p><h2>Reasons to fade the Commanders</h2><p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-stroud/">C.J. Stroud</a> showed last year that sophomore slumps are real for quarterbacks who impressed as rookies, and while Tunsil is the common denominator between the two situations, the rest of the Washington offensive line, just like Houston, brings questions. Each starting spot may feature an average or worse player for his position, especially with Sam Cosmi suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs last season and likely to miss a good chunk of the season. Conerly will likely take development to be a quality starter as a late first-round pick as well. Daniels had the sixth-most sacks of any quarterback last year, and a similar season could make staying healthy worth worrying about.</p><p>Javon Kinlaw, the major addition on defense, is more of a boost to the pass rush than the run defense, and it's hard to see where Washington's run defense got better after finishing 28th in yards per attempt allowed. That ranking showed that <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1631476/bobby-wagner/">Bobby Wagner</a> can't do it all himself, nor should he be expected to at age 35. After giving up 430 rushing yards in their last two playoff games, Washington has given opposing offenses a blueprint in how to not only put together scoring drives but also keep Daniels off the field as much as possible.</p><h2>How to bet the Commanders in 2025</h2><ul><li><strong>Miss playoffs +130 (DraftKings)</strong></li><li><strong>Terry McLaurin Over 980.5 receiving yards -110 (BetMGM)</strong></li></ul><p>I see the Commanders as a tough team to play or fade in the futures markets this season. Jayden Daniels has the potential to carry the team to 10 wins if the talent we saw last year was real, but he's going to see a leap in the quality of defenses he faces this year after Washington got to play a last-place schedule in 2024. Since I have them right around 9-10 wins, my best team future is going to be to miss the playoffs at the juicy +130 price at DraftKings, with the thinking that the NFC North and NFC West are so deep that some trio from a pool of the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/">Lions</a>, Packers, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/">Bears</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/">Rams</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/">49ers</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/">Cardinals</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/">Seahawks</a> could take up all the wild card spots and leave Washington needing a division title to make the postseason. If you'd prefer to make a positive play on the Commanders, I'd recommend just going for the big payout of a division winner play and hoping the Eagles' schedule is the deciding factor.</p><p>Terry McLaurin has topped 1,000 receiving yards in five straight seasons, and the only reason he didn't do so as a rookie was that he played in just 14 games, though his per-game average that year was almost identical to his career average. His role as the team's No. 1 receiver is secure, and he's playing with the best quarterback of his career. McLaurin got to 1,096 yards despite five games where he didn't post more than 22 yards, including in each of the first two weeks of the season as Daniels acclimated to the <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a>. Take out those five games, and McLaurin had at least 50 yards in the team's other 15 games (including playoffs), though his biggest spike week was still only 125 yards. All that is to say that he has the potential for higher highs this year and should sail over this number if those five duds turn into 35-50 yard outings this season. I'm not worried at all about Deebo Samuel stealing targets from McLaurin, as Washington lost 75 receptions between Dyami Brown and Olamide Zaccheaus this offseason, while Samuel has topped 60 catches just once in his career.</p>
