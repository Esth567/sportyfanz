I am not an old guy - 38 is not old. We will see."</p><p>Both fighters remained calm throughout the news conference, which began 48 minutes later than scheduled, leaving their respective teams to throw out jibes.</p><p>Usyk is yet to taste defeat in 23 fights as a professional and has won his three previous bouts in London, although none of them have taken place at Wembley Stadium.</p><p>He has fond memories of London as an amateur too, having won heavyweight gold at the 2012 Olympics.</p><p>Dubois has won three fights in a row since losing to Usyk with his most recent coming at the national stadium when he stunned Anthony Joshua in September.</p><p>"Right now I just want to get it on," Dubois said.</p><p>"I'm going to write my own script. They've got their script and I'll write my own. I'm going to win these belts and I'm going to be the man."</p><p>Dubois has picked up 21 knockouts in 22 victories with just two defeats on his record.</p><p>Lennox Lewis was the last Briton to hold undisputed status at heavyweight in 1999 but Dubois, if successful, will become the first to achieve that feat in the four-belt era.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Usyk's manager Egis Klimas suggested Dubois has not changed as a fighter in the 23 months since they last shared a ring, leading the Briton's trainer Don Charles to say he must have been asleep.</p><p>"While I was asleep, Usyk beat Tyson Fury twice," Klimas responded.</p><p>The Ukrainian made history when becoming the first four-belt heavyweight champion with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/clwwl4pq092o">victory over Fury in May 2024.</a></p><p>He backed up that win with a second triumph against the Gypsy King in December.</p><p>But some have suggested those two fights, which both went the distance, have added a lot miles on the clock for Usyk.</p><p>Usyk, dressed in a long white robe and traditional black fur hat, spent most of the news conference looking at the table, clutching rosary beads and silently mouthing prayers.</p><p>Dubois was much more understated in a tracksuit and baseball cap but also steered clear of any controversy.</p><p>Unlike April's news conference, there was no talk of the controversial low blow from the first meeting between the pair.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Double-faceoff-for-Usyk" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Double face-off for Usyk</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Despite being the away fighter, Usyk appears to have the greater support so far this week.</p><p>Usyk supporters were much louder than those of Dubois during Wednesday's open workout and it was the same at the news conference.</p><p>Dubois did his best to get his team heard when breaking gaze at the face-off and waving his arms to get them chanting his name.</p><p>After the Londoner stepped away Usyk remained in place and invited Dubois' promoter Frank Warren to a stare down on the stage.</p><p>"Daniel's coming into his prime," Warren said.</p><p>"He has had a great grounding and fought more quality fighters than most heavyweights even at the age he's at. He knows he can hurt Oleksandr because he's done it before. </p><p>"I really do believe he's going to do it against one of the great champions of heavyweight boxing."</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More boxing from the BBC</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li></ul></section></article></div>
