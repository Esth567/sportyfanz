        <p>Jelly Roll's work with WWE legend The Undertaker shows. Jelly Roll chokeslammed Logan Paul through the <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> desk while guest-hosting Wednesday's episode, a viral preview of his WWE SummerSlam tag match with Randy Orton.</p><p>Jelly Roll is currently preparing for his professional wrestling debut at next month's&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/2025-wwe-summerslam-card-date-matches-rumors-match-card-predictions-start-time-location/" target="_blank">SummerSlam</a></span>&nbsp;in New Jersey. The Grammy-nominated singer will team with legendary 14-time world champion Orton against Paul and Drew McIntyre. The two parties gave Kimmel fans a taste of the chaos to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Jelly Roll and guest Orton were recapping Saturday Night's Main Event when McIntyre interrupted their conversation. Tensions escalated to a brawl with McIntyre tackling Orton through the show's swinging doors. Jelly Roll tried to cut to commercial break, but was interrupted by Paul, a social media influencer and part-time WWE superstar. Paul handed Jelly Roll a "receipt," slapping the country singer after Jelly Roll struck Paul on Saturday. Jelly Roll, 40, responded by driving Paul through the talk show desk with a chokeslam.</p><figure>

<p>The "Son of a Sinner" singer has been diligently preparing for his wrestling debut. Earlier on Wednesday, Jelly Roll said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPTAeJB8CY" target="_blank"><em>The Pat McAfee Show</em></a>&nbsp;that he's training with former world champion Kevin Owens and former United States champion Jacob Fatu under the supervision of WWE coach Matt Bloom (formerly A-Train).</p>
        

<p>"I have been quietly living in Orlando for three or four weeks at the [WWE] Performance Center," Jelly Roll said. "I am like a piece of furniture. They cannot kick me  out of there. I am there from the moment they wake up until it closes. I  am obsessed!"</p><p>WWE Hall of Famers Undertaker and Michelle McCool sat in on one of Jelly Roll's sessions. The husband-and-wife duo asked to watch quietly, then advised him for several hours.</p>
        

<p>"They stood on the apron and gave me pointer after pointer for three hours," Jelly Roll said. "They see that I am trying to take it as seriously as I can."</p>
