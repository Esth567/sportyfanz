description: "Andy Farrell may look at ease but he knows his team need to be in physical and mental control for the first Test Sometimes the best place to gauge the mindset of a head coach before a big game is not the training pitch or the press conference room but the pub across the road. Which is where Andy Farrell and his wife, Colleen, were enjoying a relaxing post-team selection drink by an open window when a few of us happened to wander past en route back from dinner. There may be a huge contest looming but, the closer it draws, the more at ease Farrell is beginning to look. While the competitor in him loves the approaching whiff of cordite he is not a man who believes in sitting and fretting in his room before major contests.

The pair had a lengthy chat, during the course of which the conversation turned to the psychology around the thunderous State of Origin games of a quarter of a century ago.</p><p>The Queensland sides of that era were often viewed by outsiders as underdogs but within their own dressing room it was very different. Tallis told Farrell the Maroons never saw themselves in that light, offering a timely reminder that this Lions series could still unfold differently to how many people expect. “Australia will be [thinking] exactly the same,” cautioned Farrell, having finally confirmed his first Test lineup. “It’s the same as us being favourites. It’s about your preparation and how you get down to performing and that’s all that matters.”</p><p>Farrell, in short, has been around enough Australian opposition to remain on red alert despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/17/wallabies-call-on-champion-de-crespigny-for-surprise-debut-in-lions-opener" data-link-name="in body link">a Wallaby team sheet</a> which, at first glance, contains more holes than a battered old colander. No Rob Valetini; no Will Skelton; no Langi Gleeson; a fly-half making his first Test start in the shape of Tom Lynagh and an uncapped flanker, the magnificently named Nick Champion de Crespigny, whose family originate from Normandy and whose grandfather is a renowned Asian historian. If they intend to rival the legendary Wallaby sides of yesteryear, not least those that featured Lynagh’s father, Michael, this depleted mob still have some way to travel.</p><figure id="5e46aa5f-6673-4968-8226-df95a9242616" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Australia’s Nick Champion de Crespigny catches a ball" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.6026747195858" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Australia’s Nick Champion de Crespigny catches a ball during a training session ahead of the first Test against the British and Irish Lions.</span> Photograph: Jono Searle/AP</figcaption></figure><p>That said, De Crespigny is one to keep an eye on – “He’s a psycho, he loves contact,” revealed his teammate Fraser McReight approvingly – and the Wallabies still possess a decent lineout and a gritty front five. Where the Lions will be hoping to gain an edge, however, is in collective muscle and intent. Farrell looks likely to tailor his selections to fit the circumstances in this series but, first up, it would seem he wants to give his hosts a proper full-frontal physical examination.</p><p>Hence the selection of no-nonsense forwards such as Ellis Genge and Joe McCarthy and, notably, Tom Curry who has narrowly won the nod to start ahead of Jac Morgan and Josh van der Flier. With Dan Sheehan and Jack Conan riding shotgun, the Wallaby defence will be fully occupied even before Jamison Gibson-Park and Finn Russell start pulling the strings.</p><figure id="838aeaf0-088e-4f25-a850-81dd05b5b6b3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555818028925d4041d1ab31b0f9d856e37269743/0_0_3682_2631/master/3682.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555818028925d4041d1ab31b0f9d856e37269743/0_0_3682_2631/master/3682.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555818028925d4041d1ab31b0f9d856e37269743/0_0_3682_2631/master/3682.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555818028925d4041d1ab31b0f9d856e37269743/0_0_3682_2631/master/3682.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555818028925d4041d1ab31b0f9d856e37269743/0_0_3682_2631/master/3682.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555818028925d4041d1ab31b0f9d856e37269743/0_0_3682_2631/master/3682.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Tom Curry " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555818028925d4041d1ab31b0f9d856e37269743/0_0_3682_2631/master/3682.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="317.97800108636613" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Curry at a British &amp; Irish Lions training session.</span> Photograph: Billy Stickland/INPHO/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>Then there is the big game experience of Tadhg Beirne which, as much as anything else, has earned him the blindside berth ahead of Ollie Chessum. Beirne, as well as providing an extra lineout presence, has the ability to snaffle a turnover or two. The Wallabies have some talented athletes but first of all they have to win the ball.</p><p>And if that proves a struggle and their foundations start to wobble, the Lions fancy they have enough on the bench to capitalise.
