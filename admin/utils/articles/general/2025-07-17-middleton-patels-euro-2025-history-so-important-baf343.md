What we found out was there's plenty of participation at grassroots level.</p><p>"Where the numbers fall away is from there (grassroots) to academies. So then we got a real idea of what we needed to do.</p><p>"The old phrase, 'you can't be it if you can't see it', I never really believed in it much when I was young. But since I've got older and have seen what this has done especially, it does play a big part, and I think there is going to be a shift. </p><p>"For our country, the numbers are growing, and they will continue to grow now."</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Man Utd's Middleton-Patel discusses her Autism diagnosis</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="A-catalyst-for-change" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">A catalyst for change?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Former Brentford player Riz Rehman runs AIMS as part of his role as player inclusion executive at the PFA.</p><p>And Rehman believes Middleton-Patel's debut at the Euros - her fifth cap overall for her country - has the potential to positively influence the future generation who may have previously felt their route into the game was blocked.</p><p>"Visibility is incredibly impactful, especially on a major international stage like the Euros," he told BBC Sport Wales.</p><p>"Representation at the top level plays a huge role in shifting perceptions and positively impacting how people feel about a sport which they may not have previously thought was 'for them'. </p><p>"In that sense, what Safia has done this summer is so important, and it's right that it's celebrated."</p><p>While Middleton-Patel's showing on the big stage represents a landmark moment in numerous ways, Vyas says it must become "a turning point" for future players.</p><p>"As powerful as that visibility is, it can't do all the work on its own," she explained.</p><p>"Safia shouldn't have to carry the weight of change just by existing in that space. If we want to see more players from South Asian backgrounds breaking through, we need to meet this moment with real, practical action - not just celebration.</p><p>"That means challenging outdated assumptions in talent ID, properly supporting girls at grassroots level, and making sure football environments actually feel safe and inclusive - for them and for their families. </p><p>"This can't just be a milestone - it needs to be a turning point."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="A-role-model-for-many-reasons" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">A role model for many reasons</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>"Saf is such an incredible role model and speaks out about so much brilliant stuff when it comes to neurodiversity," added journalist Walker-Khan.
