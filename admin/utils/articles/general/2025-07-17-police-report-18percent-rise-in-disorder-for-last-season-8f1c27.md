Of these, 199 were related to men's game and 13 to women's. </p><p>Policing minister Diana Johnson said: "Police up and down the country work incredibly hard to ensure football stadiums are safe, so we can all enjoy our national game.</p><p>"Today's statistics show that these efforts are paying off and strong action is being taken to stop violence and disorder from ruining football."</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p></section></article></main></div></div>
