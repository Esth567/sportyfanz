Here's how things stand in my power rankings:</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/pll/500/122896.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="90"></p><h2>1. Denver Outlaws</h2><p><strong>Current record:</strong> 4-2<br>
<strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 1</p><p>A 13-6 win over Maryland in Week 7 was never in doubt. The Tewaaraton quartet (Brennan O'Neil, Pat Kavanagh, Logan Wisnauskas and Jared Bernhardt) are building chemistry. Goalie Logan McNaney made 15 saves and is now 4-0 as the starter -- and the rookie of the year favorite. The Outlaws went for a dip in Lake Michigan after the win on Saturday night.</p><p><strong>This week:</strong> vs. Cannons | Saturday, 3 p.m. ET | ABC/ESPN+</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/pll/500/127632.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="90"></p><h2>2. New York Atlas</h2><p><strong>Current record:</strong> 4-2<br>
<strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 2</p><p>New York rocked Boston, jumping out to a 4-0 lead which ballooned to 11-3 at halftime. Connor Shellenberger scored five times and added two assists, emerging as an MVP candidate. Reigning MVP Jeff Teat had four assists. This lineup is rock solid with FOGO Trevor Baptiste, goalie Liam Entenmann and short stick defensive midfielder Danny Logan. My simulation models have New York finishing 7-3.</p><p><strong>This week:</strong> vs. Redwoods | Friday, 6:30 p.m. ET | ESPN+</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45720295" data-cerebro-id="6871b72af9cb241c51c482d1" data-title="Shellenberger's big night lifts Atlas over Cannons" data-source="espn" data-contributing-partner="wsc"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0712%2Fc218cb00%2D0207%2D4724%2Db685%2Db7291c05ba95%2Fc218cb00%2D0207%2D4724%2Db685%2Db7291c05ba95.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0712%2Fc218cb00%2D0207%2D4724%2Db685%2Db7291c05ba95%2Fc218cb00%2D0207%2D4724%2Db685%2Db7291c05ba95.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0712%2Fc218cb00%2D0207%2D4724%2Db685%2Db7291c05ba95%2Fc218cb00%2D0207%2D4724%2Db685%2Db7291c05ba95.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45720295">play</span><figcaption><p>1:58</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Shellenberger's big night lifts Atlas over Cannons</p><p>Connor Shellenberger scores five goals as New York beats Boston 17-11.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/pll/500/127637.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="90"></p><h2>3. Philadelphia Waterdogs</h2><p><strong>Current record:</strong> 4-2<br>
<strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 3</p><p>No. 1 overall pick CJ Kirst was activated off the PUP list this week and could make his pro debut in Fairfield. In Week 7, MVP frontrunner Michael Sowers &amp; Co. dominated Utah, building an 11-4 halftime lead and hanging on for a 16-11 victory. What was most impressive to me was the depth of contribution on offense; Connor Kelly, Kieran McArdle, Jake Taylor, Jack Hannah, Zach Currier and others all ate family style in this tour de force.</p><p><strong>This week:</strong> vs. Whipsnakes | Saturday, 8 p.m. ET | ESPN+</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/pll/500/122997.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="90"></p><h2>4. Boston Cannons</h2><p><strong>Current record:</strong> 3-3<br>
<strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 4</p><p>Awful pick defense and switching matchups proved costly in a one-sided loss to eastern rival New York. The Cannons looked lost, reeling in all departments after consecutive setbacks to the Redwoods and Atlas. I would anticipate lineup and schematic adjustments from coach Brian Holman. Matt Campbell and Ryan Drenner have been two consistent offensive weapons. Another loss this weekend could put them into a deep hole.</p><p><strong>This week:</strong> vs. Outlaws | Saturday, 3 p.m. ET | ABC/ESPN+</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/pll/500/127631.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="90"></p><h2>5. Utah Archers</h2><p><strong>Current record:</strong> 2-4<br>
<strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 5</p><p>Another massive scoreless streak (16:54) was too much to overcome in a loss to Philadelphia on Lake Michigan. Faceoff wins, like Ferris Bueller, took the day off. The return of Tre Leclaire (two goals) was a positive for the offense, and that unit did show some life in the second half. I'm still looking for more production from Grant Ament, Connor Fields and complementary midfielders.</p><p><strong>This week:</strong> vs. Chaos | Friday, 9 p.m. ET | ESPN2/ESPN+</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/pll/500/127638.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="90"></p><h2>6. Maryland Whipsnakes</h2><p><strong>Current record:</strong> 2-4<br>
<strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 6</p><p>Inept offense -- the Whips had a franchise-low six goals -- resulted in a sobering 13-6 Saturday night loss to Denver. Lack of creativity in offensive flow, devoid of a pick game to change matchups, and the inability to penetrate were widespread. Goalie Emmet Carroll was a bright spot with 16 saves, as was FOGO Joe Nardella.</p><p><strong>This week:</strong> vs. Waterdogs | Saturday, 8 p.m. ET | ESPN+</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/pll/500/127634.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="90"></p><h2>7. Carolina Chaos</h2><p><strong>Current record:</strong> 3-3<br>
<strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 7</p><p>The Chaos have won two straight after defeating Boston and California. Saturday's 12-10 comeback win over the Woods elevates Carolina into the playoff discussion with four weeks left. Ross Scott chipped in three second-half goals, and lefty Owen Hiltz was clutch. They used a 5-1 late run to keep California in the Western Conference basement. Gritty defense led by Jack Rowlett, Jared Neumann, Troy Reh and goalie Blaze Riorden is the franchise foundation.</p><p><strong>This week:</strong> vs. Archers | Friday, 9 p.m. ET | ESPN2/ESPN+</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45727059" data-cerebro-id="687306a9f9cb241c51c4d41e" data-title="Ross Scott rips in a goal" data-source="espn" data-contributing-partner="wsc"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0713%2Fc09a0450%2D62a2%2D4be4%2D9dbb%2D71b9fa22c333%2Fc09a0450%2D62a2%2D4be4%2D9dbb%2D71b9fa22c333.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0713%2Fc09a0450%2D62a2%2D4be4%2D9dbb%2D71b9fa22c333%2Fc09a0450%2D62a2%2D4be4%2D9dbb%2D71b9fa22c333.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0713%2Fc09a0450%2D62a2%2D4be4%2D9dbb%2D71b9fa22c333%2Fc09a0450%2D62a2%2D4be4%2D9dbb%2D71b9fa22c333.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45727059">play</span><figcaption><p>0:39</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Ross Scott rips in a goal</p><p>Ross Scott scores a nice goal for the Chaos.</p></div></div><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/pll/500/127636.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110" width="90"></p><h2>8. California Redwoods</h2><p><strong>Current record:</strong> 2-4<br>
<strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 8</p><p>Offensive struggles in the second half, as well as a low shooting percentage overall, added up to a fourth consecutive loss. The Woods had no answers for Carolina's slow-to-slide man-to-man defensive scheme, and couldn't solve Blaze Riorden either. Cali has hit on five two-point goals in their last two games, but the settled half-field sets are otherwise stagnant. Outside of rookie Andrew McAdorey the midfield group have not been efficient passers. The Woods will be underdogs against New York on Friday night.</p><p><strong>This week:</strong> vs. Atlas | Friday, 6:30 p.m. ET | ESPN+</p>
