Personally, I am struggling to express the sadness I feel but I am deeply grateful for every moment we shared with him and for the joy he brought to our team every single day. </p><p>"He loved the bike, he loved the camera, he loved to smile, he loved to laugh, but most of all he loved his family and his team-mates."</p><p>The Giro della Valle d'Aosta is a men's under-23 held in the Aosta Valley.</p><p>Thursday's second stage in Passy was cancelled and the race will resume on Friday with the third stage preceded by a moment of remembrance. The initial section of the stage will be neutralised in memory of Privitera.</p><p>FCI president Cordiano Dagnoni added: "This news leaves us shocked and forces us to think even more decisively about how to make our races safer."</p></div></article></main></div></div>
