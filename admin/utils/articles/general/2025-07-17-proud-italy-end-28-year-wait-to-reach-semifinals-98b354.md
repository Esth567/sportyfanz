"But history is written by what has been done before, so we must give credit to those who were there in previous years, who, even without these possibilities, have given a boost to the movement. We are reaping the fruits.</p><p>"The girls deserve a lot of credit because they have done something exceptional; it is beautiful to discover now that we have entered history, now let's enjoy it fully and in a few minutes we will start thinking about the semifinals."</p><p><strong>- Lindop: <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45756621/girelli-shows-norway-how-clinical-italy-reach-euro-2025-semifinal">Girelli shows Norway how to be clinical</a></strong><br>

And Soncin and his team made the most of the moment. The 46-year-old coach clasped two players' hands and the team did a celebratory run hand-in-hand toward the Italian fans at Stade de Geneve after the final whistle.</p><p>"Let's really enjoy this moment. That's what I asked the girls before the match: to enjoy the moment, this incredible atmosphere," he said. "Today was truly electrifying, from the anthem to the celebrations, with all the people. Something unique."</p><p>Norway defended poorly for Girelli's second goal which proved lethal considering the <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=20092">Juventus</a> striker scored the most headed goals in Europe's big five leagues this past season.</p><p>"This is not just a victory for us, but it truly belongs to everyone, to all of Italian women's football," the 35-year-old Girelli told RAI.</p><p>"But truly, this is a victory for the whole group, for 23 girls, but more so for all those who are at home watching the victory of the entire Italian women's movement.</p><p>"This is really something incredible for the new generation; being among the top four in Europe is a dream come true."</p><p>Girelli now has 61 goals for Italy and the last three all went into the same net at the mountains end of the Stade de Gen√®ve stadium.</p><p>She also scored one of the goals of the tournament, curling in a 22-meter shot against Portugal.</p><p>"We felt at home here," Girelli said of the Swiss city with a big Italian community where the Azzurre will play a third game next week. "Maybe I could ask Juventus to play in this stadium, I'm joking."</p><p>Girelli heaped praise on Soncin, who was hired by Italy in late 2023.</p><p>"He has an extremely important human value and it is something we have perceived since the first days he arrived," she told RAI.</p><p>"He has adapted in a really special way, with a humility that is hard to find in an environment he was not familiar with.</p><p>"During training, just looking into his eyes tells us a lot of things. A single glance is enough for us to understand if we are on the right track. There is always a positive energy from him and it boosts our confidence."</p><p>Italy will face the winner of Thursday's quarterfinal between <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=5159">England</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2764">Sweden</a> in the semis.</p><p><em>Information from Reuters, The Associated Press and ESPN Research was used in this report.</em></p>
