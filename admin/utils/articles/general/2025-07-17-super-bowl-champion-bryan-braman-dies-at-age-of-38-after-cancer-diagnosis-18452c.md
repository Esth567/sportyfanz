He is survived by his two daughters, Blakely and Marlowe, aged 11 and eight. <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/surround-yourself-with-the-right-people-words-of-wisdom-with-super-bowl-winner-bryan-braman-of-df5fbc87389a" data-link-name="in body link">He once described</a> his seven NFL seasons, his Super Bowl win and his daughters as “the three greatest accomplishments in my life”.</p><p>According to a GoFundMe page set up to help Braman with his medical expenses, he was diagnosed with cancer in February. The page had raised $88,000 and many of his former teammates had given donations, including JJ Watt, who contributed $10,000. Qualified <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">NFL</a> players are eligible for health insurance for five years after they retire. Braman’s final season came in 2017, with the Super Bowl his last ever professional game.</p><p>Braman joined the Texans in 2011 as an undrafted free agent after stints with Long Beach City College, Idaho and West Texas A&amp;M in college. He soon established himself on special teams thanks to his fearless play – he once made a tackle despite losing his helmet – and was known for his punt blocking ability. One such highlight came with the Eagles, whom he joined in 2014, during their Super Bowl run when he blocked a punt by the Atlanta Falcons in a tight 15-10 win in the divisional round.</p><p>He recorded one tackle in the Super Bowl itself as the Eagles beat the New England Patriots 41-33 to win their first NFL championship since the 1960 season.</p></div></div>
