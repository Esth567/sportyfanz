But fear? No. We don't have the word fear in our dictionary," said Asllani.</p><p>"We look up the word courage. Of course you have to respect one of the best sides in the world but we have the perfect gameplan for this match. </p><p>"We want to achieve the football we want to represent. In our minds there is only one outcome and that is to win the game." </p><p>Sweden have been one of the standout performers in the tournament and England <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly8p4vkr30o">captain Leah Williamson said</a> they "deserved a little bit more recognition".</p><p>Alongside England and France, Sweden have reached the quarter-finals at all five major tournaments since 2017.</p><p>"I feel like Sweden are always flying under the radar. It kind of suits us," said London City Lionesses midfielder Asllani. </p><p>"Obviously we think we're one of the best teams in the world from what we have been doing. But people rarely speak about us as [a team] who can win gold. </p><p>"We know we can beat any team in the world when we have our best day. People should definitely talk about us more."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="James-is-also-a-special-player" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'James is also a special player'</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>England beat Sweden 4-0 in the Euro 2022 semi-finals, but the teams drew twice in the Euro 2025 qualifiers last year.</p><p>Sweden manager Gerhardsson is aware of England's threats and said he was happy he personally did not have to play against Chelsea forward Lauren James.</p><p>The 23-year-old has scored two goals in three games and was a handful against the Netherlands and Wales.</p><p>"She is one of these players - we trained for Pernille Harder for Denmark, Ewa Pajor for Poland is a special one, Lea Schuller for Germany is a special one - James is also a special player," said Gerhardsson. </p><p>"I like that kind of player because she has something special, movement and things like that, but she's doing the things she thinks are right on the pitch. </p><p>"As a coach sometimes, you want structure - 'do that, do that'. But James, even if she listens to the coach, she makes her own decisions.</p><p>"Every coach likes that kind of player.

She is one of my best friends there. The thing with Johanna is probably her mindset," said England defender Lucy Bronze. </p><p>"She is very competitive. I've seen that this season at Chelsea. She will run through a brick wall for her team. How to stop her? Hopefully she's on the other side to me."</p><p>Bronze is usually an attacking full-back for England but she could have her hands full against former Barcelona team-mate Fridolina Rolfo on Thursday night. </p><p>Asked if she will have to adapt the way she plays, Bronze said: "I do whatever [manager Sarina Wiegman] tells me. I am in the positions that benefit the team.</p><p>"Yeah, I like to attack, but I also like to defend. We know the threat Sweden has in a lot of those wide positions, but at the same time we're a good team. </p><p>"We don't want to change too much because we want to focus on our strengths and what we can bring to the game."</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
