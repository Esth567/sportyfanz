Mickelson distilled at the par-three 3rd!</strong> His tee shot plugs under the lip of a pot bunker. It’s almost impossible to escape. He opens the face of his wedge and lashes hard … but even this genius can’t get the ball out. It slams into the face and rolls back into the middle of the trap. But take two is something else. He swishes smoothly, sending his ball high, landing it 15 feet to the right of the pin, and using a combination of camber and spin to roll serenely into the cup! Par. You knew that was going in once it took it’s left-turn screech and rolled out. He raises both arms in the air as the crowd go wild. He remains at -1. That’s one of the shots of the week <em>already</em>. Disaster averted in sensational style, and with such skill and panache. Mickelson in microcosm.

He finds the first ball within the allowed three-minute search, though he’s still got to take an unplayable, dropping in the native area. He can’t reach the green with his next shot, and isn’t able to get close with his chip up. He gives his 30-foot bogey putt a good go, but that’s a double. It could have been a lot worse, because for a brief moment back there, he could have been trudging back to the tee to hit his fifth. In fact that’s quite a result, all told.

While Cameron Smith, Rory McIlroy and Cameron Young were duking it out for the big prize on the Sunday at St Andrews in 2022, hogging the limelight, Kaewkanjana was busy carding a final round of 65 en route to an 11th-place finish. He’s in form on the Asian Tour, tying for second at the Philippine Open and winning the Kolon Korea, and that’s translating well to Portrush, where he’s birdied 2 and then eagled the short par-four 5th. He’s now -3 through 6, just the one shot off the lead.</p></article><article id="block-6878e60d8f088603e1f62646"><header><h2>Li shoots 67</h2></header><p><strong>Thanks David, enjoy your cup of Nambarrie.

I was decently comfortable when I got on the tee. Obviously didn’t try for too much, hit a nice smooth 3-iron down there, held the pose a little bit.</p>
 <p>I got a little emotional when I was clapped on, and then I calmed down, and I was kind of fine when I was hitting it. Obviously after that, I don’t know through the start maybe there was a little bit of hype in it, the three-putting 3 and 4, I just struggled. Three three-putts in the first seven holes, it just kills you when you’re always thinking about your pace as you’re standing over the ball, you’re always questioning your lines.</p>
 <p>Yeah, it was a tough day on the greens, and it just ate into my game. Might have been a little bit of the fact that I was hyped up for the 1st tee box. Who knows? Certainly felt like I played better, could have played better, should have played better, scored better.</p>
 <p>I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with my putting, and I had a horrible day on the greens. It’s one of those things that’s the nature of the game, links golf. I’d love to be -- yeah, I’d love to be a bit better, but it wasn’t for a lack of trying.</p>

I’ve had a few pennies on local man Tom McKibbin this week and followed him for the first six holes in an entertaining three-ball also featuring Padraig Harrington and Nicolai Hojgaard. McKibbin struggled early and had to sink a testy par putt to avoid dropping to +3. But he made that putt at 4, birdied 5 and, as I walked back to the media centre, McKibbin’s name magically appeared at the top of the leaderboard. Clearly freed up by the aversion of my penetrating gaze, he’d eagled the par-5 7th. He added another at 9 to go to -2 but, just as I sat down in the press canteen for a full English (£11 if you’re interested; we get a £30 food card so that’s a third of the budget gone), I watched him on one of the TVs in there hacking around in rough at 11. He racked up a double bogey, as did Hojgaard. Both bounced back with birdie at 12 to get into red figures again and Hojaard as added another at 13 to make it bunched a the top.</p></article><article id="block-6878bb558f081f68b78416d4"><header></header><p><strong>Thanks Scott.</strong> Ludicrous claim but thankyou. You join me as defending champion, Xander Schauffele, launches his opening tee-shot. And it’s a good ‘un from the hero of Troon 12 months ago. On the short grass. A nerve settler. New US Open champion J.J. Spaun and Jon Rahm make up a high-quality three-ball. Rahm once won the Irish Open down the road at Portstewart and he was 11th in the 2019 Open here so he likes this stretch of the Northern Irish coast.</p></article><article id="block-6878baed8f088603e1f623a4"><header></header><p><strong>… and with that, I’m going to hand over to THE MOST HANDSOME MAN IN WEST YORKSHIRE (population 2.3 million), David Tindall.</strong> See you again in a while.</p></article><article id="block-6878b9488f081f68b78416be"><header></header><p><strong>Haotong Li shot 63 on the final day at Birkdale as a 21-year-old in 2017.</strong> He’s not done too much in the majors since that third-placed finish behind Jordan Spieth and Matt Kuchar, and his career hasn’t quite hit the heights some predicted at that time. Although four wins on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/european-tour" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">European Tour</a> isn’t exactly shabby. But perhaps he’s ready to hit the heights again, and with birdies at 5 and 7, the 29-year-old from China joins the leaders at -2. He’s certainly got the confidence to launch another bid for the title: he carries a wedge on which the following is engraved: HAOTONG IS THE MOST HANDSOME MAN IN CHINA. There are 1.4 billion people in China.</p></article><article id="block-6878b8088f08eca8105b36ae"><header></header><p><strong>Double bogeys for Tom McKibbin and Nicolai Højgaard at 11.</strong> Højgaard will possibly be the happier – or rather, the less consumed by fume – of the two, given he parred with his second ball to limit the damage. McKibbin, having found his, decelerated when chipping out from the thick stuff, and while it’s not the most egregious of errors, on account of the filthy tangled lie, he might feel he’s looked a gift horse in the mouth having found his ball. But both slip from -2 back to level par. Which means – thanks to Lee Westwood making birdie at 5 – there’s a vintage look to the top of the leaderboard. Who’d have bet on this?!</p><p><em>-2: Mickelson (8), Westwood (6)<br>

Ryan Peake has had a troubled history, to say the very least. Here’s how he’s rebuilt his life after time in the jug. He’s making his Open debut this week, and given the benefit of experience and perspective, bogeys at 1, 2 and 5 this morning are unlikely to faze him too much. He’s currently +2.</p><figure id="1adc3f8d-5f99-4720-8e74-224de7e04860" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:1,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘It will never happen again’: former bikie-turned-golf pro Ryan Peake bears the scars of a chequered past&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;1adc3f8d-5f99-4720-8e74-224de7e04860&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;inline&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/02/ryan-peake-ex-rebels-bikie-pro-golf-new-zealand-open&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:11,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}"></gu-island></figure></article><article id="block-6878b5d98f088603e1f6236c"><header></header><p><strong>Tom McKibbin has found his ball.</strong> It’s not exactly in the ideal spot, though, and he can’t hack it back onto the fairway at the first attempt.
