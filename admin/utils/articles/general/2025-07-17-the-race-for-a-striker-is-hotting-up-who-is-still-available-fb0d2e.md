He is also one of a number of strikers Liverpool are looking at, with the Reds now hoping to complete a deal by the weekend.</p><p>Chelsea were another club seriously interested in him but, having recently signed Delap and Joao Pedro, they are unlikely to move for another frontman, unless there is movement out.</p><p>Ekitike has enjoyed the best goalscoring season of his career, scoring 15 goals and adding eight assists for Frankfurt to help them finish third in the Bundesliga and earn a Champions League place.</p><p><b>Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)</b></p><p>Manchester United's move for the Brentford forward has gone a bit quiet in recent weeks.</p><p>But those at Old Trafford hope Mbeumo's protracted move for more than £60m is completed before Ruben Amorim and his squad set off on their pre-season travels at the weekend. </p><p>Tottenham are also interested in the 25-year-old Cameroon international but are yet to make a bid, while there are several Champions League clubs on the continent watching his situation closely.</p><p><b>Yoane Wissa (Brentford)</b></p><p>Tottenham are also exploring a move for another Brentford forward.</p><p>BBC Sport understands the Bees have been made aware of their London rivals' interest in the 28-year-old, in a deal that could reunite the forward with his former manager Thomas Frank, now in charge at Spurs.</p><p>Wissa, who scored 20 goals last season, courted major interest from Premier League clubs in recent months, Nottingham Forest failing to sign the DR Congo international in January.</p><p>Liverpool are another club monitoring Wissa's situation, but have other preferred targets to explore first, while Newcastle also have an interest and could move on to him if Ekitike joins Liverpool.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Ones-to-watch" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Ones to watch</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)</b></p><p>The Slovenian 22-year-old looked as though he could have been heading to Arsenal this summer but, with Gyokeres now the Gunners' priority, that move is off the table.</p><p>He has also been linked with the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool.</p><p>If they sign Mbeumo, Manchester United would need to sell to fund a potential move for a striker.</p><p>Sesko signed a five-year contract this time last season and it has been reported Leipzig would want up to £85m for him. Don't rule out a move from one of Europe's top clubs later in the window.</p><p><b>Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)</b></p><p>Arsenal made a late bid for England striker Ollie Watkins in the final few days of the winter transfer window, with Aston Villa refusing the reported £40m offer.</p><p>A striker a number of clubs are understood to be keeping an eye on, with both Liverpool and Manchester United known to be admirers.</p><p>Villa would not be keen to sell the 29-year-old, but could a late substantial bid twist their arm?</p><p><b>Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)</b></p><p>Another striker who has been linked with a move away this summer, but Crystal Palace are determined to keep hold of him.</p><p>Numerous clubs have shown an interest in the Frenchman but the Eagles are hoping he will sign a new long-term deal, with his current contract expiring in 2027.</p><p>The 28-year-old was a standout performer in Oliver Glasner's side last season, scoring 17 goals in all competitions as Palace won the FA Cup - their first major trophy.</p><p><b>Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)</b></p><p>Jackson was Chelsea's first-choice striker last season but the arrival of Joao Pedro and Delap does raise a few questions.</p><p>The 24-year-old Senegal international scored 10 Premier League goals in 2024-25 and would likely have significant interest from elsewhere if he was made available.</p><p><b>Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)</b></p><p>A free agent after his Everton deal expired this summer.</p><p>Newcastle and Manchester United have been linked with the 28-year-old England forward.</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li></ul></section></article></div>
