        <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1620879/von-miller/">Von Miller</a> plans to sign with the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/">Washington Commanders</a>, the star pass rusher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/vonmiller/p/DMMO1zaMqYP/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announced on social media Wednesday.</a>&nbsp;It's a one-year deal for Miller, according to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones.&nbsp;</p><p>Miller will play his 16th <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a> season with Washington as he eyes the third <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/">Super Bowl</a> title of his career. Washington was one win away from a Super Bowl appearance last season but lost to the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/">Philadelphia Eagles</a> in the NFC Championship Game.</p><p>Miller, 36, spent the last three seasons with the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/">Buffalo Bills</a> but was released in March in a cost-cutting move that saved Buffalo more than $8 million in cap space. He recorded 17 tackles and six sacks during a 2024 campaign that included Miller <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bills-von-miller-suspended-four-games-for-violating-nfls-conduct-policy-stemming-from-assault-allegations/" target="_blank">serving a four-game suspension</a></span> for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy stemming from assault allegations. Miller signed a six-year, $120 million deal with the Bills during the 2022 offseason.</p><p>Despite not getting signed when free agency opened, Miller made it clear in May that he wanted to play at least one more season in the league.</p>
        

<p>"I got this year on the books for sure, I'm going to play this coming up season, just got to find a team to play on," Miller <a href="https://x.com/MaseDenver/status/1927952025054007461" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said May 29</a>. "We'll just keep doing it one year at a time. If I had another great year this year, then I'll play the next year after that, but we'll just keep doing it one year at a time."</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-breaking-down-exactly-why-bengals-shemar-stewart-remains-only-unsigned-2025-first-round-pick/" target="_blank">

<p>Miller is one of the most accomplished edge rushers of his era. The No. 2 overall pick in the 2011 <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/">NFL Draft</a> by the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/">Denver Broncos</a>, Miller has totaled 129.5 sacks (16th all-time), earned eight Pro Bowl nods and been named a first-team All-Pro three times during his illustrious career. He was named MVP of Super Bowl 50 with the Broncos and won Super Bowl LVI with the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/">Los Angeles Rams</a>.</p><p>The Commanders are coming off an excellent 2024 season. Led by rookie quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/">Jayden Daniels</a>, they went 12-5 during the regular season and won a playoff game for the first time since 2005.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>Can Miller provide pass rush help? <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2173899/dante-fowler/">Dante Fowler</a> was the only Commanders player to top 10 sacks last season, but he has since signed with the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/">Dallas Cowboys</a>. Washington did, however, sign Deatrich Wise, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2869019/javon-kinlaw/">Javon Kinlaw</a> and Jacob Martin as free agents to bolster the defensive line. Miller will now join that group.&nbsp;</p>
