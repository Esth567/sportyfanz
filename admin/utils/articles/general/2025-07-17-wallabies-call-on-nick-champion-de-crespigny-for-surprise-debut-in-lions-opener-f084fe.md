The Lynaghs are now set to become the first Australian father and son to play Test rugby against the Lions.</p><p>The absence of Valetini’s ball-carrying is a sizeable blow but Schmidt says others are capable of filling the void.</p><p>“We try not to base our whole game around any individual,” Schmidt said. “I’d like to think that we can still go out with quiet confidence that we can put a game together that can at least keep the British and Irish Lions pretty honest on the day.”</p><p>Valetini and Skelton both suffered calf strains in training for Australia’s warm-up Test against Fiji while Gleeson has a bruised thigh. It has opened the door for Champion de Crespigny, 29, who only returned to Super Rugby this season following a stint playing for Castres in the French Top 14.</p><p>Hooker Matt Faessler also returns following a hamstring injury but Schmidt acknowledges the Lions present “a massive challenge” to the home side.</p><p>“With the short runway leading up to such a big Test match, we know we must adapt fast and improve quickly, from the performance we had against Fiji recently,” Schmidt said. “We’re very much aware of the occasion and conscious of earning the support from the public through the effort they see on the field.”</p><figure id="e5c6d6ed-3819-4f6c-b532-9928d62f7ce9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30aedcf6b3462d453e1eaba0354f9b3f107291d/0_0_2293_1529/master/2293.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30aedcf6b3462d453e1eaba0354f9b3f107291d/0_0_2293_1529/master/2293.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30aedcf6b3462d453e1eaba0354f9b3f107291d/0_0_2293_1529/master/2293.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30aedcf6b3462d453e1eaba0354f9b3f107291d/0_0_2293_1529/master/2293.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30aedcf6b3462d453e1eaba0354f9b3f107291d/0_0_2293_1529/master/2293.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30aedcf6b3462d453e1eaba0354f9b3f107291d/0_0_2293_1529/master/2293.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Tom Lynagh during an Australia Wallabies training session" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30aedcf6b3462d453e1eaba0354f9b3f107291d/0_0_2293_1529/master/2293.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.731356301788" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Lynagh will follow in his father’s footsteps against the Lions.</span> Photograph: Chris Hyde/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>There is no shortage of responsibility, consequently, on Lynagh’s young shoulders. “I’m really excited for Tom,” Schmidt said. “He’s a great kid.

We twice had him lined up for his first start for the Wallabies last year and he picked up little niggles. It’s probably not ideal to be starting your first Test match for the Wallabies against the British &amp; Irish Lions but you’ve got to start somewhere. And if not now, when? So now is good. I’m confident in him and it’s a stadium he knows really well. If he can settle early, hopefully he can get a rhythm that allows him to dictate the game to a degree.</p><p>“Whatever does get thrown at Tom, I am confident that he’ll cope and I’m very confident he’ll learn from the occasion. It may be that he has to learn quickly because of the magnitude of the game and the quality of the opposition.”</p></div></div>
