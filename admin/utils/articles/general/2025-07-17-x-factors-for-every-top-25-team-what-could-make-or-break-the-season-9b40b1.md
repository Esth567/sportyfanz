If this one thing comes together as planned -- or even better than expected -- the season could be a big success. If it doesn't go well, the team's season could go south.</p><p>Though the quarterback position often fills that role, especially when there's a new player at the helm, other concerns can be shoring up a weakness from last year, incorporating a key transfer or having an important player return from injury.</p><p>For the teams in our <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45025016/way-too-early-college-football-post-spring-top-25-ranking-2025">post-spring Power Rankings</a>, the stakes are particularly high. Spots in the College Football Playoff are on the line, and failure could put coaches on the hot seat.</p><p>We asked our college football reporters to provide the biggest X factor -- the one thing that could make or break the season -- for each of our Top 25 teams.</p><p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png" width="100%"></p><h2><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/213.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"> 1. <a data-clubhouse-guid="899b6845-67a4-16b2-c4a6-2406312be7fc" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/213/penn-state-nittany-lions">Penn State Nittany Lions</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> QB <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4714771/drew-allar">Drew Allar</a>'s big-game performances</p><p>Penn State enters what appears to be an all-in season, and Allar has the ingredients to be the top NFL quarterback prospect for the 2026 draft. But his play under the brightest of lights has left something to be desired. He hasn't beaten Ohio State or Michigan, he delivered some good moments in a Big Ten championship game loss to Oregon but was still intercepted twice, and threw the crucial interception in a CFP semifinal loss to Notre Dame. Penn State has made the necessary investments around Allar, who will share a backfield with probably the nation's top running back tandem. The time has come for the senior to be at his best in the biggest moments. If he delivers, Penn State will have a real chance at its first national title since 1986. -- <em>Adam Rittenberg</em></p><hr><h2><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/228.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"> 2. <a data-clubhouse-guid="02382072-a5a3-24ff-6bd1-422a029bd33c" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/228/clemson-tigers">Clemson Tigers</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> Run defense</p><p>Though the Tigers have had standout players across their front seven over the past few years, that group has fallen short in one particular area -- rush defense -- and it became glaring last season. The truth is, its decline began when Wes Goodwin took over as defensive coordinator. In each of his three seasons, the rush defense has gotten worse, culminating in what became a major issue in 2024. Clemson gave up 160.6 yards on the ground, and there isn't much more proof needed as to how poorly the Tigers attempted to stop the run than their playoff loss to Texas, when the Longhorns rushed for 292 yards. Clemson tackled poorly and often took bad angles. This season Tom Allen takes over after leading one of the best rushing defenses in the country at Penn State. Expect this area to be vastly improved, returning to the standard Clemson set under Brent Venables. -- <em>Andrea Adelson</em></p><hr><h2><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/251.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30">3. <a data-clubhouse-guid="013a8bab-0dd5-f6a0-45e6-1128a124f34b" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/251/texas-longhorns">Texas Longhorns</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> Middle of the defensive line</p><p>Texas has been loaded the past two seasons, but one of the reasons it made back-to-back CFP semifinal trips were the big men in the middle of the defensive line. Giant, athletic space-eaters such as T'Vondre Sweat, Vernon Broughton, Byron Murphy II and Alfred Collins made it tough to push the Longhorns around and freed up others to make plays when they weren't.

He reached a plea deal with prosecutors and returned to the team. He's an outside threat that excels at making contested catches. "Yeah, he gives you problems outside," Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. "You're going out there and there's not a lot of defense you can have for a guy that gets the ball at the highest point and goes up." -- <em>Mark Schlabach</em></p><hr><h2><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/194.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"> 5. <a data-clubhouse-guid="2fc3b71f-8247-22a5-f6da-df3902cbb438" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/194/ohio-state-buckeyes">Ohio State Buckeyes</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> TE <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4833029/max-klare">Max Klare</a></p><p>The Buckeyes landed the top tight end in the transfer portal in Klare, who arrived in Columbus from Purdue. Klare caught 51 passes for 685 years and four touchdowns during his sophomore season, easily leading the Boilermakers in those three categories. The 6-foot-4, 240-pound Klare figures to give the Buckeyes a dynamic target over the middle of the field, nicely complementing receiver <a data-player-guid="58f8add5-078d-3663-9249-0f48f77ce044" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4871023/carnell-tate">Carnell Tate</a> and All-American wideout <a data-player-guid="d946ce07-3355-3ac6-98b1-ca667acef1d7" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5079720/jeremiah-smith">Jeremiah Smith</a>.

Recent years have been good to the returning LSU starter -- Jayden Daniels being the latest example -- and Nussmeier's stats from last season compare to those of Daniels from 2022 before he won the Heisman Trophy the following year. Brian Kelly did a fantastic job in the transfer portal bolstering the roster, including getting Nussmeier plenty of weapons and added protection. If there were a situation in which a good player becomes great in 2025, it feels as if it's in Baton Rouge with Nussmeier helping Kelly achieve what he came to LSU to do. -- <em>Harry Lyles Jr.</em></p><hr><h2><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/87.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"> 7. <a data-clubhouse-guid="ebc2999c-2ff4-8435-ca46-9641e9f9ea10" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/87/notre-dame-fighting-irish">Notre Dame Fighting Irish</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> QB <a data-player-guid="9efd8aae-3821-39dd-8c77-23abfe62bcb5" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5079369/cj-carr">CJ Carr</a></p><p>Carr hasn't attempted a pass in a game yet at Notre Dame, but the quarterback is facing lofty expectations heading into the 2025 season. Carr, the grandson of former Michigan coach Lloyd Carr, is still locked in a battle with <a data-player-guid="d78b1c3d-2526-36d7-8a5c-cf8f9c5c4731" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4918099/kenny-minchey">Kenny Minchey</a> for the starting job.

After redshirting last year because of an elbow injury in his throwing arm, Carr performed well in spring practice. He appears to be the player to beat.

And yet, since the Ducks' lineage of quarterbacks (Justin Herbert, Bo Nix and Dillon Gabriel) has buoyed Oregon's offense in recent years, Moore has some big shoes to fill. The 20-year-old sophomore spent a year learning under Gabriel and offensive coordinator Will Stein after getting thrown into the fire as a true freshman starter during his lone season at UCLA. This time, the stage will be much bigger and the pressure much higher. -- <em>Paolo Uggetti</em></p><hr><h2><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/333.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"> 9. <a data-clubhouse-guid="258022c1-fed4-a0ce-c017-1f853c81d1a8" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/333/alabama-crimson-tide">Alabama Crimson Tide</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> QB <a data-player-guid="d2b7e374-7a14-319e-8474-564a6b2c7474" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4685522/ty-simpson">Ty Simpson</a></p><p>Simpson has waited his turn and had chances to win the quarterback job at Alabama, and now it's his time unless he takes a step back during preseason camp, which is something nobody at Alabama expects to happen.

Esera emerged from spring ball as a starting linebacker and has drawn rave reviews from both head coach Kalani Sitake and defensive coordinator Jay Hill.

The 6-foot-3, 275-pound Jacas led Illinois in sacks (8), tackles for loss (13), forced fumbles (3) and quarterback hurries (10) last fall, and bypassed the NFL for another chance with an Illini squad that returns most of its core players from a 10-win team. Illinois probably needs to develop more pass-rush punch around Jacas, who was the team's only consistent threat off the edge last season. The Illini also struggled a bit against good passing offenses. But if Jacas can defeat double-teams, or free up others to pressure quarterbacks, Illinois should have a chance at its first CFP appearance. -- <em>Rittenberg</em></p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/9.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2>12. <a data-clubhouse-guid="d60a0d84-8fa8-2bdf-13ec-fb0f9deda94c" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/9/arizona-state-sun-devils">Arizona State Sun Devils</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> Wide receivers beyond <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/255235/jordyn-tyson">Jordyn Tyson</a></p><p>Despite sitting out the last two games of the season, Tyson caught 75 passes in 2024.

But that speed has been a bit of his downfall through two seasons in Columbia, where he has spent spring as part of the Gamecocks' track team. Call it a distraction -- that's debatable -- but his development on the football field hasn't been quite as fast as the Gamecocks might have hoped. Harbor has started 13 games over two seasons but caught only 38 passes and three touchdowns. This spring, he focused solely on football, and he says he's poised for a breakthrough. "Going through a whole year totally committed to football, I've never had that before," Harbor said. "It's done wonders in my ability to understand the game and build off last year.

The tight end has racked up 17 touchdown catches over his first three seasons, but last year was cut short after he was injured in a win over Stanford, sitting out the rest of the season. Maryland should be back to 100% by the start of the 2025 season, and his return comes at a critical time for SMU's passing game, as six of the other seven Mustangs to reel in at least 200 receiving yards last season are gone. A healthy Maryland creates a clear-cut mismatch and forces defenses to adjust each week. He could be in line for a breakthrough season -- and if that happens, the Mustangs' offense should follow suit. -- <em>Hale</em></p><hr><h2><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2641.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30">16. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2641/texas-tech-red-raiders">Texas Tech Red Raiders</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> Defensive coordinator Shiel Wood</p><p>It really can't be overstated that this defense has to be better.

Among all the variables that could potentially lift -- or let down -- the Hoosiers' in Year 2 under coach Curt Cignetti, none feel more important than this.

Mendoza has big shoes to fill after Kurtis Rourke motored Indiana's record-setting offense to the nation's second-best points per game tally (41.3) in 2024.
