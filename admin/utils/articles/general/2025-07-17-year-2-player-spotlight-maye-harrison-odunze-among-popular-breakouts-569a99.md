However, last season was such a banner year for many rookies, is it too much to expect improved production from some of them as we prepare for our 2025 fantasy football drafts?</p><p>ESPN Fantasy Football analysts Matt Bowen, Daniel Dopp, Liz Loza and Eric Moody discuss many of the most intriguing sophomores below. Who is undervalued in fantasy drafts? Who are the popular breakout candidates? How will a pair of NFC North signal-callers respond to intense scrutiny in Year 2?</p><h2>Undervalued</h2><p><b><a data-player-guid="9c97df19-6b49-3379-ae1d-628b38d52995" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429275/trey-benson">Trey Benson</a>, RB, <a data-clubhouse-guid="8fc7b962-95e1-3cb8-6a7d-b499de9ad546" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a></b></p><p><a data-player-guid="19743ecc-58ac-c2a3-2a66-c99701051510" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045147/james-conner">James Conner</a> did something in 2024 that he had not been able to do in the previous seven seasons of his pro career: He suited up for 16 games. While the 30-year-old running back did suffer a right knee injury in Week 16 (which he attempted to play through the following week), he proved to be a consistent producer for fantasy managers. That doesn't mean Benson, Conner's backup, won't have utility in 2025, though. A power runner with 97th percentile speed, Benson was the second back selected in last year's NFL draft. Coach Jonathan Gannon has already intimated that Benson would likely have a larger role in his second campaign, which makes sense given Conner's injury history and Benson's skill set. With the <a href="https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/45112208/2025-nfl-schedule-fantasy-football-projections-stats-win-totals-odds">fourth-easiest strength of schedule among RBs</a> (according to Mike Clay) and currently being selected 158th overall in ESPN fantasy drafts, Benson is one of the highest-upside backups at the position. <i>- Loza</i></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="2fbd2f9e-624d-3e63-9bb5-9bb965782b68" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431452/drake-maye">Drake Maye</a>, QB, </b><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid="0078f353-fe3e-67ed-a42c-43cca0568e21" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a></strong></p><p>Maye didn't have the best rookie season from a raw numbers perspective, but if you look a little deeper, you can see why there's reason for optimism heading into Year 2. Not only did he deliver six games of at least 17 fantasy points, he finished sixth among QBs in rushing yards per game. Those wheels should be on full display again in 2025, but this time he might not need to use them as much. <a data-player-guid="d6ba7023-458c-f59a-4af2-638770067518" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976212/stefon-diggs">Stefon Diggs</a> joins the receiving corps as veteran presence, and there's excitement around rookie third-round WR <a data-player-guid="359ec99e-3714-88dc-c5de-1dc522b8369f" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4613202/kyle-williams">Kyle Williams</a> as well. Maye certainly needs to clean up his mistakes after finishing his rookie season with 16 turnovers against 17 total touchdowns, but he has the potential for low-end QB1 upside in 2025 thanks to his rushing floor and new-look offense. <i>- Dopp</i></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="87c807fb-79fe-e421-02d2-6536bbe0618f" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428209/ricky-pearsall">Ricky Pearsall</a>, WR, <a data-clubhouse-guid="985a261f-296c-c95c-32a5-addc4df75001" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a></b></p><p>Pearsall is WR46 in 2025 drafts, but he scored 17 points or more in three of his seven games played as a rookie. Plus, in Weeks 17 and 18, he had 14 receptions and averaged 23.8 fantasy points. A detailed route runner who can provide a vertical push in one-on-one matchups, Pearsall will also get opportunities in Kyle Shanahan's system on in-breaking concepts off play-action, which lead to big plays. With <a data-player-guid="7f300cb7-f0a1-a43a-d0b0-f8a57bf04eb3" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126486/deebo-samuel-sr">Deebo Samuel Sr</a>. now in Washington and <a data-player-guid="adf56900-5f5b-78ef-7309-892ec10e85d3" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360438/brandon-aiyuk">Brandon Aiyuk</a> recovering from a knee injury, Pearsall has upside as a potential volume target in one of the NFL's most heavily schemed offenses. <i>- Bowen</i></p><hr><h2>Breakouts</h2><p><b><a data-player-guid="7a24e799-fc0e-395e-b740-4ecee71a3c53" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432708/marvin-harrison-jr">Marvin Harrison Jr</a>., WR, Arizona Cardinals</b></p><p>Harrison was the No. 4 pick in 2024, giving him optimal breakout potential in his second season. He finished 2024 as the WR30 but ranked third in end zone targets (18), ninth in air yards (1,518) and 20th in total targets (116). A poor 59.3% catchable target rate limited his upside. With improved QB play from <a data-player-guid="9bef707d-d33f-266b-3020-81900d735915" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray">Kyler Murray</a> and a clear WR1 role, Harrison has top-15 fantasy potential in 2025. <i>- Moody</i></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="774cc71b-e83e-340d-bcda-4a8558265bb5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431299/rome-odunze">Rome Odunze</a>, WR, <a data-clubhouse-guid="19d73366-b5a5-cca2-a176-a2c024ce0bb3" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</a></b></p><p>Odunze averaged only 8.5 PPG as a rookie, as he finished with 54 receptions (on 100 targets) for 734 yards and three scores. If you look closer at the tape, though, Odunze started to develop more nuance to his route tree over the second half of the season. He has the physical tools and vertical ability, plus he is now working with an upgraded Bears offense and playcaller in Ben Johnson. I expect quarterback <a data-player-guid="dd15176c-3004-333f-beaa-149216c42968" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431611/caleb-williams">Caleb Williams</a> to play at a higher level and with a greater sense of calm under Johnson, and that will open the door for Odunze to produce breakout numbers. <i>- Bowen</i></p><hr><h2>Under the microscope</h2><p><b><a data-player-guid="bc4ba7ee-446b-36fd-9985-7fd2a94a98bc" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432665/brock-bowers">Brock Bowers</a>, TE, <a data-clubhouse-guid="b18540eb-6f2b-534c-e7f9-9bd930518da9" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-raiders">Las Vegas Raiders</a></b></p><p>Repeating a historical season isn't easy, and that's exactly what Bowers is trying to do. Only two tight ends in <i>NFL history</i> have topped 112 catches in a season, a number Bowers hit last season as a rookie. In addition, only six tight ends have seen the outrageous volume of 150-plus targets in a season. It's not that I don't have Bowers ranked as the TE1 heading into the season. I do. But things are very different in Las Vegas this season. While he does have a much better QB in <a data-player-guid="593e3c58-2b92-e0f1-f4a8-84215e27f023" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith">Geno Smith</a>, he also adds a high-volume teammate in rookie RB <a data-player-guid="fb81ea34-8566-3bda-9997-f9bf0a4ba991" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4890973/ashton-jeanty">Ashton Jeanty</a>, who should be the focal point of this new Pete Carroll offense. Jeanty is projected to have more than 340 touches, which could certainly impact Bowers' stat line. He can be hit by regression in 2025 and still be the TE1. <i>- Dopp</i></p><p><strong><a data-player-guid="dd15176c-3004-333f-beaa-149216c42968" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431611/caleb-williams">Caleb Williams</a>. QB, <a data-clubhouse-guid="19d73366-b5a5-cca2-a176-a2c024ce0bb3" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</a></strong></p><p>The Bears' brass went all-in on Williams, intent on making last year's No. 1 pick the city's eventual savior under center. Williams flashed at various points as a rookie, finishing inside the top eight fantasy producers at the position on five separate occasions. Inconsistent play (and playcalling), however, resulted in a largely underwhelming season, during which Williams was held to single-digit fantasy totals in seven games. Heading into Year 2 with a completely revamped offensive line, the addition of two highly touted rookie pass catchers (<a data-player-guid="678445c0-543b-31f1-b924-67545f33ebbb" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4723086/colston-loveland">Colston Loveland</a> and <a data-player-guid="f78ad5c7-c991-3940-b213-79f9a8d77008" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685278/luther-burden">Luther Burden III</a>) and Ben Johnson's creative genius, Williams' situation has markedly improved. He'll need to post top-10 positional numbers to consider the experiment a success. - <i>Loza</i></p><p><b><a data-player-guid="460fbf74-c64d-3862-b942-852d104e94dd" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4433970/jj-mccarthy">J.J.
