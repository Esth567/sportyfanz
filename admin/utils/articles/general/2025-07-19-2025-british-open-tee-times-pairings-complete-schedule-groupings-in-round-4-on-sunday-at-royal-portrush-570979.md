        <p>The final round of the 2025 Open Championship at Royal Portrush will feature <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-open-championship-picks-odds-rory-mcilroy-leads-golfers-capable-of-catching-soaring-scottie-scheffler/" target="_blank">Scottie Scheffler trying to convert a four-shot lead</a></span> into his first Claret Jug and fourth career major title. Scheffler put distance between himself and the field with a Saturday 67 to reach 14 under, four clear of Haotong Li (-10) in second.</p><p>Scheffler and Li &nbsp;will go off in the final game on Sunday afternoon in Northern Ireland with a 9:30 a.m. ET tee time beginning the leaders' time on the course. Topping the chasers behind the final pairing will be Rory McIlroy (-8), whose <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/the-open-2025-rory-mcilroy-contending-after-strong-66-shockingly-hitting-two-balls-on-one-shot-saturday/" target="_blank">scintillating 66</a></span> moved him into the top 5 and the penultimate group alongside Matt Fitzpatrick (-9), teeing off at 9:20 a.m. A massive crowd will be right by his side attempting to push McIlroy toward an unbelievable comeback win.</p><p>Chris Gotterup (-8) and Harris English (-8) have the unenviable task of being the opening act for McIlroy's group; they'll go off at 9:10 a.m. and try to conjure up something special to apply a little pressure to Scheffler.&nbsp;</p>
        

<p>For those looking to enjoy some early morning golf, Jon Rahm (-2) and Akshay Bhatia (-2) tee off at 6:10 a.m. as they look to find their way into a top 20 position with Bryson DeChambeau (-2) and Nathan Kimsey (-2) together for the second straight day as DeChambeau has shaken off an opening 78 to play the last two days in 9 under. Tommy Fleetwood (-3) and Justin Thomas (-3) at 6:50 a.m. will be a fun early group to follow as well, but it's all setting the table for the afternoon when Scheffler looks to take another step towards golf immortality.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's take a look at the full slate of tee times and pairings for the final round as the Claret Jug comes into focus.</p>
