        <p>Journalism will get the shot to add another win to his impressive resume at the 2025 Haskell Stakes on Saturday. The Preakness Stakes winner was the runner-up at the Belmont Stakes his last time out, and he is returning to action as the 4-5 betting favorite in the Haskell Stakes 2025 odds. He has some familiar competition in the 2025 Haskell Stakes field, such as Preakness runner-up Gosger (9-2) and Toyota Blue Grass Stakes winner Burnham Square (5-1). Goal Oriented (4-1) rounds out the top four in the eight-horse field for the 2025 Haskell Stakes, which has a post time of 5:45 p.m. ET. Track conditions are expected to be fast with the forecast calling for it to be around 78 degrees with partly cloudy conditions around post time.&nbsp;</p><p>With talented 3-year-olds entering the starting gate, <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-haskell-stakes-odds-horses-field-racing-insider-offers-best-bets-top-picks-for-saturdays-race/#ttag=07182025_agg_cbssports_picks_horseracing_Yu_HaskellStakesYu2025" target="_blank">you'll want to see what Santa Anita-based racing reporter and insider Michelle Yu has to say before making any 2025 Haskell Stakes picks.</a></p><p>Few people in racing are as well-connected as Yu. An on-air host and reporter who has provided racing analysis for TVG, HRTV and the Breeders' Cup, Yu has spent a lifetime in racing. Prior to her television career, she worked for trainers Steve Asmussen and Ron Moquett. She also is married to Santa Anita-based trainer Ryan Hanson.</p><p>Yu also has tremendous handicapping chops. She started off 2025 by correctly going all-in on Citizen Bull to win the Robert B. Lewis Stakes, and she also predicted Forever Young's win in the Saudi Cup, Journalism's win in the San Felipe Stakes, Sandman's win in the Arkansas Derby and Mindframe's win in the Churchill Downs Stakes. She also hit the exacta in the Kentucky Derby. Anyone who has followed her on those picks on betting sites like&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/twinspires-offer-code-for-kentucky-derby-2025-get-400-sign-up-bonus-site-review/" target="_blank">TwinSpires</a></span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/250-1st-bet-promo-code-use-250bet-for-preakness-bonus-online-horse-betting/" target="_blank">1/ST BET</a></span>&nbsp;is up huge.</p><p>Now, Yu has handicapped the 2025 Haskell Stakes lineup, made her picks and constructed her best bets. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-haskell-stakes-odds-horses-field-racing-insider-offers-best-bets-top-picks-for-saturdays-race/#ttag=07182025_agg_cbssports_picks_horseracing_Yu_HaskellStakesYu2025" target="_blank">You can head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.</p>
        

<h2>Top 2025 Haskell Stakes predictions</h2><p>One surprise: Yu is fading Journalism, even though he's the 4-5 betting favorite. The expert tells SportsLine she would bet the Preakness winner if he was listed at 2-1 or better, "but you're not likely to even get 1-1." The Michael W. McCarthy trainee has had a spectacular year, winning three of five starts. Those other two starts resulted in runner-up finishes at the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes, where he was only bested by Sovereignty.</p><p>"The pace should be lively enough for Journalism, and his works have been good," Yu told SportsLine. "This son of Mopotism has shipped a lot this year, but his weight has been consistent and his training has been unaffected." &nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-haskell-stakes-odds-horses-field-racing-insider-offers-best-bets-top-picks-for-saturdays-race/#ttag=07182025_agg_cbssports_picks_horseracing_Yu_HaskellStakesYu2025" target="_blank">You can see all of Yu's 2025 Haskell Stakes bets here.</a></p><h2>How to make 2025 Haskell Stakes picks</h2><p>Instead, Yu is eyeing a horse who she considers an "upset possibility." She is including this horse in her 2025 Haskell Stakes bets, and so should you.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-haskell-stakes-odds-horses-field-racing-insider-offers-best-bets-top-picks-for-saturdays-race/#ttag=07182025_agg_cbssports_picks_horseracing_Yu_HaskellStakesYu2025" target="_blank">She's sharing which 2025 Haskell Stakes horses to back at SportsLine</a>.</p>
