"He's a weapon in right field. His arm is so strong and accurate, and the ball carries, release is good. He's special out there."</p><p>Acuña caught the ball just in front of the warning track with his back to the infield. He spun and fired a throw that reached third base just in time for <a data-player-guid="49847cb5-2443-332c-9f40-b4acaa364a47" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5133834/nacho-alvarez-jr">Nacho Alvarez Jr.</a> to tag a slowing Vivas, who ignored third-base coach Luis Rojas' signal to slide.</p><p>"I just always try to anticipate those plays," Acuña said through an interpreter. "That's really what I always try to focus on, anticipating the play before it happens. I really wasn't trying to do anything besides that. Thankfully, I have a good arm."</p><p>Alvarez was casual as the throw approached in an attempt to fool Vivas, who would likely have been safe if he had run hard all the way and slid.</p><p>"[Vivas] got deked," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "That just can't happen. I did that all my career at third base. Just kind of play dumb, play dead. And that's what [Vivas] read. The body language of Alvarez there just deked him. He knew it was a deep fly ball, so it caught up to him. ... It's a lesson that that can't happen on a baseball field, especially in that situation."</p><p>It was the longest throw to complete a double play since 2021, when Adam Eaton's throw traveled 302 feet on July 4.</p><p><em>ESPN Research and The Associated Press contributed to this report. </em></p>
