Because, of course, the “Whack It Like Wyatt-Hodge” trailer was gently poking fun at the storm which erupted in September 2022, when Deepti Sharma <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/24/england-women-india-third-one-day-international-cricket" data-link-name="in body link">controversially ran out</a> Charlie Dean at the non-striker’s end.</p><p>On Saturday, therefore, there was inevitably a certain frisson when Deepti came to the crease with India 72 for five, and quickly found herself facing Dean. A crowd that had patiently sat through the four-hour rain delay, which meant the match was reduced to 29 overs a side, were suddenly on the edge of their seats.</p><p>Deepti narrowly survived the first ball of Dean’s second spell, which turned sharply and beat her bat. But she then saw off her remaining 11 balls without theatrics – eventually progressing to an unbeaten 30 as she tried to wrestle back some advantage for India, who struggled to 143 for eight on a pitch made stodgy by the rain.</p><figure id="5f80f488-06fd-417f-9ff2-13c216890228" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e49731fb393a20706f2acdbfa8435c062301295/0_0_3664_2602/master/3664.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e49731fb393a20706f2acdbfa8435c062301295/0_0_3664_2602/master/3664.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e49731fb393a20706f2acdbfa8435c062301295/0_0_3664_2602/master/3664.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e49731fb393a20706f2acdbfa8435c062301295/0_0_3664_2602/master/3664.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e49731fb393a20706f2acdbfa8435c062301295/0_0_3664_2602/master/3664.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e49731fb393a20706f2acdbfa8435c062301295/0_0_3664_2602/master/3664.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Charlie Dean kicks the ball away." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e49731fb393a20706f2acdbfa8435c062301295/0_0_3664_2602/master/3664.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="316.0180131004367" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Charlie Dean boots the ball away after taking a catch off Smriti Mandhana.</span> Photograph: Steven Paston/PA</figcaption></figure><p>Dean had to be content with holding on to a catch at extra cover to see off Smriti Mandhana for 42, after earlier taking the return catch proffered up by Jemimah Rodrigues. Sophie Ecclestone, meanwhile, took three for 27, including rattling the stumps of Harmanpreet Kaur after Sophia Dunkley had twice let off the India captain at cover.</p><p>Perhaps this match might pass without controversy, despite the recent tensions between these sides (Pratika Rawal was fined 10% of her match fee this week after barging Ecclestone and Filer during <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/16/edwards-left-with-food-for-thought-as-india-edge-england-in-first-womens-odi" data-link-name="in body link">the first ODI</a> at Southampton)? No: it was simply biding its time. The real drama came in the second act, in the fifth over of England’s run chase, when Tammy Beaumont appeared to deliberately kick the ball out of the way of the wicketkeeper, Richa Ghosh. Ghosh appealed for Beaumont to be given out obstructing the field, the umpires referred it upstairs, but Jacqueline Williams adjudged that Beaumont had merely been making her way back to her crease after deciding against taking a single.</p><p>“Richa [Ghosh] and Jemi [Rodrigues] definitely felt that maybe she kicked it, but the umpires referred it and it was not out,” Mandhana said. As for the fact that the bowler who sent down the ball in question happened to be Deepti Sharma? “We cracked a joke about Lord’s and Deepti.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="b55c01dd-d986-4bf4-8686-af855eceda55" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Tammy Beaumont in discussions with the umpires." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="307.32602118003024" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Tammy Beaumont in discussions with the umpires after India thought she had obstructed the field.</span> Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Amy Jones described the incident as “weird”. “I’ve never been out there for one of those before,” she said. “Tammy had no intent of actually obstructing them, she was just trying to get back into her crease.”</p><p>Beaumont added just nine more runs before Sneh Rana trapped her leg-before, attempting a reverse sweep, but – after a brief further delay for rain, in which five more overs were lost and England’s target was revised to 115 – an unbeaten 46 from Jones ensured England eventually got across the line with relative ease. That was despite an attempt at time-wasting by India, who referred a not-out caught-behind decision against Dunkley, despite Ghosh being overheard on the stump microphone telling Harmanpreet that Dunkley had not made contact with the ball. “We tried not to get drawn into it,” Jones said.</p><p>The series decider takes place at Durham on Tuesday: don’t be surprised if there is more drama still to come.</p></div></div>
