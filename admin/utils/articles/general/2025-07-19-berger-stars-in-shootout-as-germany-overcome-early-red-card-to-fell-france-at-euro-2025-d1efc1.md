It was a blatant, cynical foul and frankly bizarre behaviour from the 33-year-old Hendrich, one of the most experienced players on the pitch. Grace Geyoro duly stepped up and did what scarcely anybody has been able to do in this tournament so far and converted her penalty. Berger got a hand to Geyoro’s spot-kick but could not keep it out and the midfielder became France’s all-time top scorer at Women’s European Championships.</p><p>For the remainder of the first half, Germany defied their numerical disadvantage with a brave performance of counterattacking football and they equalised when Sjoeke Nüsken darted to the near post, unmarked, to meet Klara Bühl’s corner and loop an excellent header into the far corner.</p><p>France thought they had scored an outstanding team goal before half-time, when Delphine Cascarino’s instinctive backheel into the net rounded off a flowing move, but Cascarino had been in an offside position. Another offside flag decision, confirmed by the video assistant referee, also ruled out a French “goal” early in the second half, when Geyoro tucked in on the rebound from Berger’s close-range save from Marie-Antoinette Katoto, but Maëlle Lakrar was offside and deemed to have interfered with play, much to the frustration of France and Geyoro, who had run to celebrate with her jubilant teammates next to the substitutes bench.</p><figure id="ea6ab20d-2ae8-4e27-9e15-db631dffbf0d" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Sjoeke Nüsken of Germany celebrates her equaliser" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Sjoeke Nüsken of Germany celebrates her equaliser after her side had already been reduced to 10 players.</span> Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Germany were doing an excellent job of stifling their opponents with a valiant defensive display and then – suddenly – at the other end, they were awarded a penalty when Selma Bacha clumsily fouled the superb Jule Brand.

She was magnificent again in the shootout, making two saves – including the decisive sudden-death strike from Alice Sombath – to complete a stunning result. On the way she also scored one of her own.</p><p>The result ensured that France’s long wait for a first major trophy in the women’s game will continue, as they exit at the quarter-final stage of this competition for the fourth time in the past five editions of the Women’s Euros. The teams also met in the semi-finals of the Euros three years ago in Milton Keynes, when the Germans emerged victorious after a talismanic performance from their now-retired striker Alexandra Popp, but this was supposedly a new France, a fresher France, and more technically impressive France team and one which had enjoyed three wins out of three to finish top of Group D, scoring 11 group-stage goals in the process. Yet they could not break this stubborn Germany defence down and they will surely see this as the greatest of all their many missed opportunities down the years.</p></div></div>
