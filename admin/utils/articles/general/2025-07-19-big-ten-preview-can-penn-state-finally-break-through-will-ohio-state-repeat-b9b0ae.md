He covers college football, soccer and tennis. He has been at ESPN since 2019.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p>In 2023, Jim Harbaugh's Michigan Wolverines completed a nine-year title pursuit, filled with setbacks and plenty of losses to Ohio State, by defeating future conference mate Washington in the College Football Playoff championship. In 2024, Ryan Day's Ohio State Buckeyes used the extra mulligan offered by a 12-team CFP to get right after a tough rivalry loss to Michigan -- OSU's fourth in a row -- and maul the rest of the field on the way to four wins and a title.</p><p>Top to bottom, the Big Ten isn't college football's best conference, but it's the biggest, and it has produced the past two national champions. And it could very well produce a third straight in 2025. The odds are about one-in-three, per SP+.</p><p>Obviously Ohio State has a chance to repeat -- that's how life works when you have blue-chippers galore and two of the five or so best players in the country. But after two years of completed redemption arcs, the ultimate breakthrough and redemption could be on the horizon this fall. After 11 seasons, five AP top-10 finishes and, of course, 10 losses to Ohio State, James Franklin appears to have put together his most complete Penn State team yet, one that has received plenty of hype in <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45025016/way-too-early-college-football-post-spring-top-25-ranking-2025">the Way-Too-Early rankings</a>.</p><p>An easy early schedule means Penn State probably won't be tested until about Week 5 this fall. In the meantime, Ohio State and Michigan play huge early games, and we get to keep our eye out for this year's Indiana, an upstart with just the right transfer alchemy and just the right schedule, and this year's Illinois, a team that gets just the right breaks and capitalizes on them.</p><p>Who lives up to the hype (or doesn't)? Who surprises us this time around? Let's preview the Big Ten.</p><p><em>Every week through the summer, Bill Connelly will preview another FBS conference, ultimately including all 136 FBS teams. The previews include 2024 breakdowns, 2025 previews and team-by-team capsules.

The Nittany Lions and Buckeyes took over in the Big Ten mantle in the postseason after the regular season produced a couple of other dynamite stories. Oregon rolled unbeaten through its first Big Ten slate, beating OSU and PSU along the way, and in its first year under Curt Cignetti, Indiana started 10-0 and ended up with its first AP top-10 finish in 57 years. The Ducks and Hoosiers went 0-2 in the CFP, but it was a brilliant season all the same.</p><p>It's easy to lose track of storylines when you have an 18-team conference, but there were plenty of others here, from Illinois' overshadowed 10-win season, to 2023's national title game participants (Michigan and Washington) collapsing to a combined 14-12 record -- thanks to late wins over Ohio State and Alabama, Michigan still ended up pretty happy -- to Nebraska bowling for the first time since 2016, to Wisconsin <i>missing</i> a bowl for the first time since 2001, to Purdue collapsing to depths a power-conference team should never see.</p><hr><h2>Continuity table</h2><p>The continuity table looks at each team's returning production levels (offense, defense and overall), the number of 2024 FBS starts from both returning and incoming players and the approximate number of redshirt freshmen on the roster heading into 2025. (Why "approximate"? Because schools sometimes make it very difficult to ascertain who redshirted and who didn't.) Continuity is an increasingly difficult art in roster management, but some teams pull it off better than others.</p><p>Illinois and Indiana both return top-40 levels of production after last season's surprise runs, which is awfully intriguing, and Penn State's returnees are in the top 25 after reaching last season's semifinals. That's a huge reason for its 2025 hype. Last year's other top teams, Ohio State and Oregon, lost quite a bit, though ranking in the 90s after winning the national title is pretty normal. (Note: Oregon's production totals and returning starts don't include those of receiver <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4685565/evan-stewart">Evan Stewart</a>, who could sit out the 2025 season because of injury.)</p><p>By the way, if you're intrigued by the roster flips of the 2020s, Purdue's your team. New head coach Barry Odom, who flipped UNLV into something impressive in 2023, had more than 50 players transfer out and 50 new players enter. The Boilermakers bring up the rear in this department, but with how genuinely terrible they were last season, that's not much of a concern.</p><hr><h2>2025 projections</h2><p>Ohio State starts out on top after last season's title run, but with two new coordinators and a new starting quarterback, the Buckeyes certainly have some questions to answer. Penn State's questions, meanwhile, are mostly existential: The Nittany Lions have ridiculous experience and maybe the best coordinator duo in the country after Franklin brought in defensive coordinator Jim Knowles from Ohio State. But can they clear the hurdles that have so bedeviled them in the past?</p><p>Elsewhere, Oregon looks to avoid falling too far after losing a ton of last year's production, Michigan looks to rebound properly, Illinois and Indiana both seek happy encores, and we wait to find out which team from outside the top 25 wins the close games and gets the right breaks for a run at the CFP. The candidates are endless.</p><p>Even with the uncertainty and variance I bake into these conference title odds, it's very much a "big four versus everyone else" thing here, with Ohio State, Penn State, Oregon and Michigan combining for a 70% chance of winning the league. It feels as if it should be closer to about 90%.</p><hr><h2>10 best games of 2025</h2><p>Here are the 10 games -- eight in conference play, plus two huge nonconference games -- that feature (A) the highest combined SP+ ratings for both teams and (B) a projected scoring margin under 10 points. That second part is key, as neither Penn State (two) nor Ohio State (three) have many projected close games on the docket.</p><p><strong>Texas at Ohio State (Aug. 30) and Michigan at Oklahoma (Sept. 6).</strong> The biggest games of Weeks 1 and 2 are Big Ten vs. SEC affairs, though they take on different flavors. Texas-Ohio State is a rematch of <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401677191/ohio-state-texas">last year's delightful CFP semifinal</a>, in which Jack Sawyer's late scoop-and-score ended a Longhorns comeback attempt. Both the Longhorns and Buckeyes will almost certainly start out in the AP top 5. Meanwhile, Michigan and Oklahoma are looking for ways back into the top 10, and both will bring remodeled offenses to the table.</p><p><strong>Illinois at Indiana (Sept. 20).</strong> If things play out as forecasted and we have two different races going on in the Big Ten -- the big names vying for the conference title and the pool of 14 other teams fighting among each other for another playoff spot -- then this is the biggest Illinois-Indiana game of all time. The loser will have to be just about perfect to get to 10-2 and a potential bid.</p><p><strong>Oregon at Penn State (Sept. 27).</strong> The Week 5 slate is overloaded with big games, but this will almost certainly be the biggest. The Ducks and Nittany Lions will almost certainly be a combined 7-0 at this point, as neither team will have played a top-50 team.</p><p><strong>USC at Illinois (Sept. 27) and Indiana at Iowa (Sept. 27).</strong> Like I said, there's just way too much going on in Week 5. Goodness.</p><p><strong>Michigan at USC (Oct. 11).</strong> By this point, Michigan will have already played at Oklahoma and Nebraska and could be 5-0 and in the top 10, or 3-2 and flailing. USC will have just visited Illinois and could be 5-0 or flailing as well. This game will be huge, for any of about 17 different reasons.</p><p><strong>Penn State at Ohio State (Nov. 1).</strong> In terms of combined SP+ ratings, this is the single biggest game of the 2025 regular season.</p><p><strong>Indiana at Penn State (Nov. 8).</strong> Whether PSU is coming off of a win or a loss in Columbus, the Nittany Lions will desperately need to move on and avoid a hangover.</p><p><strong>Ohio State at Michigan (Nov. 29).</strong> Proof that even in a 12-team CFP era, a rivalry loss can send you into a spectacular, existential tailspin. (And proof that you might be able to steer out of it a little better now.)</p><hr><h2>Conference title (and, therefore, CFP) contenders</h2><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/194.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="2fc3b71f-8247-22a5-f6da-df3902cbb438" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/194/ohio-state-buckeyes">Ohio State Buckeyes</a></h2><p><strong>Head coach:</strong> Ryan Day (seventh year, 70-10 overall)</p><p><strong>2025 projection:</strong> First in SP+, 10.3 average wins (7.7 in the Big Ten)</p><p>Just trust the product. It's something I found myself repeating frequently as playoff expansion skeptics complained about how we would be losing the integrity of the regular season -- "Alabama will sit players for the Iron Bowl because the result doesn't matter!" and whatnot. But if last year's Michigan-Ohio State game taught us anything, it's that games like that will always matter. The Wolverines' fourth straight win over the Buckeyes completely reversed how Michigan fans would look back at 2024, and it sent Ohio State, and especially its fans, into a weekslong tailspin even though Ohio State still safely secured a playoff spot. The regular season is going to remain a delight because college football is a delight. Just trust the product.</p><p>That ended up applying to Ohio State too. The dud against Michigan cost Day's Buckeyes a potential CFP bye, but they regrouped and unleashed their star power, winning four CFP games by an average score of 36-19. It wasn't a total surprise -- they entered the postseason still ranked first in SP+, after all -- but it was quite the show of strength.</p><p>A lot of names will be different this time. The Buckeyes start out first in SP+, but they'll have two new coordinators (Brian Hartline on offense, Matt Patricia on defense) leading a lineup that returns basically 5.5 combined starters. There are former blue-chippers everywhere you look, and receiver <a data-player-guid="d946ce07-3355-3ac6-98b1-ca667acef1d7" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5079720/jeremiah-smith">Jeremiah Smith</a> and safety <a data-player-guid="12c8597c-e9ff-36ba-a51a-61c91d87abf7" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4870706/caleb-downs">Caleb Downs</a> are two of the most proven players in the country. But both lines are starting over, and of the four players with more than 750 yards from scrimmage last season, only Smith returns.</p><p>It's hard to be inspired by the new coordinator hires. In Hartline's first job as OC in 2023, the Buckeyes crashed to 34th in offensive SP+ and Day hired Chip Kelly for a year. With Kelly off to the NFL again, Hartline gets a do-over. As for Patricia, well, he has loads of NFL experience and was mentored by Bill Belichick, but the last time he performed well in any capacity (from a statistical standpoint) was 2016.</p><p>That said, talent rules, and both Hartline and Patricia will oversee loads of it. Likely starting quarterback <a data-player-guid="a6aa83fc-7532-319a-9f31-6e7df09edda6" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5079712/julian-sayin">Julian Sayin</a> was a top-10 recruit in 2024, Smith and <a data-player-guid="58f8add5-078d-3663-9249-0f48f77ce044" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4871023/carnell-tate">Carnell Tate</a> are a terrifying receiver duo (and there are countless other former blue-chippers available), likely starting running back <a data-player-guid="043c520c-c34a-3656-8520-ce62dc7cf76d" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5110454/james-peoples">James Peoples</a> is a former top-200 recruit with excellent yards-after-contact potential (West Virginia starter <a data-player-guid="5d205f77-2a27-3827-a9ac-7cf94c9ef977" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5081999/cj-donaldson-jr">CJ Donaldson Jr</a>. is physical too), and the offensive line has 12 former blue-chippers and six players with starting experience, including two transfers.</p><p>The ingredients are just as high end on defense.

I wish I liked the new hires more, but if the Buckeyes repeat as champs, we'll all act as if we assumed it all along.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/213.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="899b6845-67a4-16b2-c4a6-2406312be7fc" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/213/penn-state-nittany-lions">Penn State Nittany Lions</a></h2><p><strong>Head coach:</strong> James Franklin (12th year, 101-42 overall)</p><p><strong>2025 projection:</strong> Third in SP+, 10.4 average wins (7.4 in the Big Ten)</p><p>Franklin has made college football predictable in an almost jarring way: Over the past three seasons, Penn State is 34-2 as a favorite, 27-0 when favored by at least six points. Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions are 0-6 as underdogs. They win and lose the games they're supposed to. That makes them very successful. It also gives them a glass ceiling.</p><p>If that doesn't change now, will it ever? Penn State has more proven entities than any team in college football in 2025. Franklin is one of the sport's best head coaches, offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki helped PSU improve from 30th to ninth in offensive SP+ in his first season calling plays, and in the past decade alone, new defensive coordinator Jim Knowles has crafted Oklahoma State's best defense in 15 years, Ohio State's best in 25 and Duke's best in 60-plus.

The No. 2 pocket passer in the 2022 recruiting class, he was seen as a savior from the moment he arrived in Happy Valley; it was going to be almost impossible for him to live up to the hype. But after an up-and-down 2023 debut, he improved in his first year with Kotelnicki, throwing for 3,327 yards and 24 touchdowns and finishing 17th in Total QBR. He's clearly good, but it's difficult to win three or four CFP games with a merely top-20 quarterback. He probably needs to prove he has one more gear, though having such an outstanding supporting cast will help.</p><p>If PSU continues the "win as a favorite, lose as a dog" thing in 2025, the Nittany Lions probably will reach the Big Ten championship game again, having lost only at Ohio State on Nov. 1. They'll probably be favored in every other game, especially through a ridiculously weak nonconference slate (Nevada, Florida International, Villanova). Rarely do all the arrows point in the right direction the way they are for the Nittany Lions heading into this season.

McCarthy and Blake Corum, Michigan basically played with one hand tied behind its back. The Wolverines went unbeaten when scoring at least 24 points (national scoring average: 28.0), but they reached that mark in only six of 13 games thanks primarily to a black hole at the QB position. They ranked 91st in Total QBR and 131st -- last nationally among non-service academies -- in passing yards per game (129.1). They ran the ball until they had to punt, then hoped the defense would make stops and maybe set up some points. They indeed managed to beat OSU and Bama with scores of 13-10 and 19-13, but one expects far more from a defending national champion.</p><p>Either five-star freshman <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/42531006/bryce-underwood-no-1-recruit-2025-flips-michigan-lsu">Bryce Underwood</a> or veteran transfer <a data-player-guid="16ff6e44-2116-313b-bdac-e3d64eb3efa5" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4597499/mikey-keene">Mikey Keene</a> (Fresno State) will begin the season at QB for Moore's second Michigan team, and it's probably fair to assume that Underwood will finish it there.

Still, the Wolverines' No. 10 defensive SP+ ranking in 2024 was their worst in a full season since 2018 -- they have a track record.</p><p>The No. 10 ranking in SP+ is certainly aggressive.

Illinois was one of only three teams ranked in the top 25 in all three categories -- turnovers (23rd), close-game fortune (10th) and lineup stability (21st). The Illini won two overtime games, scored on the final play of regulation to beat Rutgers and made late stops to preserve their leads against Kansas and South Carolina.

Locksley compared his Terps to Macy's, trying to keep both the higher-end "Saks Fifth Avenues of college football" from plucking away his best talent and the discount stores from taking away his young backups. "I'm getting eaten from both ends, and that's why you don't see f---ing Macy's very much anymore," he said.</p><p>I thought about that quote a lot as Maryland got absolutely wrecked by the portal this offseason, losing starters and key contributors to Arkansas, Auburn, Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Ole Miss, Texas, UAB (really?) and Wisconsin, and losing backups to Coastal Carolina, East Carolina, Fresno State, Georgia State, James Madison, Sacramento State, Sam Houston and UCF. Maryland had already suffered a disastrous 2024 season, collapsing to 4-8 and 86th in SP+, then got hit harder by spring attrition than almost any power conference program. The Terps are 107th in returning production and looking at only about a one-in-three chance of bowling this fall. Locksley had engineered three straight winning seasons and two top-30 SP+ finishes, but it feels as if he's starting from scratch in Year 7.</p><p>There's almost no choice but to go with a full youth movement in 2025, but it could bear decent fruit. Blue-chip freshman <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/254623/malik-washington">Malik Washington</a> could start at quarterback next to sophomore running back (and yards-after-contact machine) <a data-player-guid="69148cfb-31f3-3dee-b04f-7b1b258c2afb" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4921316/nolan-ray">Nolan Ray</a> and behind a line that might feature only one or two seniors.

Well, Stone will be an upgrade as long as he rediscovers his 2023 form. He threw for 3,197 yards with a 28-to-6 TD-to-INT ratio that year but struggled early in 2024 and was benched for <a data-player-guid="15c25e32-2bdd-381f-b508-83ecf26d6d8f" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5084084/kevin-jennings">Kevin Jennings</a>. He's an interesting combination of aggressive (15.1 yards per completion for his career) and safe (eight career INTs), but he can be inefficient.

And hey, the bar couldn't be lower. Pilot a top-75 offense, and you'll look like a savior.</p><p>The Wildcats slipped to 51st in defensive SP+ last season, though that includes some pretty demoralizing late-season results. They still started (31st in three-and-out rate) and ended drives well (31st in red zone TD rate allowed), and they'll have some proven entities in linebacker <a data-player-guid="0392e7ea-493e-3e05-9e4c-0b8807e07a2b" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4570043/mac-uihlein">Mac Uihlein</a>, end <a data-player-guid="6d66ab4e-bfaa-3123-a1d8-34710f802b43" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4603089/aidan-hubbard">Aidan Hubbard</a> and tackle <a data-player-guid="0c2213b5-e515-3d11-b558-d7f46440d0f8" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4431572/najee-story">Najee Story</a>.

If Northwestern's success is again dependent on having a top-20 defense, disappointment probably awaits. But if the O genuinely improves and the D has to be only top 40 or so, the Wildcats could surprise. Either way, facing Oregon, Penn State, Michigan and Illinois will make reaching six wins awfully difficult.</p><hr><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2509.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60" width="30"></p><h2><a data-clubhouse-guid="1f5f7b3a-6fac-b606-8dbe-3664c2d38f6b" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2509/purdue-boilermakers">Purdue Boilermakers</a></h2><p><strong>Head coach:</strong> Barry Odom (first year)</p><p><strong>2025 projection:</strong> 101st in SP+, 2.9 average wins (1.2 in the Big Ten)</p><p>When the bottom falls out at Purdue, <i>the bottom falls out</i>.
