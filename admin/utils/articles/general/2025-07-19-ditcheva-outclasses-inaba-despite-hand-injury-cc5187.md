I think I'm gutted because I've been out for so long and then I'm injured again, but I hope you guys enjoyed it," said a teary Ditcheva.</p><p>The bout was the 26-year-old's first in eight months after becoming the first British woman to win an MMA world title in November.</p><p>Ditcheva had <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/mixed-martial-arts/articles/cqjqxr9221xo">voiced her frustrations</a> pre-fight at the eight-month lay-off but confirmed after beating Inaba she has signed a new deal with the PFL.</p><p>"I have just re-signed with PFL, we've come to a great agreement and I'm gonna look forward to the next few years together in front of crowds like this. You guys really set a standard," she revealed.</p><p>The fight card was also the first major MMA event to take place in Africa and Ditcheva paid tribute to the crowd, adding "that was the best walkout I've ever had, thank you so much".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ditcheva had been vocal about her time away from the cage in the build-up to the bout, blaming a lack of credible opponents for the delay.</p><p>She cruised through the PFL flyweight tournament last year with four straight stoppages and, with many of her opponents fighting in this year's competition, saw little value in entering it again.</p><p>She was eventually paired up with Inaba based on the 34-year-old winning eight of her nine professional bouts, while Ditcheva added "there is no denying her skill level".</p><p>Although Inaba showed courage and admirable durability throughout, the Briton remained a class above.</p><p>Inaba started by pushing forward but it didn't take long for Ditcheva to initiate the clinch and take control - as she would throughout the fight - to land a number of damaging knees.</p><p>She stunned Inaba in the second round with an elbow and flurry of strikes, but Inaba showed grit to take the flyweight champion to the third round for the first time in six bouts.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Dakota Ditcheva elbows Sumiko Inaba" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1248/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/d793/live/2c851750-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 976w" width="1248" height="702.1867517956904"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>PFL</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Much of Ditcheva's good work was done from the clinch</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Dakota Ditcheva throws a high kick at Sumiko Inaba" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1248/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/22a7/live/52d1ee60-64ea-11f0-a989-55a21fab730d.png 976w" width="1248" height="702.3117505995203"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>PFL</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Ditcheva threw more kicks after injuring her hand in the final round</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>With the crowd chanting her name, Ditcheva landed more crunching knees from the clinch before adopting a more careful approach after injuring her hand after a punch. </p><p>Inaba was already too worn down to take advantage, however, as her opponent used kicks to maintain distance before showboating and cupping her ears to the crowd in victory.</p><p>In the main event, Spain's Costello van Steenis beat American Johnny Eblen to win the PFL middleweight title in a remarkable finish.</p><p>With Eblen seemingly heading towards a decision victory, Van Steenis secured a rear-naked choke, forcing the submission with just nine seconds of the bout remaining.</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More MMA from the BBC</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
