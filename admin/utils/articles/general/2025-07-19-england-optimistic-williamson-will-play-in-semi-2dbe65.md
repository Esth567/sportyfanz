I want what's best for the team, and that's absolutely having our captain on the pitch," said Morgan.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"It is the same as every single game - be prepared to play if I'm needed, know the role, just be absolutely ready and train at a high level over the next few days. But we're very optimistic that Leah will be fine."</p><p>Morgan made her tournament debut against Sweden, coming on in the 70th minute to help England bounce back from a 2-0 deficit.</p><p>"It was really, really special. Apparently my mum was sobbing when I came on, bless her. It doesn't take much to set her off watching the football," said Morgan. </p><p>"I think she was crying again when we won, so a lot of tears were shed. It was just really nice to get that opportunity.</p><p>"I have been working hard throughout the tournament to stay prepared if I was called on. I felt really ready when that happened to be able to make an impact. </p><p>"I was really excited and to be able to turn it around and get the win at the end was such a joyous moment."</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Esme Morgan's half-time England admission</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>England will play in their seventh women's Euros semi-final, having progressed from two of the past three - in 2009 and 2022.</p><p>They are the first reigning champions to reach a semi-final since Germany 12 years ago.</p><p>Wiegman is looking to reach a third successive final, having done so with the Netherlands in 2017 and England in 2022.</p><p>Asked about England's regular success at major tournaments, Morgan said: "When you speak to Lucy Bronze and Alex Greenwood about it, because they've been part of many tournaments, it's amazing speaking to them about the journey and the things that have changed.</p><p>"It's a big source of pride that England have got to the latter stages of this tournament.</p><p>"We've had three must-win games that we've come through now.
