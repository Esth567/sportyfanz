description: "Bloodied-nose penalty heroine against Sweden was born with a serious eye condition that still affects her vision The image of Terry Butcher’s blood-stained shirt during an England draw against Sweden in 1989 is immortalised in the country’s football history. Now another English player’s stoic display against Sweden – this time with a bloodied nose – will be etched into the annals after Hannah Hampton’s heroics during the Lionesses’ remarkable shootout victory over Sweden in Zurich. Hampton, with an absorbent shoved up her right nostril after an extra-time collision in the penalty area caused a nosebleed, found the composure, focus and agility to save two Sweden penalties to help Sarina Wiegman’s team win 3-2 in the shootout and book Tuesday’s semi-final meeting with Italy after an unlikely comeback to draw 2-2 after extra time.

Hampton was confirmed by Wiegman as England’s No 1 after Mary Earps <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/27/england-goalkeeper-mary-earps-retires-from-international-football-before-euro-2025" data-link-name="in body link">retired from international football</a> in May. It had been the direction of travel but those were big gloves to fill.

She underwent multiple operations as a youngster to try to correct her vision but still has depth-perception issues. Hampton, though, has defied the medical odds to thrive for club and country, winning a domestic treble of trophies with Chelsea this year. Her performance against Sweden, nosebleed and all, was her biggest moment yet with England.</p><p>“As a few of the girls have said, I’m better with one nostril so maybe I’ll have it [a nosebleed] again in the next game to be honest,” Hampton joked after the match. “The girls have got behind me a lot. They know how tough it’s been for me while being in and around the England environment. To be able to go out and help them tonight, for the whole team to put on a performance like we did, it’s a lovely moment.</p><p>“All the girls were ecstatic. They’ve seen all the hard work that I’ve put in and how difficult it’s been and how they’ve helped me get to the point that I am now and being happy to be wearing an England shirt again. I just want to do whatever I can for the team to get that win. I don’t care if I have one touch in a game or if I have multiple … We just didn’t want to go home.”</p><p>Hampton appeared to be alluding to a period in the autumn of 2022 was she was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/31/hannah-hampton-dropped-by-england-over-attitude-euros-winner-aston-villa" data-link-name="in body link">dropped from the England team</a>, with Wiegman saying at the time “she has some personal issues that she has to solve so for her, at this moment, it’s better for her to stay at her club”. On Thursday night, Wiegman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/18/sarina-wiegman-reaction-hannah-hampton-england-euro-2025-sweden-shootout" data-link-name="in body link">was full of praise</a> for Hampton and said there had never been doubts within the Lionesses camp over whether Hampton could deliver. The England forward Beth Mead said: “Sometimes you need your goalkeeper to step up and Hannah did that today. Hannah made some amazing saves.”</p><figure id="eaada69e-c1c1-4c94-a93e-2f116dc5c250" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62bf4fa9ed740b5f005c68d4e03c831e5f030054/0_0_3000_2107/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62bf4fa9ed740b5f005c68d4e03c831e5f030054/0_0_3000_2107/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62bf4fa9ed740b5f005c68d4e03c831e5f030054/0_0_3000_2107/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62bf4fa9ed740b5f005c68d4e03c831e5f030054/0_0_3000_2107/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62bf4fa9ed740b5f005c68d4e03c831e5f030054/0_0_3000_2107/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62bf4fa9ed740b5f005c68d4e03c831e5f030054/0_0_3000_2107/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Hannah Hampton has a nosebleed." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62bf4fa9ed740b5f005c68d4e03c831e5f030054/0_0_3000_2107/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="312.53833333333336" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Hannah Hampton joked that she was ‘better with one nostril’ after an extra-time collision.</span> Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>It was the first Women’s European Championship fixture to be decided by penalty kicks since 2017, no shootouts having been required when England hosted the tournament in 2022, and the nerve-shredding drama in Zurich appeared to be trying to make up for that long wait. Sweden twice missed kicks to win the contest and only five of the 14 spot-kicks were successfully converted. The player who scored England’s crucial seventh penalty was the right-back Lucy Bronze, who also offered up some imagery that will define how the night will be remembered.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The Chelsea defender required strapping around her right thigh late in extra time but, because the medical team were tending to Alex Greenwood and Hampton, Bronze applied the tape around her own leg while sitting on the pitch, epitomising the same battle-hardened attitude as her goalkeeper. The former Barcelona player then ripped off her bandages moments before stepping up to fire her penalty emphatically down the middle of the goal and put England on the verge of victory.
