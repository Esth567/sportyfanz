He would love and arguably prefer a shot at the world title. </p><p>"If that presented itself, then we would definitely look at that option."</p><p>Benn, 28, has also claimed to be looking at alternative options, with a move back down to welterweight on the cards.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He told BBC Sport: "We signed a two-fight deal, we were ready to go. The date was announced straight after the first fight for September, done a lot of negotiations in terms of venues, dates. </p><p>"They had all agreed September 20th, then Eubank came out and said he wasn't ready."</p><p>Asked if Benn was prepared to wait until the end of the year, Hearn added: "So we have to give them a chance.</p><p>"We just appeal to Eubank, if you're not ready to go back to war with Benn and you'd rather sit at a poker table in Las Vegas, good luck to you. But let us move on."</p><p>"We're ready to move on, drop down to 147 and get a world title," said Benn.</p><p>The first fight was organised by Ring Magazine, which is owned by Turki Alalshikh, and it was thought the rematch would also fall under the Riyadh Season promotion.</p><p>Appearing on Saturday's broadcast before Oleksandr Usyk's win over Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium, Alalshikh said the Eubank-Benn bout could still happen and suggested January or February as potential alternative dates.</p><p>Eubank has not commented on the situation himself, and it is unclear when an official decision will be made.</p><p>The 35-year-old <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/cn81jvd0mx2o">was fined Â£10,000</a> earlier this month by the British Boxing Board of Control over "misuse of social media" in the build-up to the first contest.</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More boxing from the BBC</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
