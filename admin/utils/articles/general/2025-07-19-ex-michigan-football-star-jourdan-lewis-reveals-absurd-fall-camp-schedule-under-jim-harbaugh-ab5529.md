        <p>Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback and former <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/">Michigan</a> football star Jourdan Lewis provided an inside look into Jim Harbaugh's tenure with the Wolverines this week, <a href="https://x.com/jourdanjd/status/1945960034229199115" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">revealing an absurd fall camp schedule</a> during his time as a scholarship athlete prior to the program's annual success among the elites.</p><p>Michigan went 86-25 overall under Harbaugh, including three consecutive top-five finishes prior to his return to the <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL</a>.</p><p>"We did this everyday, 6 days a week, for a month," <a href="https://x.com/jourdanjd/status/1945960034229199115" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lewis captioned a photo on X</a>.</p><p>The schedule reflects what was expected of a Michigan player months after Harbaugh took the job in 2015, a sun up to sun down game plan for development during August.</p>
        

<p>Handing players a road map to success with a regimented schedule is nothing out of the ordinary in major <a href="https://cbssports.com/college-football/">college football</a>, but even this slate -- without zero time allotted to be a college student -- is a bit extreme. After three hours of afternoon practice during fall camp following a morning filled with obligations, Michigan players then had a one-hour lift, a food break, two hours of meetings, another meal at 10 p.m. and then curfew.</p>
<p>Known for his attention to detail, Harbaugh ran a tight ship with the Wolverines&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/jim-harbaugh-suspended-by-big-ten-michigan-coach-banned-from-final-three-games-of-2023-regular-season/" target="_blank">prior to multiple NCAA clouds over his program for various recruiting violations</a></span> and scouting discrepancies. He won a College Football Playoff national championship at Michigan to end the 2023 season, a perfect campaign equaling the best in program history.</p><p>Harbaugh took the <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ravens-john-harbaugh-on-jim-harbaugh-landing-in-the-nfl-the-chargers-just-got-themselves-one-great-coach/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Chargers' coaching vacancy soon thereafter</a></span> and left the remaining staffers, including promoted head coach Sherrone Moore, to deal with ramifications of a sign-stealing scandal orchestrated by former staffer Connor Stalions.</p>

<p>Lewis played two seasons under Harbaugh in Ann Arbor before he was selected in the third round of the 2017 <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/">NFL Draft</a> by the Dallas Cowboys. <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/longtime-cowboys-cb-jourdan-lewis-signs-with-afc-team-on-three-year-30-million-deal-per-report/" target="_blank">Lewis signed a three-year, $30 million deal with the Jaguars</a></span> in March and will aid <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/JAX/jacksonville-dolphins/">Jacksonville</a>'s secondary as its top nickel option.</p><p>During Lewis' time at Michigan, <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/15193010/jim-harbaugh-michigan-wolverines-coach-says-ncaa-decision-ban-satellite-camps-self-serving" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the NCAA outlawed satellite camps</a> due in large part to Harbaugh's participation in previous summer camps involving high school recruits.
