        <p>The <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/">Atlanta Falcons</a> haven't reached the playoffs since 2017 -- a seven-year skid that ranks among the <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/">NFL's</a> longest, trailing only the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/">New York Jets</a> (14 years). But with second-year quarterback <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963496/michael-penix-jr/">Michael Penix Jr</a>. taking the reins in 2025, some in Atlanta aren't just thinking postseason -- they're thinking <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/">Super Bowl</a>.</p><p>"I'm excited, and I'm not gonna be surprised by any of it," Falcons wide receiver <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179226/ray-ray-mccloud/">Ray-Ray McCloud</a> <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/exclusive-atlanta-falcons-ray-ray-mccloud-super-bowl/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">told</a> Pro Football Network recently. "I've watched [Penix] every day for the last year at practice, and I'm just ready to see him go into an experienced year, a polished year, and see how it goes -- go all the way to the Super Bowl."</p><p>Penix&nbsp;took over as Atlanta's starting quarterback for the final three games of the 2024 season, going 1-2 down the stretch with both losses coming in overtime. He made a strong first impression, guiding the Falcons to a 34-7 rout of the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/">New York Giants</a> in his debut.</p><p>While Penix is set to lead the Falcons in 2025, veteran <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272574/kirk-cousins/">Kirk Cousins</a> remains on the roster after Atlanta was unable to find a trade partner this offseason. His presence adds depth and experience to the quarterback room as the team transitions to its promising young signal caller, who was selected with the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 <a href="https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/">NFL Draft</a>.</p>
