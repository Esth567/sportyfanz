        <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/">Florida</a> offensive lineman <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26702132/devon-manuel/">Devon Manuel</a> was arrested Friday in Gainesville for allegedly driving under the influence and secondâ€‘degree felony possession of a concealed weapon, according to documents obtained by <a href="https://247sports.com/college/florida/article/florida-football-offensive-lineman-devon-manuel-arrested-for-dui-weapon-charge-251877978/" target="_blank">Swamp247</a>. The 22-year-old redshirt senior was booked into Alachua County Jail and later released on bond.</p><p>Manuel was stopped shortly after midnight for driving 60 mph in a 45 mph zone, per the report. Officers reported smelling marijuana in the vehicle and said Manuel admitted to using a THC vape cartridge prior to driving. He also reportedly told police he did not possess a medical marijuana card.</p><p>The report states that Manuel, the only occupant in the vehicle, informed officers there was a firearm located between the driver's seat and the center console. A Glock 20 pistol loaded with 14 rounds -- but without a round chambered -- was later found during a search of the car, according to police.</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-footballs-most-intimidating-stadiums-lsu-penn-state-could-break-noise-records-in-2025-season/" target="_blank">

<p>Officers also conducted a field sobriety test, which they say Manuel performed poorly. He reportedly explained to police that a prior meniscus injury in his right knee made it difficult to balance during the exam. A breathalyzer test registered a blood alcohol content of 0.000. Police collected a urine sample for additional toxicology testing.</p>
        

<p>Manuel has not been formally charged in connection with the incident as of Friday evening.</p><p>Florida's athletics department acknowledged the incident in a brief statement to Swamp247: "We are aware of the situation with Devon Manuel. We will gather all the facts and monitor the situation."</p>
        

<p>Manuel appeared in three games last season primarily as a reserve for Florida after transferring from <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/">Arkansas</a>, where he appeared in 10 games with four starts in three seasons.</p>
