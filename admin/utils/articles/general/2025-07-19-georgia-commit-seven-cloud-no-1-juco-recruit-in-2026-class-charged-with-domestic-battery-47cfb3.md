        <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/">Georgia</a> football commit Seven Cloud, the top junior college prospect in the 2026 recruiting class, was charged with domestic battery in Butler County, Kansas, <a href="https://www.butlercountytimesgazette.com/2025/07/seven-cloud-facing-domestic-battery-charges/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to the Butler County Times-Gazette</a>. The Butler Community College All-American defensive tackle appeared via Zoom before a judge on July 14, where he was charged with a Class B misdemeanor.&nbsp;</p><p>The charge stems from an April 20 incident in which the Butler County Sheriff's Office responded to a report involving Cloud and his significant other. Authorities allege Cloud "knowingly caused physical contact with another person in a rude, angry or insulting manner," involving someone with whom he had a dating or household relationship.</p><p>During the hearing, the judge found probable cause and ordered Cloud to have no contact with the alleged victim. He is scheduled to return to court on Sept. 22.</p><p>Cloud is also facing separate misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct (brawling or fighting) and criminal damage to property related to a March 27 incident in which he allegedly destroyed the victim's cell phone. These charges, filed on Thursday, are designated as domestic violence offenses, and a court date has not yet been set.</p>
