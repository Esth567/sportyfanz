This support will drive the sport on to new heights."</p><p>Josh Kerr, 1500m world champion and double Olympic medallist, said: "London 2017 was my first senior World Championships and it lit a fire in me.</p><p>"I'm proud to support the bid and hope we get the chance to show the world what we can do on home soil."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="London-has-got-a-good-chance-of-winning-it" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'London has got a good chance of winning it'</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p><i>Steve Cram, former British athlete and BBC Sport commentator</i></p><p>I think it would be huge and I'm so pleased that this has happened. There has been a little bit of angst as to whether the government were going to back the bid for 2029 and the clock was ticking on that, so it's great that they've decided to do that.</p><p>The idea of the London Stadium was that it gets used for major championships. We can't use it every year for a Champs but it's been 12 years since we had a Championships back here. It would be phenomenal.</p><p>Athletics needs venues where you put 60,000 people in for each session and we know London can do that so we've got a great chance with the government backing.</p><p>It's kind of due to come back to Europe so London - which is very accessible for the whole of Europe - has got a good chance of winning it.</p><p>For both the World Athletics Championships and the Para Championships, it's a great opportunity. Government backing gives us a great chance of delivering it so fingers crossed.</p></div></article></div>
