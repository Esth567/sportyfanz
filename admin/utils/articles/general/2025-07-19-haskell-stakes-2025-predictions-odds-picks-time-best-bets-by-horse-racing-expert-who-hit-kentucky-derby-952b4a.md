        <p>Bob Baffert will look to add another win to his resume at the 2025 Haskell Stakes on Saturday. The legendary trainer has won this race a record nine times, and Triple Crown competitor Goal Oriented could give him his 10th Haskell Stakes victory at Monmouth Park this weekend. Goal Oriented is listed at 4-1 odds in the 2025 Haskell Stakes field, while Preakness Stakes winner Journalism is ahead of him as the 4-5 favorite in the 2025 Haskell Stakes odds. Gosger (9-2), Burnham Square (5-1) and Bracket Buster (10-1) round out the top five at the 2025 Haskell Stakes, which has a post time of 5:45 p.m. ET. The race is expected to have a fast track due to favorable weather conditions in Oceanport, N.J.&nbsp;</p><p>With eight seasoned horses set to enter the starting gate on Saturday, you'll want to <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-haskell-stakes-picks-odds-horse-racing-writer-has-best-bets-for-saturdays-race/#ttag=07182025_agg_cbssports_picks_horseracing_Menez_HaskellStakesMenez2025" target="_blank">see what SportsLine horse racing expert Gene Menez has to say before making any 2025 Haskell Stakes picks or horse racing predictions.</a></p><p>A former reporter and editor at Sports Illustrated, Menez covered an array of sports, including horse racing, for the magazine and its website for almost 14 years. Between 2010 and 2012, he served as SI's handicapper for the Triple Crown races and correctly predicted Super Saver to win the Kentucky Derby in 2010.</p><p>In May of last year, Menez nailed 18-1 Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby. In November, he crushed the late Pick 4 on Breeders' Cup Saturday for a $5,303 jackpot. This year, he hit the winner and exacta in the Holy Bull Stakes and the winner, trifecta and superfecta in the Florida Derby.

<h2>Top 2025 Haskell Stakes predictions</h2><p>One of Menez's surprising Haskell Stakes 2025 picks: He is fading Journalism, even though he is the 4-5 betting favorite in the 2025 Haskell Stakes odds. Journalism has five wins in eight career starts, and three wins in five starts in 2025. His only starts without first-place finishes were when he was runner up to Sovereignty at the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes. Menez acknowledges Journalism's stellar season, but is concerned about his short odds given his workload this year.</p><p>"This has already been a lengthy campaign for Journalism, who will be making his sixth start since March 1," Menez told SportsLine.
