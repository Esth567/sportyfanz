Cockcroft: </strong>With the news Thursday that Rice has been sentenced to five years of probation and 30 days of jail time as part of a plea agreement stemming from his role in a 2024 multicar crash in Dallas, the odds of him serving a multigame suspension have significantly increased. Fantasy managers should brace for the likelihood Rice will miss a noticeable portion of the 2025 season.</p><p>This had long been a possibility, with the NFL choosing to wait to rule until the legal process played itself out, but now that Rice's penalty has been handed out, the league is sure to move quickly to announce a potential suspension.</p><p>I've moved Rice down in my rankings, from 21st among wide receivers to 28th, between <a data-player-guid="774cc71b-e83e-340d-bcda-4a8558265bb5" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431299/rome-odunze">Rome Odunze</a> and <a data-player-guid="a86b2e46-69f6-f60b-3017-063d68c54345" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426388/jameson-williams">Jameson Williams</a>, reflecting a probable absence. That could change depending upon the length of any penalty. <a data-player-guid="36240080-be64-3e8a-a33d-8defd9119656" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4683062/xavier-worthy">Xavier Worthy</a> has also moved up from 23rd to 21st.</p><p>However, remember that Rice delivered some of the best per-game fantasy production when available for games, from Week 7 of the 2023 season, his first career NFL start, through Week 3 of 2024, his final full game before getting hurt last year. Including the postseason, he had team bests of 140 targets, a 23.0% target share, 28.2% target rate per route and 108 receptions during that span. Rice averaged 16.4 PPR fantasy points across those 17 games, which, when contrasted against the 2024 wide receiver leaderboard, would've placed him 15th.</p><h2>July 17: <a data-player-guid="915d218e-ce3f-2f83-c976-23132144d788" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045138/mike-williams">Mike Williams</a> announces retirement from the NFL</h2><p>After eight years, <a data-clubhouse-guid="84caf62b-c753-71ea-a787-44fd224a4294" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a> wide receiver Mike Williams has retired from the NFL, the team announced Thursday.</p><p>Williams, 30, played his last season in the league with the Jets and Steelers before signing a one-year deal this offseason to return to the Chargers, the organization that drafted him in the first round in 2017.

Harris is currently holding out of training camp as part of several unsigned second-round rookies across the NFL. Our 2025 fantasy football rankings have been updated to reflect this news, including <a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections">projections</a> for all Chargers' players.</p><h2>June 30: What trade to Steelers means for TE <a data-player-guid="58017d3f-d9dd-7db8-4494-a5d6f7d63b9c" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054212/jonnu-smith">Jonnu Smith</a>'s value</h2><p><strong>Tristan H. Cockcroft:</strong> Smith was one of 2024's biggest breakthrough players, pacing all tight ends in PPR fantasy points following the <a data-clubhouse-guid="af33088b-1e19-d27d-dbc0-354fd7151703" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>' Week 6 bye. He was heavily targeted in the red zone during that time, seeing 17 in 12 games, so some regression, particularly in the touchdown department, was inevitable. Considering Smith is now reunited with Arthur Smith, under whom he finished 48th (2017), 35th (2018), 20th (2019), 17th (2020) and 17th (2023) in scoring at his position in five of his eight NFL seasons, those concerns only heighten. The <a data-clubhouse-guid="debcd592-8d53-71f1-fc15-5c8b8ef9df6e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> also have <a data-player-guid="dd0c7d09-aed2-e7dd-defd-12de97619e6e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361411/pat-freiermuth">Pat Freiermuth</a> to soak up some targets at the position.</p><p>That said, Smith is expected to serve in a hybrid tight end/slot receiver/fullback role with his new team, creative usage that should at least keep him on the position's top-10 radar, albeit barely. Much of his fantasy production will hinge on how effectively <a data-player-guid="5fbab03e-2816-55ab-ae10-83b132803d9e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a> rebounds from his disappointing 2024. Smith's arrival renders Freiermuth a near afterthought in all but the deepest (read: 16-plus team) leagues.</p><h2>June 10: How the Dobbins signing impacts Broncos' backfield</h2><p><strong>Matt Bowen:</strong> The <a data-clubhouse-guid="51042145-e3c1-0694-ae0d-f720342ff8fc" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a> signed free agent running back <a data-player-guid="249571a5-6db7-2705-2aa0-10c3bca5b417" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241985/jk-dobbins">J.K. Dobbins</a> to a one-year contract Tuesday. Dobbins had 1,058 total yards and nine touchdown last season for the <a data-clubhouse-guid="84caf62b-c753-71ea-a787-44fd224a4294" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a>, while averaging 14.4 PPG in 13 games played. So, let's quickly discuss the fantasy impact of the veteran's arrival in the Broncos' running back room.</p><p>Rookie <a data-player-guid="bef79e03-5c24-4c6f-a1da-d3f18d34880d" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4568490/rj-harvey">RJ Harvey</a> should be expected to maintain his role as the lead runner in Sean Payton's offense, which includes the designed targets in the pass game. Harvey has the traits to be deployed as a dual-threat back in this system. However, Dobbins will take some carries away from Harvey, and his physical running style could lead to more work on the goal line. Because of that, Harvey will drop down some slots in my preseason rankings, but he remains a solid RB2/Flex.</p><p>Yes, Dobbins does have an injury history, playing in just 37 games over his first four seasons as a pro. That must be mentioned here. But if Dobbins can stay healthy, he fits as a No. 2 in this offense, which would diminish the roles of <a data-player-guid="68a0f5f2-bb16-314e-af01-398fd4027a48" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569682/audric-estime">Audric Estime</a> and <a data-player-guid="ee54ff50-5e40-3bd7-a534-9f6ef4ff7c9a" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4722893/jaleel-mclaughlin">Jaleel McLaughlin</a> in 2025.</p><hr><h2>June 5: What Aaron Rodgers to the Steelers means for fantasy</h2><p><strong>Matt Bowen:</strong> <a data-player-guid="5fbab03e-2816-55ab-ae10-83b132803d9e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a> plans to sign with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="debcd592-8d53-71f1-fc15-5c8b8ef9df6e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Thursday.</p><p>Rodgers, who will turn 42 during the 2025 season, threw for 3,897 yards, 29 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions last year as a member of the <a data-clubhouse-guid="732d3caf-b350-1e34-48c6-b7cebb4a0d88" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a>, who, coincidentally, will host the Steelers in Week 1. <a data-player-guid="7e9fbd60-951e-2d9a-8d8c-b3f1ab6c4a4d" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields">Justin Fields</a>, who started the first six games for Pittsburgh last season, is now the presumed starter for the Jets.</p><p>In terms of Rodgers' fantasy impact, we had already been <a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections">projecting his stats</a> based on him joining the Steelers.</p><p>So let's discuss the veteran quarterback's skill set at this stage of his career and what it means on the fantasy front for the Pittsburgh offense.</p><p>Based on the tape I've watched, the arm talent still pops with Rodgers, as do the quick release and accelerated field vision. He can get the ball out and identify post-snap coverage rotations with ease. Yes, the mobility and pocket poise have declined, which does limit his opportunities to create outside of structure at a higher rate, but in a run-oriented offense, one that will also use play-action elements to keep the pocket firm, Rodgers can function and produce in Arthur Smith's system.</p><p>With Rodgers' arrival, <a data-player-guid="c6727be7-1ac0-315c-437d-e281fe9a2e84" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047650/dk-metcalf">DK Metcalf</a>'s fantasy value gets a slight boost from where it had been before the QB's arrival. Metcalf has the field-stretching ability to run the outside verticals and deep in-breakers, plus he will be a top quick-gain target for Rodgers on slants, unders and screens. That puts Metcalf in the WR2/Flex range heading into the 2025 fantasy season, while <a data-player-guid="dd0c7d09-aed2-e7dd-defd-12de97619e6e" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361411/pat-freiermuth">Pat Freiermuth</a> remains a midtier TE2 with potential streaming upside who can be viewed as a big body option in the middle of the field.</p><p>Remember, Rodgers averaged 15.1 PPG with both <a data-player-guid="da106063-995d-eaf0-54e4-ccecd5e90767" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson">Garrett Wilson</a> and <a data-player-guid="d287bc03-47c2-c7f6-6160-e4280c80d2e2" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16800/davante-adams">Davante Adams</a> as his top targets last season in New York. And in a Steelers offense that will use the run game as a foundational piece, Rodgers fits best as a QB2 who can be started in 2QB Superflex formats or as a matchup-based streaming option.</p>
