The champions remain in talks over a fee for Ekitike, who is understood to have a €100m (£87m) release clause in his Eintracht contract, with a deal expected to be completed next week. Germany’s Sky Sport reported on Saturday night that a second written bid had been submitted.</p><p>Howe admitted Newcastle are “desperate” to keep Isak, who has three years remaining on his contract, but added he could not give “100% clarity” on any player’s future.</p><p>The Newcastle manager said of the striker’s absence in Glasgow: “It was my decision. He travelled back to Glasgow with us but I decided to send him home due to the speculation around him. The last thing he wanted is to be sat in the stand watching, that wasn’t fair to him. But I’m confident he will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window.”</p><p>Howe, who also omitted Joelinton against the Scottish champions, added: “It’s difficult for me to give 100% clarity on any player. Alex is happy at Newcastle, he loves the players, the staff, the team. I’m confident he’ll be here at the start of the season. Yes, I’ve had discussions with him but that’s not abnormal. I respect a player’s career and how short it is. Alex has been really good, he’s trained really well and I realise there’ll be noise around him.”</p><p>Liverpool’s decision to go for Ekitike, who made it clear he favoured a move to Anfield over St James’ Park before Newcastle pulled out of the race for the striker, represents another frustration in what has been a problematic transfer window for Howe.</p><p>Newcastle have also missed out on João Pedro, Bryan Mbeumo and Liam Delap while their long-running pursuit of Burnley’s £40m-rated goalkeeper James Trafford is now in doubt with Manchester City linked with their former player.</p><p>Howe and his nephew, Andy Howe, have been overseeing much of Newcastle’s recruitment this summer, with Paul Mitchell having left as sporting director and Darren Eales due to depart on health grounds. They have completed only one signing so far, the £55m purchase of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“We’ve had a frustrating time in missing out on targets, I’ll be open on that,” said the Newcastle manager. “But we’re confident we can get in some players who can strengthen the team.
