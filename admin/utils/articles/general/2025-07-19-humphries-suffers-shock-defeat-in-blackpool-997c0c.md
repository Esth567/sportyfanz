"He is a great champion and a great guy.</p><p>"At 6-6 and 7-7, I felt the pressure but I was happy I could keep up. Luke missed some chances but I took mine and it means so much."</p><p>Van Veen's reward is a meeting with compatriot Danny Noppert, who had a comfortable 10-2 win over Scottish debutant Cameron Menzies.</p><p>Earlier, former champion James Wade came through 10-3 against Joe Cullen.</p></div></article></main></div></div>
