The relationship has since developed into something akin to a mentor and a mentee. So, after triumphing over a strong field at the London Stadium in 1min 56.74sec – the second-fastest time of her life – Hunter Bell is keen to hear what Holmes thinks of it all.</p><figure id="05a9ee4a-a9bc-4636-b0e0-0e872e3d97db" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:6,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;World Athletics Championships: London’s 2029 bid gets Starmer backing&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;05a9ee4a-a9bc-4636-b0e0-0e872e3d97db&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/19/london-2029-world-athletics-championships-keir-starmer-uk-government&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}"></gu-island></figure><p>“Doing the double [at the world championships] is an option because the schedule’s actually quite generous for it,” she said. “There’s proper days off; one event completes before the second starts. But I just think it’s really hard and you might stuff your chances at both. So I don’t know. A lot of people can have their opinion but there’s very few that have actually done it. I’d like to see what Kelly has to say about it.”</p><p>There is an additional factor. Shorn of her training partner, and Olympic champion, Keely Hodgkinson – who is expected to return from a hamstring injury in the coming weeks – 800m times have somewhat stagnated. By contrast, increasing numbers of 1500m women continue to break new ground.</p><p>“You’ve got to look strategically at the events,” said Hunter Bell. “The 1500m has got even faster than last year. I didn’t think that was possible, but it has again. Whereas the 800m, at the moment, is not as fast as it was last year. So if you’re trying to get a medal, what is actually the best thing to do?”</p><p>Elsewhere, the anticipated battle of the British runners failed to materialise in the men’s 1500m as the young Kenyan upstart Phanuel Koech upset the 60,000-strong sellout crowd by outkicking reigning world champion Josh Kerr in the home straight to claim victory.</p><figure id="f109d6dd-5d7b-4e36-8dcf-abd218d6c80c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Phanuel Koech runs away from Josh Kerr in the final straight to win the men’s 1500m" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356.0657959586003" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Phanuel Koech runs away from Josh Kerr in the final straight to win the men’s 1500m.</span> Photograph: Javier García/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>Koech, 18, had never run a 1500m race before last month, but now owns three of the six fastest times in the world this year after triumphing in a meeting record of 3:28.82.
