Big game players who were probably challenged by a good few."</p><p>Sione Tuipulotu, the first Scot to score a Lions Test try since Alan Tait in 1997, was of the same mind. "In big games they perform when it counts," said the centre. </p><p>"Tom was amazing, he's a joy to play with. I always look at him and he always looks so sore when he's running around, he always looks in pain but he just keeps going. Testament to him. The same with Tadhg.</p><p>"They're two warriors of the game and they were a big reason why we won. Those two are like ball magnets. Wherever the ball is, they're in and around."</p><p>There's no doubt about their seismic contribution in Brisbane. Beirne made 23 tackles, won three turnovers - one inside the opening minute - and was world class.  Curry was just like a man possessed. Driven, aggressive, almost dangerous in his intensity, in the best possible sense.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>We went to interview Curry after the match and it was quite something. He didn't say much after his colossal night, but in a sense he'd said enough already. Not words, but actions. Thunderous, relentless and unyielding.</p><p>When he entered the mixed zone after what will go down as one of his finest 58 minutes of his career - the Lions were leading 24-5 when he went off - Curry was about as effusive as a rock.</p><p>Clearly, there's a beef there. Somebody has been in his ear, maybe filling his head with stuff to anger and inspire him. 'They've written you off Tom.' 'They don't think you deserve your place.' 'What message are you gonna send them on Saturday?'</p><p>Who was doing the writing off? It actually doesn't matter. His brother Ben - currently touring with England - <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2025/07/18/ben-curry-hits-out-lions-fans-tom-criticism-twin/">lambasted the cyber warriors<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> for giving him stick that was "gobsmacking" and "incredibly disappointing".</p><p>Maybe Tom, himself, thought it was the journalists who'd been on his case. Certainly, there's been stuff said and written about him not quite being at his brilliant and belligerent best, but that's fair comment. He hasn't been. We're talking a very, very high bar here.</p><p>And, yes, there's been praise for Jac Morgan, who's had a good tour. Some observers would have had Morgan ahead of Curry. Many others would have said Curry's best stuff is other-worldly and he had to start.</p><p>Whatever was dripped into his ear, it worked. Real or invented - it doesn't matter. Curry was extraordinarily good on the pitch and spectacularly taciturn in the aftermath. Almost heroically stoic.</p><p>'How do you feel after that, Tom?'</p><p>"Yeah, good."</p><p>'Happy with your performance?'</p><p>"I was happy."</p><p>'Big hit [on James Slipper] at the startâ€¦</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>'Atmosphere was amazing, eh?'</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>'Anything else on that, Tom?'</p><p>"It was good."</p><p>'How close do you think that was to a world-class performance?'</p><p>"I don't know what world class is. It's such a cliched thing, isn't it? I don't really care what label you put on it - you just have to win."</p><p>'How much more do you think you've got in you for next week?'</p><p>"Loads."</p><p>'In what areas?'</p><p>"Every area."</p><p>'That was your type of game, wasn't it?'</p><p>"They're all my types of game."</p><p>'I don't know if you picked up on any criticism that maybe you weren't in peak form coming into this. Did you pick up on any of that?</p><p>"No, nothing."</p><p>On it went, an occasional answer longer than a word or two, but not many, all delivered with a smile that hinted at something he wanted to say but wasn't going to. Because, again, he'd said everything he needed to say in his time on the field.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Whoever he thought had doubted him, he'd answered them. Curry is a hard man and a phenomenal rugby player. He drove into the guts of the Wallabies from the opening seconds at the Suncorp and delivered that moment that sent the Lions on their way.</p><p>In burying Slipper in the tackle and setting up Beirne to win a turnover penalty, a tone was set. Farrell referenced that later on. They were monstrously physical and the third member of that back row, Jack Conan, was right up there with them.</p><p>Curry went looking for victims, smashing Max Jorgensen, nailing Fraser McReight, taking out Tom Lynagh in the air and giving away a penalty -  a touch lucky not to get a yellow card - but Joe Schmidt had no major issue with it afterwards.</p><p>He scored a try as well, of course. After he left, the bottom started to fall out of the Lions performance. Was it complacency? Farrell said no. Was it a subconscious belief that the game had already been won when the Lions went 24-5 ahead early in the second half? Maro Itoje denied that.</p><p>It was just a drop-off in discipline, some bad decisions. "That shouldn't happen," said Farrell. "We talk about next-moment-focused at all times and that certainly shouldn't happen. We certainly need to address it. Subconsciously, I guess that tends to happen, not that it should."</p><p>Not that Itoje agreed with the subconscious point. "I don't think so," he replied when asked about the switch-off at 24-5. "I think we were a bit inaccurate with our decision-making and when you're not accurate with your decision-making against a good team you tend to put yourself under pressure. I think that's what happened in the second half."</p><p>That and Curry exiting the stage when the Lions were threatening to run amok and trouble the record books.</p><p>On this supposed criticism of Curry, you wonder if Farrell played on that. You wonder if he brought Curry and Beirne together and played with their minds a little, maybe exaggerated the extent of the barbs, maybe asked a question or two of them.</p><p>"I wouldn't say they took it to heart," said Farrell. "We have conversations on 'why do you think you're selected?' and 'what is it that you're going to bring to the team performance?' and to a man they're unbelievably honest. They're men of their word."</p><p>Meaning that whatever it was they told their coach they would produce they duly produced. Beirne spoke brilliantly later on. He covered all sorts of areas and delved into different issues with excellent perspectives. Curry went down a different road. It takes all sorts. He was stoic in the mixed zone but fantastically fluent in the language of Test match rugby.</p><p>Long may his critics - whoever and wherever they are - take potshots at him, because the put-downs make him rise up. Another display like this and he might well cement his place in Lions history in Melbourne next Saturday - and the disapproving voices, if they exist at all, will be silent at last.</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>More to come from Lions after opening win - Farrell</p></figcaption></figure></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p><ul role="list"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>
