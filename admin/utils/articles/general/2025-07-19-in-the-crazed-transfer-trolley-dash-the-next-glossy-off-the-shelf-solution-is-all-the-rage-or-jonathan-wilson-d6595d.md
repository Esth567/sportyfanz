And players are human. Sometimes they struggle to deal with change: new teammates, a new manager, a new environment. No transfer is ever without at least some risk; nothing is ever guaranteed.</p><p>Still, the early moves in the market are revealing, if not necessarily for what they may mean for how the title contenders may play next season, then at least for what they say about the state of those clubs and their perceived priorities.</p><p>Getting your transfer business done early is one of the supposed markers of a decisive side that knows its own mind, which is good news for the four teams likely to be Premier League contenders – and rather less good news for Manchester United, who have moved to sign <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/matheus-cunha-signs-manchester-united-dream" data-link-name="in body link">Matheus Cunha</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/18/manchester-united-agree-deal-bryan-mbeumo-brentford-initial-65m" data-link-name="in body link">Bryan Mbeumo</a>, while struggling to offload any of the half dozen players who are surplus to requirements.</p><p>The best time to build, the ancient wisdom has it, is from a position of strength, and Liverpool have done that, bringing in a pair of full-backs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/20/florian-wirtz-liverpool-bayer-leverkusen-club-record-116m-deal" data-link-name="in body link">and Florian Wirtz</a> at a total cost of around £165m. With Trent Alexander-Arnold gone and Andy Robertson now 31, the acquisitions of Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez are straightforward enough replacements and suggest the policy of attacking full-backs will remain.</p><figure id="5568d5ab-df26-4afc-bc40-152fbcafbd4d" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e3a0460ff7be04af0ee2e1ad799dead9b980ba/195_164_3659_2608/master/3659.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e3a0460ff7be04af0ee2e1ad799dead9b980ba/195_164_3659_2608/master/3659.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e3a0460ff7be04af0ee2e1ad799dead9b980ba/195_164_3659_2608/master/3659.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e3a0460ff7be04af0ee2e1ad799dead9b980ba/195_164_3659_2608/master/3659.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e3a0460ff7be04af0ee2e1ad799dead9b980ba/195_164_3659_2608/master/3659.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e3a0460ff7be04af0ee2e1ad799dead9b980ba/195_164_3659_2608/master/3659.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Florian Wirtz, Dominik Szoboszlai, Jeremie Frimpong in Liverpool training" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e3a0460ff7be04af0ee2e1ad799dead9b980ba/195_164_3659_2608/master/3659.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="317.1795572560809" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Could the arrival of Florian Wirtz (left) mean a change in position for Dominik Szoboszlai (centre) at Liverpool?</span> Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Liverpool FC/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Wirtz is a more complicated case, in part because of his versatility. He could operate as a false 9, or on either flank, but the likelihood is he will be used as a central attacking midfielder as part of a shift to more of a 4-2-3-1 shape than the hybrid 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Liverpool</a> tended to use last season. That would mean either Dominik Szoboszlai plays less or that he is used deeper at times to add creativity against opponents who sit in a low block.</p><p>Given Arne Slot’s lack of faith in Darwin Núñez, a move for a centre-forward was always likely. Exactly what game of bluff and counter-bluff – if any – was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/newcastle-eddie-howe-alexander-isak-hugo-ekitike-liverpool" data-link-name="in body link">being played around Alexander Isak</a> remains unclear but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/liverpool-make-approach-eintracht-frankfurt-forward-hugo-ekitike" data-link-name="in body link">Hugo Ekitike is now the prime target</a>, a mobile goalscorer who should improve Liverpool’s options playing in transition even if concerns remain about his effectiveness when he doesn’t have space to run into.</p><p>While there has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/15/liverpool-luis-diaz-reject-bayern-munich-bid-not-for-sale" data-link-name="in body link">interest in Luis Díaz from Bayern</a>, Liverpool’s position on profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) is healthy enough that there is no need to sell the Colombian. Perming three or four from Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo, Harvey Elliott, Wirtz, Díaz and Isak or Ekitike marks a significant upgrade on last season.</p><p>For Arsenal, after becoming the fifth club to finish as runners-up three years running, there is a sense of urgency. If not now, then when? How many more chances will this side have before the rump needs refreshing? That perhaps explains their targets.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/10/arsenal-complete-9m-christian-norgaard-signing-and-step-up-eberechi-eze-chase" data-link-name="in body link">Christian Nørgaard</a> is not especially eye-catching but adds useful defensive depth. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/martin-zubimendi-arsenal-what-he-will-bring-real-soceidad-spain-midfielder" data-link-name="in body link">Martín Zubimendi</a> should have the tactical intelligence to protect the back four and so release Declan Rice.

Benjamin Sesko had been the long-term target before Arsenal turned their attention to the older and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/arsenal-agree-635m-viktor-gyokeres-deal-with-sporting-with-add-ons-still-being-discussed" data-link-name="in body link">slightly cheaper Viktor Gyökeres</a>. Given Arsenal almost certainly do need a high-class centre-forward, saving £10m-£15m for a player five years older about whom doubts remain about his capacity to get shots away in tight spaces seems a questionable economy.</p><p>Manchester City’s transition continues apace, with the arrival of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/15/rayan-cherki-targets-revenge-on-manchester-united-as-he-begins-city-adventure" data-link-name="in body link">Rayan Cherki</a>, Tijjani Reijnders and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/09/incredibly-happy-rayan-ait-nouri-seals-31m-move-to-manchester-city" data-link-name="in body link">Rayan Aït-Nouri</a> to go with the four players they signed in January.

But the feeling is all a little like 2016 after Leicester won the league and Southampton and West Ham finished in the top seven, when the elite went on a spree to reaffirm their status. Eventually, money always wins.</p></div></div>
