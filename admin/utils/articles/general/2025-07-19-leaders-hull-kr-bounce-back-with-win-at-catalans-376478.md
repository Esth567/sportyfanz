The first spotted Broadbent had knocked on before freeing Lewis and the second noticed the stand-off had dropped the ball as he touched down.</p><p>The league leaders made sure in the second half.</p><p>Burgess raced clear from a pass by Broadbent, who grabbed his second from another slick Lewis pass.</p><p>Catalans found some relief as Alrix da Costa's kick was pounced on by Navarrete, but the French side fell apart in the closing stages, with two wayward Cesar Rouge passes gifting tries to their opponents.</p><p>Lewis capitalised on the first, kicking the ball ahead and sprinting away to make it 17 tries for the season, and Burgess picked up the other to round off a win that keeps the Robins favourites to win the League Leaders Shield.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Catalans:</b> Aispuro-Bichet, Makinson, Romano, Darrelatour, C.
