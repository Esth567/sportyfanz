I put so much into this week that, yeah, it's hard to take.</p><p>"The annoying thing for me today is I didn't get to enjoy today as much as I would have liked - Saturday at The Open in your home country, I should enjoy it a lot more than I did, just because of how I felt."</p><p>Lowry, who said he "was not too keen" to discuss the penalty incident for a second time, birdied the 13th on Saturday to get back to level par for the championship but followed that with a quadruple bogey on the next hole and dropped a further shot at the 17th.</p><p>He said his illness contributed to a "lack of energy" in the closing stretch of holes.</p><p>"Honestly, every bathroom I went in and tried to throw up, I couldn't," he added.</p><p>"It's just such a bad feeling. I think lack of energy towards the end maybe did me in.</p><p>"Look, I don't want to make excuses. It is what it is. It's just really bad timing, obviously."</p></div></article></main></div></div>
