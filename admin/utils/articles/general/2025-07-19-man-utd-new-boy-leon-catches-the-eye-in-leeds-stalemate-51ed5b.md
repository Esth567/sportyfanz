A short pass to Chido Obi inside the penalty area was delivered with a delicate touch you would not normally expect of someone Leon's size.</p><p>Goodness knows what he was like as a schoolboy in South America but he is already a solid unit.</p><p>That might bring its own problems as he gets accustomed to the intensity of the Premier League and, even in this encounter, played in pleasant conditions despite the sun and mid-afternoon kick-off, Leon seemed to be catching his breath on a couple of occasions.</p><p>Initially, he was caught out by overlapping runs from Willy Gnonto and Jayden Bogle. But he quickly worked out when danger might present itself and, with a bit of coaching from Luke Shaw, who was playing inside him as the left-sided central defender, he was not exposed in the same manner again.</p><p>After Casemiro's deflected shot had bounced back off the top of the crossbar, Leon was confident enough to try and convert the rebound even though the angle was virtually impossible.</p><p>It was no surprise he failed but the attitude bodes well for the future.</p><p>Along with the rest of Amorim's starting line-up, the teenager was replaced at half-time in readiness for the three-match trip to the United States to play in the Premier League Summer Series.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Manchester United playmaker Matheus Cunha dribbles between Leeds duo Ao Tanaka and Willy Gnonto" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/1bcc/live/d58eac70-64b9-11f0-9881-954771c01d18.jpg 976w" width="1024" height="576"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Matheus Cunha wore the number 10 shirt and played in an attacking midfield role against Leeds</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Heaton-and-Meslier-ensure-goalless-game" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Heaton and Meslier ensure goalless game</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Having praised one of the youngest players in United's squad, they had the oldest to thank for keeping Leeds out.</p><p>Veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly2w3e4nj1o">signed a one-year contract extension</a> three weeks ago and, with Andre Onana injured, the 39-year-old is pushing Altay Bayindir for the interim first-choice role.</p><p>And he caught the eye with three excellent second-half saves.</p><p>Largie Ramazani was denied twice but the best was the first after Joel Piroe had set up Bogle.</p><p>Interestingly for Leeds, while striker Patrick Bamford did not make the trip – and no explanation was offered before kick-off – Jack Harrison, who has spent the last two season on loan at Everton and is expected to move again, started.</p><p>Jaka Bijol and Lukas Nmecha were also given first starts by boss Daniel Farke, while fellow new signings Gabriel Gudmundsson, Sean Longstaff and Sebastiaan Bornauw came on after half-time - with actor Will Ferrell, an investor in Leeds, watching on from the stands.</p><p>As news filtered through of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgjgq5703leo">Leeds having a £17m bid accepted</a> by German club Hoffenheim for their midfielder Anton Stach, it is clear Farke, like Amorim, can expect plenty of improvement from his side before their return to the top flight against Everton on 18 August.</p><p>Manchester United finished on top.
