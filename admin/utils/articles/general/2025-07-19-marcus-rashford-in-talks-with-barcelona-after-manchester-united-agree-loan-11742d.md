Kick off at the Strawberry Arena was delayed by 10 minutes because of heavy traffic outside the stadium. Matheus Cunha made his United debut following his £62.5m arrival from Wolves and played the opening 45 minutes before Amorim made 11 changes at the interval.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Amorim says Cunha showed what United have been missing. “I think Matheus Cunha showed what we need - that is the player when he receives the ball between the lines can be really aggressive in direction of the opponent. We watched that during last season in a different team, so we expect the same thing. Of course, you can see that the connection between him and Bruno [Fernandes] is still not there, but it’s going to be a good connection.”</p><p>United head to the United States next week for the Premier League Summer Series against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton and hope to include Bryan Mbeumo in their travelling party. Old Trafford officials agreed a deal that could rise to £71m on Friday for the Brentford forward, who underwent his United medical on Saturday.</p><p>After the game in Stockholm, Daniel Farke confirmed that he had told Patrick Bamford that the striker was not going to be involved in Leeds’ Premier League campaign, because of his fitness problems over the past couple of years. The Leeds manager said: “Patrick knows how much I value him as a player, I have spoken several times about this, and that I would have preferred a completely fit Patrick Bamford, in the last two seasons. He also knows how much I rate him as a person, but I thought it was my duty to have a very open and honest conversation with him right now, straight away with him.</p><p>“The second day of pre-season I got him into my office and told him that he was not in my plans for the upcoming Premier League season, just in the fact that he had really difficult years in the last years.”</p></div></div>
