He picked it up and held it out in front of him, looking confused.</p><p>"I have another golf ball," he said with a smile to those around him.</p><p>McIlroy then laughed it off and tossed the mystery ball into a nearby bush. NBC Sports commentator and former caddie John Wood said a stunned McIlroy asked him if he had ever seen anything like it.</p><p>His shot wound up being a poor one, not even reaching the green, and he couldn't get up and down for par. The bogey -- the first of his round -- dropped him to 2 under for the day and 5 under for the tournament at Royal Portrush.</p><p>He rebounded from the bizarre moment with an eagle at No. 12 that drew a roar from the crowd.</p><p>McIlroy birdied three of his first four holes then settled for all pars until the surprising moment on the 11th.</p><p><em>The Associated Press and Field Level Media contributed to this report.</em></p>
