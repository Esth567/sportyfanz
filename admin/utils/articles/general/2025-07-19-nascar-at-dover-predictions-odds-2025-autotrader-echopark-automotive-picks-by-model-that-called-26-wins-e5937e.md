        <p>The 2025 AutoTrader EchoPark Automotive 400 will take place on Sunday at Dover Motor Speedway and the race will also serve as the semifinals of the NASCAR In-Season Challenge, a head-to-head tournament where the highest finisher advances. There are also only six races remaining until the start of the 2025 NASCAR playoffs, so time is running out to earn one of the 16 postseason spots and the drama is escalating. Denny Hamlin has already secured a berth with three wins this season but he's still the +500 favorite in the 2025 AutoTrader EchoPark Automotive 400 odds and he's followed closely by Kyle Larson (+550) , Ryan Blaney (+750) and William Byron (+750) in the NASCAR at Dover odds.</p><p>The green flag drops at 2 p.m. ET, and the race is scheduled for 400 laps around "The Monster Mile." Before entering any 2025 AutoTrader EchoPark Automotive 400 picks, NASCAR DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, or locking in NASCAR props on sites like PrizePicks, Sleeper Fantasy and Underdog Fantasy, be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-autotrader-echopark-automotive-400-odds-picks-projected-nascar-at-dover-leaderboard-predictions-by-top-model/#ttag=07162025_agg_cbssports_picks_autoracing_nascarcupseries_model_AutoTraderEchoParkAutomotive400" target="_blank">see the latest 2025 NASCAR at Dover predictions from SportsLine's proven projection model</a>.</p><p>Developed by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, this proprietary NASCAR prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times, taking into account factors such as track history and recent results.</p><p>McClure's model began the 2025 season by calling Chase Elliott's win in the Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray for a +300 payout. Then it went on to predict Kyle Larson in Miami (+350), Christopher Bell's NASCAR All-Star Race win (+600), Denny Hamlin's win in Michigan (+650), Shane van Gisbergen's win in Mexico City (+330), Elliott's win in Atlanta (+1500) and van Gisbergen again in Chicago (+150) and Sonoma (+125).</p>
        

<p>All told, the model has nailed seven winners this year and a whopping 26 winners since 2021. Anyone who followed its lead on <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/" target="_blank">betting apps</a></span> and sportsbooks on those NASCAR picks could have seen huge returns. New users also have the opportunity to take advantage of the latest&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/bet365-promo-code/">Bet365 promo code</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/" target="_blank">DraftKings promo code</a></span> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanatics-promo-code/">Fanatics Sportsbook promo code</a>.</p><p>Now, the model simulated the 2025 AutoTrader EchoPark Automotive 400 10,000 times. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-autotrader-echopark-automotive-400-odds-picks-projected-nascar-at-dover-leaderboard-predictions-by-top-model/#ttag=07162025_agg_cbssports_picks_autoracing_nascarcupseries_model_AutoTraderEchoParkAutomotive400" target="_blank">Head to SportsLine to see the complete projected NASCAR at Dover leaderboard</a>.</p><h2>Top 2025 AutoTrader EchoPark Automotive 400 predictions</h2><p>For Sunday's 2025 AutoTrader EchoPark Automotive 400, the model is high on Joey Logano, even though he's a +2600 longshot in the latest 2025 NASCAR at Dover odds from FanDuel. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday and first-time users can also get $150 in bonus bets if their first bet wins with this <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/" target="_blank">FanDuel promo code</a></span>.</p>
        

<p>Coming off a ninth-place finish at Sonoma last week, Logano is 11th in the NASCAR standings but he's assured a spot in the 2025 NASCAR Playoffs thanks to a win and there being three other winners well behind him on points. The three-time NASCAR Cup Series champion was in a similarly fringy position last season but managed to earn his way into the postseason and then continually snuck through each round on his way to winning the title.</p><p>He's never won before at Dover, but he does have five top-five finishes and 15 top 10s in 28 career Cup starts at "The Monster Mile," so he's run well there generally. The win in Fort Worth looks like the turning point of Logano's season after a rough start and the model is predicting that he puts together another strong run on Sunday and is an inherent value at this price.</p><p>The model has also revealed a shocking NASCAR prop for Sunday: Tyler Reddick finishes top five for a +240 payout at BetMGM. He's potentially a strong value pick for your Dover NASCAR prop bets, and you can also get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses with this <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/" target="_blank">BetMGM promo code</a></span>.</p>
        

<p>Reddick doesn't have a win yet this season but he is still fourth in the NASCAR standings and has built up a 146-point cushion to qualify for the postseason on points. However, four more first-time winners this season could still knock him out of playoff position and he has additional incentive this week thanks to the NASCAR In-Season Challenge. Reddick is a semifinalist and he'll go head-to-head with Ty Gibbs on Sunday for a spot in the finals and a shot at a $1 million cash prize.</p><p>The 29-year-old has been top-six in each of his last three races and he's been dialing in at Dover Motor Speedway since joining 23XI Racing in 2023. He finished seventh at Dover that season and then finished 11th last season, and he looks primed to contend for a victory this year given the circumstances.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-autotrader-echopark-automotive-400-odds-picks-projected-nascar-at-dover-leaderboard-predictions-by-top-model/#ttag=07162025_agg_cbssports_picks_autoracing_nascarcupseries_model_AutoTraderEchoParkAutomotive400" target="_blank">See which other drivers to avoid and the rest of the projected NASCAR leaderboard at SportsLine</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 NASCAR at Dover picks</h2><p>The model is also targeting three&nbsp; other drivers with Dover NASCAR odds of 14-1 or longer to make a serious run at the checkered flag.
