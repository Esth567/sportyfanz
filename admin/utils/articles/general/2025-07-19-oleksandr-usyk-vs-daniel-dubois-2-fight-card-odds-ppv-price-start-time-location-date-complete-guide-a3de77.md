        <p>Come Saturday, the world will once again have an undisputed heavyweight champion. WBA, WBO and WBC champion Oleksandr Usyk is set to rematch IBF champion Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium in London.</p><p>Usyk, then the WBO, WBA and IBF champion, won their August 2023 meeting by knockout in Round 9, though the win didn't come without some controversy. Dubois dropped Usyk with a shot to the body that was -- correctly -- ruled a low blow. Dubois and his team have insisted the referee's call was wrong and that they were thus cheated out of a pivotal moment in a huge fight.</p><p>The first win over Dubois set Usyk up to face then-WBC champ Tyson Fury to crown an undisputed champion. Dubois took a split decision in that fight to become a four-belt champion.</p><p>The IBF's mandatory challenger rules meant that Usyk moving forward with his contractually mandated rematch with Fury led to Usyk being stripped of their title.</p>

<p>Dubois was the beneficiary of this move by the IBF, picking up the interim title with a June 2024 stoppage of Filip Hrgovic and then being elevated to full champion after Usyk was stripped. Dubois then defended his title with a spectacular knockout of Anthony Joshua in Wembley Stadium.</p><p>The belt put Dubois in position for a rematch with Usyk, this time with the prize of an undisputed championship on the line.&nbsp;</p><p>"I prepared right and I'm just on a different level now," Dubois said at Wednesday's final press conference. "I'm ready to go through whatever I need to on Saturday to get all of them belts. I am chasing glory and I am chasing greatness.</p>
        

<p>"I'm switched on and focused. I'm ready to cause chaos in that ring, I'm ready to go."</p><p>The undercard features a distinct English flair with many from England represented on Saturday. Most interesting may be another heavyweight showdown between Lawrence Okolie and Kevin Lerena. Okolie made the move up to heavyweight after previously holding the WBO cruiserweight title and three successful title defenses. But a loss to Chris Billam-Smith spurred a move up in weight. First, to the recently formed bridgerweight, where he defeated Lukasz Rozanski. One fight later, he earned a secondary title at heavyweight against Hussein Muhamed last December. He takes on Lerena, who has bounced between bridgerweight and heavyweight in his last five fights, scoring a knockout of Serihy Radchenko in May to retain his title.</p><p>"I've looked at it [Dubois vs Lerena], but I'm not looking to make a statement in that way, I just want to put on the best performance I can on Saturday," Okolie said ahead of the Lerena fight. "I've had a lot more experience with southpaws than Dan. I plan on delivering another first-round knockout."&nbsp;</p>
