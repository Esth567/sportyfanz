He won't pitch for at least a week. Rodriguez was initially sidelined with a sore elbow, but then injured his lat, delaying his return.

A mild 71 degrees with wind blowing slightly in could help keep a pair of potent lineups in check. A handful of the nighttime affairs may be a little wet, but the only game in jeopardy is the <a data-clubhouse-guid="a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals">Washington Nationals</a> hosting the <a data-clubhouse-guid="4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres">San Diego Padres</a> at 6:45 p.m. ET.</p><ul><li><p>The anticipation is that <a data-player-guid="1a1ec65f-a81f-8ce9-9f38-7275b93a2474" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez">Eugenio Suarez</a> will be able to play today after being hit in the hand during the All-Star game.

He incurred a Grade 1 left hamstring strain last Sunday. Frelick is quietly posting a solid season, batting .294/.354/.414 with 17 steals, which checks in at No. 21 among outfielders on the <a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/baseball/playerrater">ESPN Player Rater</a>.</p></li><li><p>The Red Sox indicated that <a data-player-guid="e6c4099e-80c4-3ee3-8cf9-dc4fc0a06b1c" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4987382/ceddanne-rafaela">Ceddanne Rafaela</a> will play some games at second base going forward, allowing them to go with <a data-player-guid="e2897bf5-e89b-aaca-a7de-7e5dc498352a" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41610/jarren-duran">Jarren Duran</a>, <a data-player-guid="4f21b684-60dc-336d-a11c-c5c765387ebd" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080767/roman-anthony">Roman Anthony</a> and <a data-player-guid="c01c2305-33d5-3753-8529-79086533e04d" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4990055/wilyer-abreu">Wilyer Abreu</a> across the outfield and <a data-player-guid="0bd50e25-c81d-3ffd-9bc0-0489b98498d3" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4872598/masataka-yoshida">Masataka Yoshida</a> at DH. Rafaela already has seen two games at the keystone, but it's still unlikely that he'll pick up another 18 in order to give him 2B eligibility (along with OF) next season. Eight more games there, though, and he'll gain eligibility at second for the remainder of this season. Rafaela already qualifies at shortstop from his play there last season.</p></li></ul>
