<p>In an interview with WAG Talk, Bueckers was quizzed with fun facts about the UConn guard whom WAG Talk referred to as the Dallas star's "D1 girlfriend."</p><p>She answered questions correctly regarding the high school Fudd attended, her accolades and the team that drafted her mother, Katie Smrcka-Duffy Fudd.</p><p>Bueckers was asked about Fudd's phone case -- which reads "Paige Bueckers' girlfriend" -- that took the internet by storm. When reporters asked Bueckers to reveal her girlfriend, she replied "Azzi Fudd" with a grin.</p><p>She did not specify how long they've been dating.</p><p>Bueckers was also asked if her life were on the line, who would she trust with a last-second shot. Without hesitation, she answered, "Azzi Fudd."</p><p>Fudd was Bueckers' teammate with the <a data-clubhouse-guid="179cc0cf-4aff-5dd9-80cb-c4bbf21c5442" href="https://www.espn.com/womens-college-basketball/team/_/id/41/uconn-huskies">UConn Huskies</a>.

However, Bueckers said Fudd will not choose her All-Star Game kicks and that Nike will oversee the shoes she wears.</p><p>Bueckers currently leads the Wings and all WNBA rookies in points (18.4), assists (5.5) and steals (1.7). She was the No. 1 pick of the 2025 WNBA draft.</p>
