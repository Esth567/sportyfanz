In May, sporting director Deco admitted they "like" Rashford and suggested he could "improve the team".</p><p>But that is the bit that currently has people talking - could he really?</p><p>BBC Sport tries to explain how Rashford finds himself on the brink of joining Barcelona and why they actually want to sign him.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="How-did-we-get-to-this-point" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">How did we get to this point?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rashford's departure from Old Trafford has been a relatively long time coming.</p><p>Manager Ruben Amorim dropped him for the Manchester derby on 15 December last year - and he has not played for United since.</p><p>Amorim later criticised Rashford for a perceived lack of effort, suggesting that he would rather give a place on the bench to his <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0m1lemv8w7o">63-year-old goalkeeping coach</a> than someone who "doesn't give the maximum every day".</p><p>He joined Aston Villa on loan in January, making 17 appearances and earning an England recall, but returned to Old Trafford last month with his longer-term future still uncertain.</p><p>However, that uncertainty has been more about where he would go rather than whether he would stay, with Rashford one of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0l4kpg6e93o">five players who told the club they wanted to leave</a> - and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgjge00xjvqo">who were subsequently told to train separately</a> from the rest of the squad.</p><p>"There is no doubt a fully-motivated, focused and determined Marcus Rashford would walk into Ruben Amorim's team," said BBC Sport's chief football news reporter Simon Stone.</p><p>"But, in reality, that Rashford has only been seen for one full season since 2021 and the campaign that led to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer getting sacked.</p><p>"There were signs of the old Rashford during his half season loan at Villa - but there were also games where he didn't perform so well.</p><p>"Offloading an unwanted player to Barcelona is bizarre for a club in Manchester United's position. But that is where they are right now. What they have to do is maximise the opportunity.</p><p>"At Old Trafford, they cannot worry about optics. They have to deliver a squad Amorim can drive up the table."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="So-why-are-Barca-trying-to-sign-him" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">So why are Barca trying to sign him?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>If United, who finished 15th in the Premier League last season, don't want Rashford - why are La Liga champions Barcelona after him?</p><p>Barca haven't exactly struggled for goals over the past year, scoring 102 on their way to winning the league.</p><p>They also netted 43 as they reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2024-25, the second-most in a single campaign. </p><p>If anything, their shortcomings were at the back rather than up front.</p><p>But that hasn't stopped them seeking attacking reinforcements.</p><p>"Strengthening the left-hand side of the forward line has been Barcelona's priority all summer and, for a long time, it appeared they'd be successful in snapping up their number one target, Nico Williams," said Spanish football writer Andy West.</p><p>"But the Athletic Bilbao winger eventually opted to sign a new contract with his current club, so Barca were forced to look elsewhere, with an attempted move for Liverpool's Luis Diaz also falling through."</p><p>While they would have been prepared to pay a fee for both Williams and Diaz, there is a financial advantage to signing Rashford - the deal would initially be on loan with an option to buy.</p><p>"Barcelona's long-standing financial problems are still an issue and they were hoping to raise funds by selling goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who has been supplanted by new signing Joan Garcia," added West.</p><p>"But that plan has been foiled by the German veteran requiring back surgery, which means that signing Rashford on loan has become even more enticing."</p><p>Stone added: "If it is a loan with an option to buy as expected, Barca can't lose.</p><p>"Don't forget, Chelsea effectively loaned Jadon Sancho for a season, then sent him back to Manchester United despite having an obligation to buy after an inconsistent campaign."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="How-would-he-fit-in-to-Europes-most-potent-attack" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">How would he fit in to Europe's most potent attack?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rashford's best position has been widely discussed and debated, having operated both off the left-hand side and as a central striker during his career.</p><p>But his capacity to play in both positions is part of the attraction to Barcelona.</p><p>"Barca are conscious that star striker Robert Lewandowski, who turns 37 next month, cannot be expected to start every game," said West. "So Rashford's ability to play as a centre-forward or a false nine further adds to his appeal.</p><p>"His main opportunities, however, will come on the left wing, which has been a problem position for Barca ever since Neymar's departure to Paris St-Germain eight years ago.</p><p>"In the current squad, Raphinha has been re-invented by coach Hansi Flick as a central playmaker, while Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres are unsuited to the left flank.</p><p>"So now Rashford has the chance to establish himself alongside Raphinha, Lewandowski and Lamine Yamal in Flick's first-choice front four."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So can he still perform at the same level as Barca's other forwards?</p><p>Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances since making his United debut as an 18-year-old in 2016, adding a further 17 in 62 games for England.</p><p>He has vast experience at the very top level - and, at 27, still has potentially many of his best years ahead of him.</p><p>But potential is a word often used in tandem with Rashford's name and not since 2022-23 has he reached the 20-goal mark in a season.</p><p>Despite impressing at times at Villa Park, he still only scored twice in the Premier League - one of those a penalty.</p><p>"Barcelona know they are taking a bit of a risk," said Stone. "And it is not entirely clear what their plan for Rashford is - it definitely will not be taking the place of Lamine Yamal.</p><p>"But they also know, at anywhere near the top of his game, the 27-year-old, in theory approaching the peak years of his career, could be a major asset in La Liga and the Champions League."</p></div><section data-component="links-block"><p><h2 type="normal">More on this story</h2></p></section></article></div>
