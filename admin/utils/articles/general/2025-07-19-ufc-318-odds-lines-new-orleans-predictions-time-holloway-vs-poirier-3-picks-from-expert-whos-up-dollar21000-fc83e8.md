"He also doesn't have a great ground game to fall back on. Veretennikov looks like the more technical striker who can keep the same pace for 15 minutes and I will take him to win two rounds for that reason."&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ufc-318-odds-picks-seasoned-mma-analyst-reveals-selections-for-holloway-vs-poirier-and-other-new-orleans-matchups-on-july-19/#ttag=07192025_agg_cbssports_picks_ufc_mma_kylemarleyexpert_UFC318HollowayPoirier">See who else to back here</a>.</p>
