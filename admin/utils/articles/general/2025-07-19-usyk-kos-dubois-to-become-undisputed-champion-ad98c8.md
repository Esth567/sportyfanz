The Londoner was unable to repeat the heroics of last September, when he sent Joshua to the canvas four times in a Round 5 KO win. In contrast to that coruscating win, Dubois was left counted out in a fight Usyk dictated from the start.</p><p>It was even better than the last time Usyk defeated Dubois, by Round 9 stoppage, in August 2023 and he is now expected to box again later this year, possibly against New Zealand's Joseph Parker.</p><p>Since being stopped in Round 9 by Usyk in August 2023, Dubois has been much improved, with stoppage wins over Jarrell Miller, Filip Hrgovic and Joshua. But he was unable to establish any authority in front of his home fans.</p><p>Usyk was quickly into his rhythm and did most of the work in Round 1, piercing Dubois' guard with his southpaw jab.</p><p>Dubois, who is 11 years younger than Usyk and weighed in 26 pounds heavier than Usyk, put together a strong series of punches late in Round 1.</p><p>But Usyk produced some quality work in Round 2, as he slipped Dubois punches to repeatedly land solid left hands.</p><p>A big left hook momentarily shook Dubois in Round 3, as Usyk's smart movement denied Dubois any openings.</p><p>Usyk complained about a low blow in Round 4 before a strong finish to the round. In Round 5, Usyk landed a left-right combination as Dubois began to look more open and a glancing right to the head sent Dubois to his knees for the first count.</p><p>Moments after Dubois got up, Usyk finished it. After Dubois missed with a right hand, Usyk uncorked a sweeping left hook to return the Englishman to the canvas. Dubois was left flat on his back and was counted out.</p><p>It was a smart, savage and scintillating stoppage from imperious Usyk who is beyond reach it seems for any of the current heavyweights.</p>
