That punch has been a topic of discussion since.</p><p>"Yeah [I was cheated] but it is in the past now," Dubois said during a news conference in April. "It happened and I get the chance to put that wrong right and clear up the controversy."</p><p>Usyk <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/40152003/tyson-fury-vs-oleksandr-usyk-live-boxing-results-analysis">became undisputed heavyweight champion</a> by defeating Tyson Fury in May 2024. A month later, Usyk <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/40432058/oleksandr-usyk-vacating-ibf-title-ahead-joshua-dubois-bout">relinquished the IBF belt</a> in order to fight Fury in a rematch instead of then mandatory challenger Filip Hrgovic, <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/40258756/daniel-dubois-stops-filip-hrgovic-anthony-joshua-fight-wembley">a belt that Dubois won</a> by stopping Hrgovic in eight rounds in June 2024.</p><p>Dubois (22-2, 21 KOs) has been on a roll since losing to Usyk. He has defeated Jarrell "Big Baby" Miller, Hrgovic and Anthony Joshua, all by stoppage, and he has a chance to become undisputed with a win over Fury.</p><p>"They have shared a ring; they know each other's strengths and weaknesses," Dubois promoter Frank Warren said during a news conference on Thursday in London. "He knows he can hurt Oleksandr. He's done that before, and I feel, genuinely, this is going to be his time."</p><p>Nick Parkinson and James Regan are in London to bring you all that's happening at Wembley Stadium, including fight updates, undercard results and round-by-round analysis.</p>
