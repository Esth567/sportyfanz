<p>The NBA has <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/what-the-nbas-load-management-report-didnt-say-about-rest-and-injuries/" target="_blank">studied various load management reports in recent years</a></span>, hoping to rectify a common fan complaint when superstars sit for rest. In January 2024, the league sent a 57-page report to media and players indicating findings through 10 previous seasons of data did not make it clear that resting players makes them less susceptible to injury.</p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-free-agency-rumors-knicks-kings-linked-to-ben-simmons-as-injury-concerns-mount/" target="_blank">

<p>Flagg's 21-point scoring outburst was the most by a No. 1 pick in the summer league play since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1755192/john-wall/">John Wall</a>&nbsp;in 2010.</p><p>Matt MacKenzie, Flagg's longtime player development coach, <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cooper-flaggs-trainer-details-plans-after-mavericks-shut-down-no-1-pick-for-nba-summer-league/" target="_blank">spoke with CBS Sports this week about Flagg's next steps</a></span>.</p>
        

<p>"Cooper will head back to Dallas to get settled in and workout at the Mavs practice facility before heading to Maine in August for a couple weeks," MacKenzie said Tuesday. "He's headlining a basketball camp for a couple days, and we'll continue his training up there as he prepares looks ahead to the rookie transition program and the start of training camp."</p><p>Flagg said he felt "exhausted" after consecutive starts involved him shouldering most of the ball-handling duties for the Mavericks. This was all part of the plan, according to Dallas coach Jason Kidd, who previously said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jason-kidd-wants-cooper-flagg-uncomfortable-at-point-guard-as-mavericks-incorporate-top-pick-into-roster/" target="_blank">the franchise wanted to make Flagg "uncomfortable" early on</a>&nbsp;since Irving will be on the shelf much of the regular season following a knee injury.</p><p>Previously, Green said Flagg holds an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/mavericks-cooper-flagg-headed-to-dallas-as-no-1-pick/" target="_blank">unlikely luxury as the top pick</a>, one most rookies rarely experience. Green mentioned Flagg joining well-established superstars&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1779901/kyrie-irving/">Kyrie Irving</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1992786/anthony-davis/">Anthony Davis</a>, stressing the point there's no expectation as a rookie to be a franchise savior of sorts in Dallas.</p>
        

<p>"I don't think he could have asked for anything better as the No. 1 pick," Green said last month on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeRrEgtDztE" target="_blank">Draymond Green Show with Baron Davis</a>. "You ain't gotta go average 25 points on a bad team or 20 points on a bad team."</p>
