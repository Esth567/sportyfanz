        <p>Rory McIlroy was on the wrong end of one of the craziest moments you'll ever see at a major championship on the 11th hole at Royal Portrush on Saturday, when he hit his ball from the rough and dug out a second embedded ball that was below his.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, on TV, it looked like McIlroy had whiffed on his shot as the ball popped straight up in the air and landed at his feet. Replays showed, however, that he dug up a second ball on his followthrough that was embedded in the ground just in front of his golf ball.</p><p>McIlroy was as stunned as anyone else over the bizarre sequence, picking up the second ball and having a bit of a laugh at the insanity of the moment. McIlroy's actual ball ended up landing well short of the green, and he failed to get up-and-down for par, dropping his first shot of the day to go back to 5 under. He was suddenly seven shots off the lead again.&nbsp;</p>
        



<p>McIlroy got off to a hot start to his third round at the 2025 Open Championship, making three birdies in his first four holes to send the Northern Ireland crowd into a frenzy. From that point, things got a bit scratchy for McIlroy; he missed a few opportunities and had a few wayward tee shots that kept him from continuing his charge up the leaderboard.&nbsp;</p><p>The tough break leading to a bogey on No. 11 -- which followed what seemed to be a great break to avoid the gorse bushes off a wayward tee shot -- seemed to end any real hopes of contending on Sunday. However, the golf gods decided to give him one back on the 12th as he rolled in a long eagle putt to jump to 7 under and create a massive roar from the home crowd.&nbsp;</p>
