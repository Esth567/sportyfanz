I always had faith.”<br></p><p>Besides Morgan, Sarina Wiegman was able to bring on Chloe Kelly, Beth Mead, Grace Clinton, Niamh Charles and Michelle Agyemang, who scored England’s equaliser. Their efforts helped book a last-four spot against Italy on Tuesday, after a penalty shootout.</p><p>Morgan added: “The depth we have in the squad is such an incredible thing for us to be able to fall back on through this tournament. That’s something we’re going to continue to rely on. When all of us sat down on the bench for the second half it was just: ‘Be ready to come on and change the game’ – and all of us were. We’ve just got such amazing character, grit and determination within the group that we’re never beaten.”</p><p>Morgan’s own substitute appearance was her major tournament debut, and she was thrilled that her mother was there to witness it. “It was really, really special,” the 24-year-old said. “Apparently my mum was sobbing when I came on, bless her. It was just really nice to get that opportunity. I have been working hard throughout the tournament to stay prepared if I was called on.”</p><p>Of the 19-year-old Agyemang, who scored her second international goal on only her third cap, Morgan said: “I’m so proud of the impact she’s been able to make. That’s twice now she’s stepped up in pressure situations. She’s someone that we know we can turn to in stressful moments to be a presence, holding the ball up and linking play, making runs in behind.</p><p>“She’s just so chilled and positive all the time, and ready to take her opportunity. She’s such a hard worker in training and so you know that in those moments she’s absolutely ready to come on and make an impact, which is exactly what she did, just getting in great positions around the box. She’s proven all the times that she’s come on that she’s ready to go and make an impact when we need it.”</p><figure id="f4baab48-2d6b-4dba-8814-3b2e4c5096c1" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a7a66bac224816f896da05057f7994f5ef237b/0_0_6994_4663/master/6994.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a7a66bac224816f896da05057f7994f5ef237b/0_0_6994_4663/master/6994.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a7a66bac224816f896da05057f7994f5ef237b/0_0_6994_4663/master/6994.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a7a66bac224816f896da05057f7994f5ef237b/0_0_6994_4663/master/6994.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a7a66bac224816f896da05057f7994f5ef237b/0_0_6994_4663/master/6994.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a7a66bac224816f896da05057f7994f5ef237b/0_0_6994_4663/master/6994.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Esme Morgan and her fellow substitute Chloe Kelly take off after England’s shootout win." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a7a66bac224816f896da05057f7994f5ef237b/0_0_6994_4663/master/6994.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.6878753217043" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Esme Morgan and fellow substitute Chloe Kelly (right) take off after England’s shootout win.</span> Photograph: Ennio Leanza/AP</figcaption></figure><p>England were also grateful to two decisive crosses from the winger Kelly. “She’s an incredible player,” said Morgan. “She’s been training amazingly in the last few days, scoring a lot of goals, so she was high on confidence coming into that game. She seems to thrive on those moments when the team needs her to pull a performance out of the bag. When I saw her cut in, I just knew she was going to land it on someone’s head.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“She had a decisive penalty as well and under that pressure, there is nobody I’d rather have in that position. She is so reliable and so composed and calm. She said afterwards she made eye contact with the goalkeeper and they were smirking so she just started laughing. I just think the composure in that moment, to be so free and confident, and just laugh, just shows what a brilliant player she is for stepping up.”</p><p>Wiegman must now decide for Tuesday’s semi-final which of her “finishers” should start in Geneva.</p><p>Leah Williamson rolled her ankle and left Thursday’s contest in the first period of extra time but Morgan said England were very optimistic that the captain would be fit enough to face Italy. Whether Morgan plays alongside her from the start is one for the head coach to ponder.</p></div></div>
