Could they land both on the cheap?</h3><p>I think it's highly unlikely that Juventus will get both players, for a number of reasons. Juve are not in a strong position financially, and their priority right now is figuring out how to deal with striker <a data-player-guid="edbffeec-f798-0f71-d85c-06a7a76438eb" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/235677/dusan-vlahovic">Dusan Vlahovic</a>, who has a year left on his contract and is on an enormous salary. They have to either extend him -- though he'd need to take a significant pay cut and has no real incentive to do so -- or shift him; but that's tricky, partly because of his wages, partly because he can also wait and move on a free next year.</p><p>In a sense, Sancho is in a similar boat. He also has a year left on his contract and is on a wage that is far higher than his production was in recent seasons. It's hard to see him moving to Juve on a permanent basis for the same reason he didn't stay at <a data-clubhouse-guid="c43a00b9-2826-72b3-77a0-62730abc936e" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=363">Chelsea</a>: he's going to have to take a major pay cut if he wants a multiyear deal, and he wasn't willing to do that at Stamford Bridge. The only way you can see this happening is a six-month loan deal with United covering a part of his wages. But something like that would happen only late in the window. And, bear in mind, Juventus already have a number of wingers.</p><p>As for Rashford, United are on the hook for another three seasons with him. You can't see this being a permanent deal, but he could fill the <a data-player-guid="3a3d05ac-9039-3e7b-e75c-adda1a51ab12" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/252971/randal-kolo-muani">Randal Kolo Muani</a> role (he's on loan from <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/160">Paris Saint-Germain</a> and while Juve would like to keep him, it's not an easy negotiation) and would get to play <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.champions">Champions League</a> football. Of course, this would be predicated on United paying a big chunk of his wages and, again, that's unlikely to happen at this stage of the window. <em>-- Gabriele Marcotti</em></p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/soccer/500-dark/364.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc" width="50"></p><h3>Will <a data-player-guid="9959537e-af42-929e-a829-cc149924d7f4" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257390/luis-diaz">Luis Díaz</a> still be at <a data-clubhouse-guid="a47fbcec-c948-cf4c-9e41-3dfa37588c9c" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=364">Liverpool</a> when the season starts, or will <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/132/bayern-munich" target="_blank">Bayern Munich</a> or <a data-clubhouse-guid="58f7c4a9-c991-4ed4-fe5c-1f833cba75b8" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=83">Barcelona</a> land him?</h3><p>Liverpool have been pretty firm in their stance that Díaz is not available for transfer this summer. The Colombia international enjoyed the most productive season of his Anfield career last term and was an integral part of the team which romped to the <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1">Premier League</a> title.</p><p>Over the past few weeks, Liverpool have rebuffed advances from both Bayern and Barça, rejecting a €67.5 million (£58.6m) bid from the latter on Tuesday. But everyone has a price and, should any potential suitor return to the negotiating table with a significantly improved bid, Liverpool's resolve could be tested.</p><p>Of course, the club would need to be convinced they could find a replacement before September's deadline. But, with just two years remaining on Díaz's contract and no indication that progress is being made on a new deal, the situation is definitely one to keep an eye on. -- <em>Beth Lindop</em></p><div data-behavior="video_scroll"><figure data-video="watch,640,360,45763274" data-cerebro-id="68792ac796581d0c53a7bac6" data-title="What would Hugo Ekitike bring to Liverpool?" data-source="espn"><picture><source data-srcset="https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0717%2Fdm_250717_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_would_Hugo_Ekitike_bring_to_Liverpool_20250717_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250717_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_would_Hugo_Ekitike_bring_to_Liverpool_20250717_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0717%2Fdm_250717_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_would_Hugo_Ekitike_bring_to_Liverpool_20250717_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250717_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_would_Hugo_Ekitike_bring_to_Liverpool_20250717_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0717%2Fdm_250717_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_would_Hugo_Ekitike_bring_to_Liverpool_20250717_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250717_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_would_Hugo_Ekitike_bring_to_Liverpool_20250717_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"></picture><span data-id="45763274">play</span><figcaption><p>2:37</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>What would Hugo Ekitike bring to Liverpool?</p><p>Jan Åge Fjørtoft analyses the future of Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike.</p></div></div><h3>And will the Premier League champions sign a striker amid interest in <a data-player-guid="d29363ad-0204-25cf-7611-8aff328308b1" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/235662/alexander-isak">Alexander Isak</a> and <a data-player-guid="266fab4f-4b99-384e-8dd4-833b3d1d1367" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/304901/hugo-ekitike">Hugo Ekitike</a>?</h3><p>Having already made four major first-team signings this summer -- including a £100 million move for forward <a data-player-guid="6fb5c533-f861-37b8-8315-0d57da82124f" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/303748/florian-wirtz">Florian Wirtz</a> from <a data-clubhouse-guid="483ec574-cb09-6d8f-e308-302d5d695d70" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=131">Bayer Leverkusen</a> -- <a data-clubhouse-guid="a47fbcec-c948-cf4c-9e41-3dfa37588c9c" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=364">Liverpool</a> have now turned their attention to finding a new No. 9.</p><p>With <a data-player-guid="c56f203e-3b2f-5384-116c-c5fb3781e120" href="http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/271788/darwin-nunez">Darwin Núñez</a> likely to depart, Arne Slot's side are in need of reinforcements at center forward and raised eyebrows this week when they approached <a data-clubhouse-guid="ec6b4352-98d3-424d-6214-778d79b47a01" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=361">Newcastle United</a> to enquire about the availability of star striker Isak.</p><p>While the Sweden international has long been Liverpool's dream target, Newcastle have so far shown no indication they would be willing to sanction his exit this summer.

And what's next for his career?</h3><p>Félix has a residual transfer value of £36m on Chelsea's books and six years remaining on a contract that pays him £6.5m per season. Do the math. For Chelsea not to take a financial hit, a club would need to commit £75m in transfer fees and wages to sign the 25-year-old forward. It's hard to see anybody doing that.</p><p>While there is reported interest from Félix's former club, <a data-clubhouse-guid="c0d080f4-ddad-14be-1498-51f86a0f24fa" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=1929">Benfica</a>, and the ways of agent Jorge Mendes are infinite, Chelsea accept they will still have to pay him next season, since the most viable solution is a loan deal and Chelsea will have to cover some of his wages.
