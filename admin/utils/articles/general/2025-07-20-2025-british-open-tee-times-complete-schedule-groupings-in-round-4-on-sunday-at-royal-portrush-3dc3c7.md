The final round of the 2025 Open Championship at Royal Portrush features Scottie Scheffler trying to convert a four-shot lead into his first Claret Jug and fourth career major title. Scheffler put distance between himself and the field with a Saturday 67 to reach 14 under, four clear of Haotong Li (-10) in second.Scheffler and Li will go off in the final game on Sunday afternoon in Northern Ireland with a 9:30 a.m. ET tee time beginning the leaders' time on the course. Topping the chasers behind the final pairing will be Rory McIlroy (-8), whose scintillating 66 moved him into the top 5 and the penultimate group alongside Matt Fitzpatrick (-9), teeing off at 9:20 a.m. A massive crowd will be right by his side attempting to push McIlroy toward an unbelievable comeback win.Chris Gotterup (-8) and Harris English (-8) have the unenviable task of being the opening act for McIlroy's group; they'll go off at 9:10 a.m. and try to conjure up something special to apply a little pressure to Scheffler.
        

For those looking to enjoy some early morning golf, Jon Rahm (-2) and Akshay Bhatia (-2) tee off at 6:10 a.m. as they look to find their way into a top 20 position with Bryson DeChambeau (-2) and Nathan Kimsey (-2) together for the second straight day as DeChambeau has shaken off an opening 78 to play the last two days in 9 under. Tommy Fleetwood (-3) and Justin Thomas (-3) at 6:50 a.m. will be a fun early group to follow as well, but it's all setting the table for the afternoon when Scheffler looks to take another step towards golf immortality. Let's take a look at the full slate of tee times and pairings for the final round as the Claret Jug comes into focus along with all the notable names who missed the cut at Royal Portrush.
