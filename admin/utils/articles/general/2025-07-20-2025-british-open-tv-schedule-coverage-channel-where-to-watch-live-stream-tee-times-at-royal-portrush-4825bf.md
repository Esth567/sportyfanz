A thrilling 2025 golf season has reached its final major as The Open Championship continues its 153rd playing this weekend at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. The oldest golf tournament in the world is wrapping up its return to Portrush for the first time after a six-year absence with the Claret Jug set to be awarded on site Sunday for just the third time in event history.While Xander Schauffele entered as the reigning Champion Golfer of the Year, all eyes have been focused on hometown favorite Rory McIlroy, the No. 2 golfer in the world. Already a three-time winner this season -- including locking up his first Masters to complete the career grand slam -- it was thought McIlroy would be the clear favorite entering Royal Portrush. Instead, following a brief struggle stretch, McIlroy was second on the odds board behind Scottie Scheffler.That has proven to be the correct decision by oddsmakers as Scheffler shot a career-low round of 64 in a major championship to move into a one-stroke lead entering the weekend, an advantage he's extended to four strokes going into the final round. While McIlroy is firmly in contention -- far better than he stood at the weekend in 2019 at Royal Portrush when he missed the cut -- he's six back of his toughest competitor and has just one round to make up that gap. A lot will need to go right for the Ulsterman to win another Claret Jug.Eighteen-hole leader Matt Fitzpatrick is five back of Scheffler with HaoTong Lee the lone man between them holding a four-stroke deficit. The Claret Jug and $3.1 million winner's share from the 2025 Open purse are still up for grabs, and with a whole round of golf left to play, anything can happen at Royal Portrush.While attending The Open Championship is undoubtedly a memorable experience, simply being able to watch golf on one of the game's grandest stages each year is an incredible treat. CBSSports.com has been thrilled to bring you wall-to-wall coverage of The Open all week. Check out a full slate of Round 4 tee times for The Open so you do not miss your favorite golfers taking the course on Sunday.
