description: "United States 5-40 England in rugby double header at Audi Field  Ilona Maher stars as US women hold on to beat Fiji 31-24   On a perfectly unlovely summer’s day in Washington DC, amid lasering sunshine, lowering clouds, debilitating humidity and lengthy lightning delays, Steve Borthwick’s Lions-light England sweated to a six-try win over the US Eagles. Borthwick expressed satisfaction, telling reporters his men did well “in the challenging conditions, two lightning breaks, so the game lasted effectively a long time. There’s a scenario that none of us had faced before. We wanted a short half-time to deal with that but it wasn’t possible, but that’s six new caps in today.”  Continue reading..."

But their mostly young Premiership professionals generally performed with precision beyond opponents employed by US clubs, except centre Dominic Besag, who has a year left in college.</p><figure id="e8d2334f-d188-47bd-86db-e1853553d57f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Lions lay down series marker and ease to victory over Australia in first Test&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;e8d2334f-d188-47bd-86db-e1853553d57f&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/19/australia-british-and-irish-lions-first-test-rugby-union-match-report&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The first try took 10 minutes to come. There was a spell of American pressure but the home fly-half, Chris Hilsenbeck, was sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on and England made use of their own kicks to the corner and driving mauls, hooker Curtis Langdon touching down, captain George Ford converting. Try two came soon after from another US error, Tom Pittman coughing up possession on his own line before opposing centre Luke Northmore trotted over. Ford converted again.</p><p>Shortly before the first water break, the US drove to the England line but were held up. Shortly before the half-hour, England No 8 Alex Dombrandt appeared to have scored from another driving maul, only to be denied for obstruction.</p><p>And then … lightning struck, again, and the teams followed protocol, again, and jogged their way off the field. Fans jogged after them, to jammed concourse bars. When it was safe to come back out, the players had to warm up again. <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/votearama.htm" data-link-name="in body link">Senate vote-a-ramas</a> have flown by faster.

One maul steal by England flanker Chandler Cunningham-South led to what appeared to be a try for Joe Carpenter, the debutant full-back, until video found a knock-on. There was no problem with the wing Caden Murley’s finish for the third, snappishly directed by Ford. His conversion went wide and that, finally, was the half, 19-0 to England.</p><p>England scrum-half Jack van Poortvliet scooted over shortly after the restart. Ford converted. It took a while for the fifth try to arrive, but it did, through a break by wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and support from Harry Randall, the substitute scrum-half. Ford converted for 33-0. Gabriel Oghre, debutant replacement hooker, scored from a maul and another bench new boy, Charlie Atkinson, converted.</p><p>The game ended with consolation for the Eagles, flanker Christian Poidevin (son of Australia great Simon) running smart from a lineout to put Shilo Klein, the replacement hooker, over the line at last. The conversion was wide, the game was done.</p><p>With World Cups on US soil in 2031 (men) and 2033 (women), World Rugby could do with a more competitive product. Nonetheless, executives say they are in for the long haul. Before Saturday’s DC doubleheader, which did feature a compelling contest between the US women and Fiji, chief executive Alan Gilpin told reporters “about $275m is earmarked right now over the next five-six years” for investment in the US.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-12" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="ec7fb03b-3798-463e-a069-c454b62e420e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eccd8bf25ce8c58ae6b7ef4699e5a08221f407/525_0_3040_2432/master/3040.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eccd8bf25ce8c58ae6b7ef4699e5a08221f407/525_0_3040_2432/master/3040.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eccd8bf25ce8c58ae6b7ef4699e5a08221f407/525_0_3040_2432/master/3040.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eccd8bf25ce8c58ae6b7ef4699e5a08221f407/525_0_3040_2432/master/3040.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eccd8bf25ce8c58ae6b7ef4699e5a08221f407/525_0_3040_2432/master/3040.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eccd8bf25ce8c58ae6b7ef4699e5a08221f407/525_0_3040_2432/master/3040.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Ilona Maher runs with the ball against Fiji’s Setaita Railumu" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eccd8bf25ce8c58ae6b7ef4699e5a08221f407/525_0_3040_2432/master/3040.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Ilona Maher runs with the ball against Fiji’s Setaita Railumu during the United States women’s win at Audi Field.</span> Photograph: Jess Rapfogel/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>That money will go into “everything from community rugby building with USA Rugby … through to social, digital, building around the matches that we bring here,” Gilpin said. “It’s not just about putting one-off matches in Washington or Chicago.
