(0:56)James OlleyJul 20, 2025, 10:30 AM ETCloseJames Olley is a senior soccer writer for ESPN.com. Read his archive here and follow him on Twitter: @JamesOlley.Gabriel Magalhães has denied he had an offer to move to Saudi Arabia and revealed he signed a new contract with Arsenal because he believes "this season will be different" in the club's quest to win silverware.The 27-year-old penned a new deal last month that runs until 2029, ending speculation that he could leave the Gunners amid interest from several Saudi Pro League clubs.Mikel Arteta's side have finished second in each of the last three Premier League seasons and are without a trophy since the 2020 FA Cup.They have signed Martín Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Christian Nørgaard and Kepa Arrizabalaga in a bid to end that wait with talks advancing over a deal with Sporting CP for Viktor Gyökeres and Valencia for centre-back Cristhian Mosquera.Asked about the reported offers from Saudi Arabia, Gabriel said: "I didn't hear about anything personally, I didn't receive offers. A lot of people like to say things on the internet. I am focused on Arsenal. That is why I signed the contract that I signed and I am focused on the club."I've been at the club for five years now and I've seen how much the club has grown. I am here to win big titles and I do believe that this season will be different. We have let a couple of titles slip through our fingers recently. We almost won but I think this year, things will be different. I have a lot of faith in that."Asked whether there was a persuading factor in convincing him to commit his future to Arsenal, Gabriel said: "I only have one thing to say, and Mikel says it: We are ready to reach new heights this season."I don't think we can give excuses; we did everything we could in the last three years. I feel like we had a little bit of bad luck sometimes, but we all believe that we can win big titles."The preseason has started. We're focused on what our manager is telling us to do, and what we have to do, and what we have to improve. I think this year will be different."- Olley: Arsenal's preseason in Asia: Arteta's focus, transfers, ones to watch

Pushed on whether he expected to be fit for the start of the Premier League season -- Arsenal face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Aug. 17 -- Gabriel said: "I am improving a lot. I already feel really good. I have been training really hard with the group already. The season is going to be full of challenges but I already feel good to hit the grounding running and play."
