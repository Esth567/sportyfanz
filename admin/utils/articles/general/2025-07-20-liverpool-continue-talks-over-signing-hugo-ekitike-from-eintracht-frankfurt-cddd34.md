Liverpool continue to be in negotiations over the signing of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike. Sources at the Premier League champions say reports in Germany of a deal being agreed for a £69m fee are premature, although it is believed that the France Under-21s forward does favour a move to Anfield.Ekitike is expected to eventually join Liverpool as they look to overhaul their striking department, a situation further necessitated by the death of Diogo Jota this month.Luis Díaz could well depart from Merseyside, with Bayern Munich an interested party in the Colombia international, and Darwin Núñez is still very much for sale despite a move to Napoli the Uruguayan wanted having gone cold. Neither departure will be at a cut price.A deal for the 23-year-old Ekitike, who has an £86m release clause in his contract with Frankfurt, continues to be negotiated despite reports of Alexander Isak, in whom Liverpool are known to be interested, being unsettled at Newcastle. Eddie Howe left the Swede out of the squad that lost 4‑0 at Celtic in a pre‑season friendly on Saturday, with the manager admitting later it was because of recent transfer speculation. Howe did go on to say, however, that he was “confident [Isak] will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window”.Liverpool are prepared to pay a British record transfer fee to make Isak their new No 9 but the chances of them signing – or indeed being able to afford – the 25-year-old forward remain remote, hence the stepping up of their interest in Ekitike.Isak has also been linked with Arsenal, as previously was Ekitike, who scored 22 goals and provided 12 assists in all competitions for Frankfurt last season.Liverpool have already signed Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez this summer, with Giorgi Mamardashvili linking up with the club after agreeing a move last August.
