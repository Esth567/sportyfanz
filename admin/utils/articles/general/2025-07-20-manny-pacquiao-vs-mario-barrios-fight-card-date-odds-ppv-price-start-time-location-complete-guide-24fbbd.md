        <p>Hall of Famer Manny Pacquiao is back. The former eight-division champion has decided to return to boxing after nearly four years away to try and win another world title at the age of 46 on Saturday. He challenges WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in the main event of a PBC on Prime PPV at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.</p><p>Pacquiao has not fought professionally since August 2021 when he lost a WBA welterweight title fight to Yordenis Ugas. Adding to that inactivity, the Ugas fight was Pacquiao's first fight in more than two years when he defeated Keith Thurman by split decision for the WBA welterweight title.</p><p>Despite this, Pacquiao, 46, is looking to do the unthinkable and knock off a 30-year-old champion to beat his own record as the oldest man to win a welterweight title, an accomplishment achieved when Pacquiao was 40.</p>
        

<p>The undercard features another title bout when WBC and WBO junior middleweight champion Sebastian Fundora takes on Tim Tszyu for a second time. Fundora earned the title with his first win over Tszyu, a 2024 split decision that was a contender for Fight of the Year that became a bloody war thanks to a stray elbow. Now fresh off TKO win over Chordale Booker in March, Funodra looks to repeat the feat once more.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the fight card with the latest odds.
