Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Marc Marquez has won the MotoGP title six times in his careerMarc Marquez extended his lead at the top of the MotoGP standings with a fifth Grand Prix win in a row in Czechia.Marquez, 32, who also won the sprint race on Saturday, is now 120 points clear of his younger brother Alex, who was involved in a crash during the race.Alex Marquez collided with Joan Mir early on in an incident which will be reviewed post-race by stewards.Two-time champion Francesco Bagnaia took his first pole of the season for the race but dropped down to third in the first few laps with Marco Bezzecchi and Marc Marquez overtaking him.Bezzecchi sustained the lead until the eighth lap when Marc Marquez made a shrewd move and did not give up first place for the rest of the 21-lap event. Bezzecchi finished second with Pedro Acosta third and Bagnaia fourth.Reigning champion Jorge Martin was seventh on his return to racing for the first time since April following a spate of injuries.In pre-season the star fractured his hand in a crash but came back for the Qatar GP. However, he crashed on his return which inflicted more injuries including a punctured lung.
