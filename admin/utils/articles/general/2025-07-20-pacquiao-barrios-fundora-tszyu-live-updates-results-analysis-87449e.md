<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><ul><li><p>ESPN</p></li></ul><p><span>Jul 19, 2025, 07:25 PM ET</span></p></div><p><a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45619360/manny-pacquiao-biography-record-fights-more">Manny Pacquiao</a> returns to the ring at the age of 46, <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45057278/sources-pacquiao-ending-retirement-face-barrios-wbc-belt">to challenge Mario Barrios</a> for the WBC welterweight title on Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas (Prime Video PPV, PPV.com, 8 p.m. ET).</p><p>Pacquiao (62-8-2, 39 KOs), boxing's only eight-division champion, last fought in <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/32064447/yordenis-ugas-upsets-manny-pacquiao-decision-retain-wba-title">a unanimous decision loss</a> to Yordenis Ugas in August 2021 when he was 42. In that fight, Ugas outlanded Pacquiao in total punches (151-130), jabs (50-42) and power punches (101-88). Ugas also connected on 59% of his power punches.</p><p>With a victory, Pacquiao, who enters the fight as the underdog, (+210 per ESPN BET) would become <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45745412/manny-pacquiao-returns-boxing-gym-where-all-started-24-years-ago">the oldest fighter to win</a> a welterweight world title, a record he already broke when he defeated <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/39745266/keith-thurman-biography-boxing-record-fights-more">Keith Thurman</a> by split decision <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/27231617/pacquiao-hands-thurman-1st-career-loss">in July 2019 at the age of 40</a>.</p><p>"I'm okay being the underdog. I've been the underdog many times. I'm always bringing surprises," Pacquiao said during a news conference on Wednesday in Las Vegas. "I've been a challenger many times and it's always the same feeling. I'm excited to take the belt."</p><p>Barrios (29-2-1, 18 KOs), who's 16 years younger than Pacquiao, won the WBC interim belt by defeating Ugas by unanimous decision in September 2023. He made one defense before being elevated to full titleholder when Terence Crawford vacated the belt to move up in weight. He retained the title <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/42352328/mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-live-boxing-updates-results-analysis">in a split draw against Abel Ramos</a> on the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson undercard last November.</p><p>Barrios' two losses came against <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/38782247/gervonta-davis-biography-boxing-record-fights-more">Gervonta "Tank" Davis</a> in 2021 and Thurman in 2022. Davis, a southpaw like Pacquiao, dropped Barrios twice in their fight, cut him over the left eye and <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/31717260/gervonta-davis-becomes-3-division-champion-tko-victory-mario-barrios">stopped him in Round 11</a>.</p><p>"Manny is one of a kind. He's not an easy style to copy in training camp," Barrios said. "We've gotten a lot of different southpaw looks so I'm feeling extremely comfortable.</p><p>"At the end of the day, he's just another man in there. Another opponent trying to take my title."</p><p>Also on the card, <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/39770746/biography-boxing-record-fights-more">Sebastian Fundora</a> defends his WBC junior middleweight world title in a rematch against former WBO titlist <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/39738327/tim-tszyu-biography-boxing-record-fights-more">Tim Tszyu</a>. <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/39843943/sebastian-fundora-upsets-tim-tszyu-win-junior-middleweight-titles">Fundora defeated Tszyu by split decision</a> in their first fight in March 2024.</p><p>Earlier in the day, <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/38521021/oleksandr-usyk-biography-boxing-record-fights-more">Oleksandr Usyk</a> defeated Daniel Dubois <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45777455/usyk-knocks-dubois-become-undisputed-heavyweight-champion">by fifth-round KO</a> at London's Wembley Stadium to regain the undisputed heavyweight championship.</p><p>Andreas Hale is in Las Vegas to bring you all that's happening at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, including undercard results, fight updates and round-by-round analysis.</p>
