        <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CHI/chicago-sky/">Chicago Sky</a> star <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362937/angel-reese/">Angel Reese</a> gave a sneak peek of a her Reebok Angel Reese 1 "Mebounds" colorway ahead of the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game. She wore them during Friday's shootaround and has taken the court for Team Collier with them Saturday night.&nbsp;</p><p>Reebook first unveiled Reese's signature shoe in the "Diamond Dust" colorway in July. However, no details on a release date for the public have emerged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word "Mebounds" is personal to Reese because it has been used to mock her for getting rebounds off her own misses. Reese, who is mentored by <a href="https://cbssports.com/nba/">NBA</a> legend and marketing expert Shaquille O'Neal, hasn't let it bother her, and instead took the growing popularity of the word as a business opportunity. Earlier this season, she even starting selling "Mebounds" merchandise with a portion of those profits benefitting the Angel C. Reese Foundation, which aims to fight cyberbullying.</p>
        

<p>"She is fantastic and she is a girl's girl. She loves fashion," Reebok senior vice president of product Portia Blunt <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/angel-reese-reebok-release-collection-sky-star-expresses-passion-for-fashion-in-latest-savvy-business-move/" target="_blank">told CBS Sports last summer.</a></span> "Collaborating with her is a little different than when we collaborate with other athletes because she has such a strong point of view. She knows who she is. She knows what she likes and she wants to bring that to life."</p><p>While we know what Reese's new shoes look like, they're still not available to the public yet. Until their release, only four active WNBA players have signature shoes:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677908/aja-wilson/">A'ja Wilson</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678007/sabrina-ionescu/">Sabrina Ionescu</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678022/breanna-stewart/">Breanna Stewart</a>&nbsp;and, most recently,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362995/jacy-sheldon/">Jacy Sheldon</a> -- who <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/suns-jacy-sheldon-enjoying-dream-come-true-with-release-of-signature-shoe-she-helped-design/" target="_blank">released her JS:01 HOLO Footwear shoes this weekend</a></span>.</p>
        

<p>Reese is competing in her second All-Star Game on Saturday night and will be playing alongside <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/DAL/dallas-wings/">Dallas Wings</a> rookie <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29366453/paige-bueckers/">Paige Bueckers</a>, who she has been friends with since their AAU days.</p>
