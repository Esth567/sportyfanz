        <p>UFC is back in "The Big Easy" on Saturday for a night to remember for native Louisianans. UFC 318 lands in New Orleans with Dustin Poirier looking to go out on top. Poirier headlines his final PPV event in his retirement fight when he takes on Max Holloway for a third at the Smoothie King Center with the ceremonial "BMF" title on the line.</p><p>Poirier is 2-0 in their series, submitting Holloway in 2012 and winning an interim lightweight title fight via decision in 2019. Former UFC featherweight champion Holloway defends his ceremonial BMF championship, a title he acquired with <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/best-of-ufc-in-2024-max-holloway-wins-knockout-of-the-year-with-buzzer-beater-vs-justin-gaethje-at-ufc-300/" target="_blank">CBS Sports' 2024 Knockout of the Year</a></span>&nbsp;against Justin Gaethje, the latter of whom won the vacant belt <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-291-results-highlights-justin-gaethje-uses-brutal-head-kick-to-knock-out-dustin-poirier-win-bmf-belt/live/" target="_blank">by KOing Poirier</a>.</p><p>Porier's retirement bout, the 35th of his professional career, takes place in his home state of Louisiana.

"Whether it's fight week or I'm in the grocery store, it's the same thing. I try to follow my moral compass and do what I think is right, and be a good person. If people appreciate that, I appreciate them for recognizing it."</p>
        

<p>Elsewhere on Saturday night, a former Bellator MMA champion gets another shot in the Octagon when Patricio Pitbull makes the walk against Dan Ige at featherweight. Pitbull earned two divisional titles under Bellator at featherweight and lightweight, but struggled mightily in his UFC debut against Yair Rodriguez in April. Now, he takes on Ige, who is 2-3 in his last five but coming off a TKO over Sean Woodson his last time out.</p><p>Below is the complete fight card for UFC 318, along with the latest odds.
