        UFC 318 is in the books, and so is the career of Dustin Poirier. "The Diamond" is done as an MMA fighter after an illustrious run in UFC that saw him among the elites at lightweight for the last five-plus years. Poirier couldn't quite cap off the final moment with a win, however, because former featherweight champion Max Holloway proved to be just too much to handle. Poirier and Holloway authored another epic chapter in their friendly rivalry as the two met for the third time in New Orleans on Saturday. Holloway dropped Poirier twice early, but Poirier did manage to rebound and give himself some life. But in the end, the Hawaiian was able to weather the storm and hostile crowd to walk away victorious as Poirier laid down his gloves for the final time.Elsewhere on the card, Paulo Costa put a jolt into his career with an emphatic decision win over rising contender Roman Kopylov. Costa, who entered the fight just 1-4 since 2020, dropped Kopylov early and never relented on the pressure. The key win can keep him relevant in a rather shallow 185-pound division. Plus, Daniel Rodriguez scored a stunning upset of Kevin Holland after scoring a pair of knockdowns. And former Bellator MMA two-division champion Patricio Pitbull earned his first UFC win by beating Dan Ige by decision.
