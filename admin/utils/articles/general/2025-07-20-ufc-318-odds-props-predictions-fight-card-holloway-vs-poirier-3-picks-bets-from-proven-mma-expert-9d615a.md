<p>He has won five of his last eight fights, but is coming off a loss by submission to Islam Makhachev at UFC 302 on June 1, 2024. The bout was for the UFC lightweight championship. In 40 career matches, Poirier has compiled a 30-9-1 mark. He has 15 wins by knockout, eight by submission and seven by decision.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ufc-318-odds-picks-mma-analyst-releases-picks-for-holloway-vs-poirier-3-and-other-fights-for-july-19-showcase/#ttag=071925_agg_cbssports_picks_UFC_DannyVithlani_UFC318HollowayPoirier">You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>UFC 318: Holloway vs. Poirier 3 predictions</h2><p>We'll reveal one of Vithlani's 318: Holloway vs. Poirier 3 selections here: Francisco Prado (-130) to defeat Nikolay Veretennikov (+110) in a welterweight matchup on the preliminary card.</p><p>"Prado will be the smaller fighter but the more dangerous striker in this matchup," Vithlani told SportsLine. "Although Prado is just 1-3 in his first four UFC fights, the 23-year-old has impressed with his power, pressure and toughness. He has taken on a high-level of competition and now will face a 35-year-old Veretennikov, who is 0-2 in the UFC. Veretennikov is a decent kickboxer with punching power, but Prado is a much more dynamic striker. Veretennikov is 12 years older and seems like a journeyman that the prospect Prado can bounce back against. I like Prado to pick up an impressive win."&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ufc-318-odds-picks-mma-analyst-releases-picks-for-holloway-vs-poirier-3-and-other-fights-for-july-19-showcase/#ttag=071925_agg_cbssports_picks_UFC_DannyVithlani_UFC318HollowayPoirier">See who else to back here</a>.</p>
