<p>Image source, EPAImage caption, Tim Wellens has now claimed five Grand Tour stage winsBelgian champion Tim Wellens claimed his first Tour de France stage victory with a breakaway win on stage 15.The UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider has done a lot of work for race leader Tadej Pogacar in the opening two weeks of the Tour but, freed from his domestique duties for the day, attacked on the final climb of the hilly 169.3km ride from Muret to Carcassonne.The 34-year-old ultimately won by one minute 28 seconds, with fellow Belgian Victor Campenaerts finishing second and Julian Alaphilippe third.Wellens' team-mate Tadej Pogacar crossed six minutes later in the peloton to maintain his lead of four minutes 13 seconds over Jonas Vingegaard in the general classification standings."It is a very special victory," said Wellens. "Everybody knows the Tour de France but not many people win in the Tour de France, so it was very beautiful."I felt super good today. On the last climb of the day I felt really good. I knew the others felt really good but I knew I had to go solo. At the top of the climb I found my moment and I felt I had the legs to keep it to the end."I knew I had to enjoy the moment and kept riding until the end so I had a big gap to enjoy it and maybe put my bike in the air after the finish - but I was so happy I forgot to do it."Stage 15 resultsTim Willens (Bel/UAE Emirates XRG) 3hrs 34mins 9secsVictor Campenaerts (Bel/Visma-Lease a bike) +1min 28secsJulian Alaphilippe (Fra/Tudor) +1min 36secsWout Van Aert (Bel/Visma-Lease a bike) Same timeAxel Laurance (Fra/Ineos Grenadiers)Aleksandr Vlasov (Rus/Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)Jasper Stuyven (Bel/Lidl-Trek)Jordan Jegat (Fra/TotalEnergies)Michael Valgren (Den/EF Education-EasyPost)Valentin Madouas (Fra/Groupama-FDJ)</p>
