"I've always liked his style as a coach, and I think it will suit me well."Every team wants to win trophies and West Ham have that ambition. From speaking to Graham, he wants to create something special, and hopefully I can be a part of that."This summer West Ham have signed Senegal defender El Hadji Malick Diouf for £19m from Slavia Prague and made defender Jean-Clair Todibo's loan move from Nice permanent.They have sold winger Mohammed Kudus to Tottenham for £55m.More on this story
