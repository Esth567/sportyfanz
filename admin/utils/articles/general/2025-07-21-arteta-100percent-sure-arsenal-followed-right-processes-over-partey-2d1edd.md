They play AC Milan and Newcastle before travelling to Hong Kong to play Tottenham.Arteta was asked in a news conference before they play Milan on Wednesday about the situation with Partey."The club was very clear in its statement," Arteta said. "There are a lot of legal matters that are very complicated so I cannot comment on any of that." He was then asked: "A lot of fans have questions over the way in which the matter was handled by the club. Do you feel confident and comfortable that the club followed all the right processes in that?"Arteta answered: "100%, yes."Partey is expected to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 5 August.He joined Arsenal for Â£45m from Atletico Madrid in October 2020.He made 35 appearances in the Premier League last season and scored four goals as Arsenal finished second. He also played 12 times in the Champions League as the Gunners reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by eventual winners Paris St-Germain.More on this story</p>
