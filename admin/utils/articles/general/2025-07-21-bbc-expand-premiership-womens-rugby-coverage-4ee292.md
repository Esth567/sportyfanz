"Today marks another important step forward for Premiership Women's Rugby," PWR executive chair Genevieve Shore added."In partnership with the BBC we intend to give our incredible athletes the biggest platform possible, to show off the elite rugby talent that exists in this country."The Rugby World Cup later this year will be a breakthrough moment in our sport, but the story won't end there."The world's best players play their rugby every week in the PWR, and I am excited to say that now they'll also be shown every week on the BBC."More on this story</p>
