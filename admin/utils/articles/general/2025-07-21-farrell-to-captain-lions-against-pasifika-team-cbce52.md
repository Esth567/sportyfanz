Kinghorn is probably favourite to take over.Might Owen Farrell be a bench contender on Saturday if he performs well on Tuesday, maybe at the expense of Marcus Smith?Garry Ringrose, who is fit again, was having a storming tour before getting concussed against the ACT Brumbies in Canberra.Does Andy Farrell dare to break up the Scottish midfield by picking Ringrose ahead of Huw Jones? If not, does he bring Ringrose on to the bench for Saturday ahead of countryman Bundee Aki?The Lions back row performed wonderfully in Brisbane so it is impossible to see a change there, but what about the back-up?It was Earl on Saturday and it might well be Earl again, but Morgan, having played at seven throughout the tour, is now being given a shot at six. He is fighting for a place in the 23.Beale named captain to face Lions for second timeTuesday's opponents will be captained by the veteran Wallaby Kurtley Beale.The 36-year-old played in all three Tests 12 years ago against the Lions.The 95-cap utility back slipped when attempting to convert a match-winning penalty to win the first Test."There are some classy players and some real talent. To lead them on to the park against the Lions is an absolute privilege and huge honour," Beale said."We are hoping to get a really good healthy crowd. The red sea (of Lions fans) will be coming down all excited after the first Test win in Brisbane. It will be a wonderful occasion."Beale has overcome a hamstring injury that ruled him out of facing the Lions for Western Force in the opening tour game.The fly-half is one of six indigenous players, with the rest of the squad made up of men with Pacific Islands heritage.It is the first game of its kind, a celebration of First Nations, Samoan, Tongan, Fijian and Cook Island culture."We have an opportunity to represent our families and culture which is really important to all of us," Beale added.Tonga-born prop Taniela Tupou and Fiji-born wing Filipo Daugunu have been released from the Australia camp to play for a team coached by Australia 1999 World Cup winner Toutai Kefu."It is an injection of confidence having those two join the team," Kefu said."They are both very good Test-level players and probably not far off the Test squad."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Beale looked lively off the bench against the Lions in the first Test in 2013Line-ups First Nations & Pasifika XV: Muirhead; Reilly, Foketi, Feliuai, Daugunu; Beale, Thomas; Ieli, Paenga-Amosa, Tupou, Swain, Salakaia-Loto, Uru, Gamble, TualimaReplacements: Asiata, Pearce, Doge, Vocevoce, Leota, Goddard, Debreczeni, McLeodBritish and Irish Lions: Kinghorn; Graham, Osborne, Farrell (capt), Van der Merwe; F Smith, White; Schoeman, George, Bealham, Ryan, Cummings, Morgan, Van der Flier, PollockReplacements: Ashman, Sutherland, Clarkson, Brown, Earl, Mitchell, M Smith, RingroseMatch officialsReferee: Nika Amashukeli (Geo)Assistant Referee 1: Ben O'Keeffe (NZ)Assistant Referee 2: Andrea Piardi (Ita)TMO: Marius Jonker (SA)Foul Play Review Officer (FPRO): Richard Kelly (NZ)</p>
