<p>Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Evan Ferguson has been capped 22 times by Republic of IrelandChief football news reporterBrighton striker Evan Ferguson will have a medical with Italian side Roma ahead of joining the Italian club on loan.Ferguson is attempting to rebuild his career after injury and loss of form resulted in him dropping down the pecking order at the Seagulls. He joined West Ham on loan for the second half of last season but made only eight appearances and started just once under former boss Graham Potter.Roma have been in talks with Brighton after earmarking the Republic of Ireland forward to fill the void left by Tammy Abraham, who is playing under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on loan at Turkish club Besiktas.Ferguson was pictured on social media meeting Roma fans and signing autographs in advance of the move to the Serie A side.The 20-year-old was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award following a stellar 2022-23 campaign, when he scored nine goals and made his senior international bow.However, he has scored just one goal at club level since November 2023 and was unlikely to play a significant role under Fabien Hurzeler at the start of the current campaign.More on this story</p>
