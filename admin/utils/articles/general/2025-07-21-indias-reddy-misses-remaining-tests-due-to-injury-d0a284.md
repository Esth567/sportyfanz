<p>India's Reddy misses remaining Tests due to injuryImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nitish Kumar Reddy has played seven Tests and four T20s for IndiaTimothy AbrahamBBC Sport JournalistIndia all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy will miss the remainder of their Test series against England due to a knee injury.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said in a statement that the 22-year-old will now fly home to begin his rehabilitation.India are also without seamer Arshdeep Singh for this week's fourth Test after he was ruled out with a thumb injury."He [Arshdeep] sustained an impact injury to his left thumb while bowling in the nets at a training session in Beckenham," said the BBCI."The BCCI medical team is monitoring his progress."India have added uncapped all-rounder Anshul Kamboj to their squad for the fourth Test at Old Trafford, which starts on Wednesday.Reddy barely made an impact in India's emphatic victory over England at Edgbaston, going wicketless and scoring one run in each innings.He took three wickets for 82 and contributed 43 runs across both innings in their defeat at Lord's last week as England went 2-1 up in the five-match series.Left-arm quick Arshdeep has not featured in any of the three Tests so far.India will also have to consider whether fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah will play in Manchester as they manage his workload.Bumrah is earmarked to play three matches in the series and featured in the first and third Tests.Wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant could be in line to play as a specialist batter if he does not recover from the finger injury he suffered at Lord's with Dhruv Jurel poised to step up if required.India squad for fourth Test: Shubman Gill (captain), Rishabh Pant (wicketkeeper), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (wicketkeeper), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.
