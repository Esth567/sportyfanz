<p>From humble beginnings in the Carolinas and across the Southeast, NASCAR has grown into not only the most popular form of auto racing in the United States, but also one that can attract the intrigue and attention of the rest of the world. And the places that NASCAR seeks to go, but also the place where it came from, is reflected in where its premier division will be racing in 2025.The 2025 NASCAR Cup Series season features familiar stops from the superspeedways of Daytona and Talladega to the sport's most iconic tracks like Darlington, Charlotte and Martinsville, but also two new additions to the schedule both near and far away. The year began with Chase Elliott winning The Clash at the legendary Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, N.C., while Shane van Gisbergen would win at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, scoring the win in the first international Cup Series race in NASCAR's modern era and the first overall since 1958.After a spate of road course races, Shane van Gisbergen's third win of the season at Sonoma tied him with Kyle Larson, Denny Hamlin and Christopher Bell for the most wins among drivers this season. But the tiebreaker was broken at Dover, as Denny Hamlin earned his fourth win of the year and took total control of the winningest driver mark as the fight to be the No. 1 seed in the playoffs continues.</p>

<p>Among the other major changes to the remaining schedule this year include:Nashville  Superspeedway's race date moves from late June to the beginning of  June, immediately following the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte. Michigan and  Pocono return to June dates as well.Sonoma and Dover's race dates have both been moved to July. Iowa Speedway's race date has been moved from June to August.Mexico City's date has come at the expense of Richmond Raceway, which will now have just one race weekend in August.Atlanta,  Watkins Glen and Homestead-Miami have been moved out of the playoffs,  with Gateway and New Hampshire moved into the playoffs instead. The  Southern 500 at Darlington has also returned to being the  playoff-opening race, and the Coke Zero Sugar 400 is once again the  regular-season finale after a scheduling quirk because the Olympic break pushed the season forward a week.Talladega  Superspeedway's playoff race has been moved into the Round of 8, with  that race now set to potentially determine a place in the Championship  4.In the Xfinity and Truck Series, the legendary Rockingham  Speedway has returned to the schedule in both series for the first time  since 2004 and 2013, respectively. The Truck Series also gains an  entirely new racetrack with NASCAR's first-ever trip to Lime Rock Park  in Connecticut.2025 NASCAR Cup Series schedule(* -- Denotes non-points race)Feb. 2 -- Cook Out Clash -- Bowman Gray Stadium* (Winner: Chase Elliott)Feb. 16 -- Daytona 500 -- Daytona International Speedway (Winner: William Byron)Feb. 23 -- Ambetter Health 400 -- EchoPark Speedway (Winner: Christopher Bell)March 2 -- Echopark Texas Grand Prix -- Circuit of the Americas (Winner: Christopher Bell)March 9 -- Shriners Children's 500 -- Phoenix Raceway (Winner: Christopher Bell)March 16 -- Pennzoil 400 -- Las Vegas Motor Speedway (Winner: Josh Berry)March 23 -- Straight Talk Wireless 400 -- Homestead-Miami Speedway (Winner: Kyle Larson)March 30 -- Cook Out 400 -- Martinsville Speedway (Winner: Denny Hamlin)April 6 -- Goodyear 400 -- Darlington Raceway (Winner: Denny Hamlin)April 13 -- Food City 500 -- Bristol Motor Speedway (Winner: Kyle Larson)April 27 -- Jack Link's 500 -- Talladega Superspeedway (Winner: Austin Cindric)May 4 -- Wurth 400 --Texas Motor Speedway (Winner: Joey Logano)May 11 -- AdventHealth 400 -- Kansas Speedway (Winner: Kyle Larson)May 18 -- All-Star Race -- North Wilkesboro Speedway* (Winner: Christopher Bell)May 25 -- Coca-Cola 600 -- Charlotte Motor Speedway (Winner: Ross Chastain)June 1 -- Cracker Barrel 400 -- Nashville Superspeedway (Winner: Ryan Blaney)June 8 -- FireKeepers Casino 400 -- Michigan International Speedway (Winner: Denny Hamlin)June 15 -- Viva Mexico 250 -- Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez (Winner: Shane van Gisbergen)June 22 -- The Great American Getaway 400 -- Pocono Raceway (Winner: Chase Briscoe)June 28 -- Quaker State 400 -- EchoPark Speedway (Winner: Chase Elliott)July 6 -- Grant Park 165 -- Chicago Street Course (Winner: Shane van Gisbergen)July 13 -- Toyota/Save Mart 350 -- Sonoma Raceway (Winner: Shane van Gisbergen)July 20 -- Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 400 -- Dover Motor Speedway (Winner: Denny Hamlin)July 27 -- Brickyard 400 -- Indianapolis Motor SpeedwayAug. 3 -- Iowa Corn 350 -- Iowa SpeedwayAug. 10 -- Go Bowling at the Glen -- Watkins Glen InternationalAug. 16 -- Cook Out 400 -- Richmond RacewayAug. 23 -- Coke Zero Sugar 400 -- Daytona International SpeedwayNASCAR playoffsRound of 16</p>
