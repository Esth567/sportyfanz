<p>Nottingham Forest are working on a deal for the Bologna winger Dan Ndoye and weighing up whether to make an offer for James McAtee, who Manchester City value at £35m.Ndoye, a Switzerland international, is regarded by Forest as a replacement for Anthony Elanga, who joined Newcastle for £55m. Forest were interested in signing Johan Bakayoko but he elected to leave PSV for RB Leipzig. Ndoye, who scored eight goals in 30 Serie A games last season, has interest from Napoli but is keen on testing himself in the Premier League.Ndoye, who has 22 international caps, began his career with Lausanne before moving to Nice. After struggling there he returned to Lausanne on loan, then joined Basel permanently. He rebuilt his reputation in Switzerland, earning a move to Bologna in 2023, and helped them to qualify for the Champions League, in which he made eight appearances last season.Forest have inquired about McAtee but are unlikely to meet the City’s valuation for a player who won the European Under-21 Championship last month. Earlier in the summer interested parties were told McAtee was available for about £25m but this has been re-evaluated and City are looking for closer to the £42.5m Chelsea spent on Cole Palmer.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionMcAtee has interest from West Ham, Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, and the 22-year-old has visited Germany to view the two Bundesliga clubs’ facilities as he considers his next move. The attacking midfielder made 27 appearances for City last season but has never been a regular under Pep Guardiola.</p>
