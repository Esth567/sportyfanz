<p>Stanford graduate and Baltimore native with further experience at the Dallas Morning News, Seattle Times and Cincinnati EnquirerFever star Caitlin Clark is unlikely to play Tuesday at the New York Liberty and will undergo additional testing for a right groin injury, Indiana coach Stephanie White said Sunday.Clark and the team should have "hopefully more of a clear line of what [the path forward] looks like" after consulting with doctors early this week, White told reporters."I think she's progressing," White said. "I think that we're continuing to address everything that needs to be addressed."I don't expect her to be available on Tuesday, so we're just going to continue to take it one day at a time and let her get her evaluations early this week."Clark has missed 10 regular-season games (and 11 contests overall, including the Commissioner's Cup final) because of various soft tissue injuries, including one to her left quad and another to her left groin. She had returned to action for less than a week when she hurt her right groin in the closing seconds of the Fever's win Tuesday against the Connecticut Sun in Boston.Clark, the 2024 No. 1 draft pick and WNBA Rookie of the Year, had to pull out of this weekend's 3-point contest and All-Star Game in Indianapolis, where she was tabbed captain of Team Clark because she had received the most fan votes.The 2024 All-WNBA first-team selection is averaging 16.5 points, 8.8 assists and 5.0 rebounds in a disrupted season during which she hasn't played more than five consecutive contests.The Fever (12-11) have dealt with inconsistency due to Clark's injury, DeWanna Bonner's midseason departure and other players coming in and out of the rotation. But White wants her players to improve their uneven play."For us, it's probably something we're going to continue to deal with. These soft tissue injuries sometimes nag until you can actually have time to really allow them to heal in the offseason," White said. "So, we'll just take it one day at a time and as they come, and this group will continue to progress together."</p>
