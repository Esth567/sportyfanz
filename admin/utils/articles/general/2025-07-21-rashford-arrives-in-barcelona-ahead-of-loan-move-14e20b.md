(2:01)Sam MarsdenMoises LlorensJul 20, 2025, 04:37 PM ETMarcus Rashford landed in Barcelona on Sunday ahead of completing a season-long loan move from Manchester United.Rashford, 27, will undergo a medical early in the week and, if everything goes to plan, will be presented as a Barça player before the club head off on tour, a source told ESPN.Barça fly to Asia on Thursday and coach Hansi Flick was keen to have Rashford with the team in Japan and South Korea to give him as much time as possible to bed in before the season starts in August.- Sources: Rashford close to Barcelona loan move</p>

<p>- Sources: Man Utd close on Mbeumo before U.S. tourRashford was cleared to travel to Barcelona after the clubs completed all the necessary paperwork earlier on Sunday.The terms include an option for the deal to be made permanent next summer, a source told ESPN, with reports suggesting the price is fixed at around €30 million ($34.9m). Barça had made signing a left winger their priority this summer, as Deco first told ESPN in May, and also moved for Nico Williams and Luis Díaz.Williams ended up renewing his contact with Athletic Club, though, while Liverpool knocked back their approach for Díaz.Rashford has been on the table since January, when he ended up joining Aston Villa on loan, and sources have highlighted his desire to join Barça.He is also a more affordable option than Williams and Díaz, given he arrives on loan rather than for a significant fee.Reports suggest he has also taken a substantial salary cut to push through the move, but sources at Barça wouldn't comment on contractual issues.The England international arrives looking to kick-start his career after a difficult spell at United.He spent the last two weeks training away from the first-team squad at United after being told by coach Ruben Amorim that he does not feature in his plans at Old Trafford.He has not played for United since facing Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League last December, with Amorim dropping the player for the 2-1 Premier League win at Manchester City and not considering him for first-team duty again.A six-month loan to Villa failed to develop into a permanent transfer at a pre-agreed fee of £40 million ($53.6m), but sources have said that Rashford has always preferred a move to Barça after the possibility of such a transfer emerged in January.He will now boost an attack at Barça that already features Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski, Ferran Torres and Dani Olmo.</p>
