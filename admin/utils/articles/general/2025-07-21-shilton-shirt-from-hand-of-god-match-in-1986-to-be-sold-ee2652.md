As a specialist auctioneer, it's up there having held nine of the 11 World Cup winners' medals from 1966 and medals from every final since."Second goal like 'dream'Shilton, who went on to win a record 125 caps for his country, declined to be interviewed when contacted by the BBC.However, Peter Reid, who Maradona sprinted away from on his way to slotting home his second goal, describes the shirt as a reminder of a special match.Speaking at the National Football Museum in Manchester, the former midfielder recalled an intense build-up with the world's media camped outside the team hotel for the first clash between the sides since the Falklands War earlier in the decade."When you put it all together - the handball, the second goal, who Maradona was - it's an iconic game. It's fair to call it that."[England manager] Bobby Robson wasn't great with names. He called him Madonna.""But when he watched a football match, he could tell you that someone could play the game well," fellow 1986 squad member Viv Anderson added.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Maradona's second goal is often cited as one of the best of all time"He went past me, played a one-two," says Reid, picking up the story again."I felt comfortable feeling Shilts was going to get it. As he went up, I saw the handball. Maradona did it well. It was cute, you would say that."I remember the ground exploding [with fans celebrating] and I realised he'd given it. Glenn Hoddle, Terry Fenwick, Shilts and me ran after the referee."Reid describes seeing Maradona's second goal unfold as he forlornly gave chase as like "being in a dream"."He was just too quick. If you look again, Hoddle gets fouled, it wasn't given and then Maradona's gone."His touch and pace [was staggering] even with the pitch being awful and covered with potholes. He was just too quick.""From the stand at the far end of the stadium where I was sat as a substitute, I just clapped," Anderson interjects."Well, I was on the pitch so couldn't have got away with that," Reid responds with a laugh.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Maradona's shirt from the game was auctioned by Sotheby's in May 2022Other items due to be auctioned as part of the same event include Pele's World Cup winner's medal from 1958, which is valued at up to £500,000.Gordon Banks' 1966 winner's medal is estimated to fetch about £300,000 while Alan Ball's shirt from the game is expected to sell for in the region of £200,000.Also going under the hammer will be goalscorer Martin Peters' spare shirt from the final which auctioneers suggest is worth in the region of £50,000.More on this topic</p>
