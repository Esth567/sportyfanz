- Scottie Scheffler will be defending his title at the 2025 Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands.
- Scheffler is the betting favorite at +280, followed by Rory McIlroy, Xander Schauffele, and Collin Morikawa.
- The SportsLine model predicts that Rory McIlroy will not crack the top five in this tournament due to recent inconsistencies.
- Tommy Fleetwood, a 40-1 longshot, is predicted to make a strong run at the title and is considered a strong value pick.
- The model also targets two other golfers with odds of 35-1 or longer who could potentially win the tournament.
