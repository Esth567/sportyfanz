        <p>The Scottish Open has become a significant event on the golf schedule ever since it began serving as a partner tournament between the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour. That has allowed the best players from both tours to come together for a chance to play links golf in preparation for The Open Championship a week later. And while many fans are focused on the British version of the Open next week, the Scottish is a tremendous tournament in its own right.</p><p>The biggest names from the PGA Tour are on site at the Renaissance Club with Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Xander Schauffele, Ludvig Ã…berg and Collin Morikawa still in contention entering the weekend. None is in a better spot than McIlroy, who is tied with Chris Gotterup for the 54-hole lead as Sunday's final round begins. The 2023 winner of this tournament, McIlroy already has three victories on the season, including his first Masters, which clinched the career grand slam he had been seeking for a decade. With The Open set to be played at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland -- his own stomping grounds -- there could be no better momentum-builder than a victory at Renaissance Club.</p><p>The Scottish Open is also a nice warm-up for golf fans in the United States as it provides a chance to get ready for The Open viewing schedule that requires some extra coffee for those early morning golf hours. Tournament days end around 3 p.m. ET, which opens the entire late afternoon and evening to get off the couch and possibly play 18 holes of your own.
