        <p>In just 72 holes, a player can turn a somewhat-mundane season into a memorable one, a memorable season into a historic one and a historic season into one of an all-time great campaign. That's what is on the line this week at the 2025 Open Championship as Royal Portrush hosts the final major of the season in Northern Ireland.</p><p>Returning to the par 71 for the first time since 2019 -- only the third time The Open has ever been held outside of Scotland or England -- the R&amp;A has set up a tournament that will do its best to identify the man most equipped to deal with the elements and emotional toll one experiences across four rounds of major championship golf.</p><p>The first three 2025 majors have featured a little bit of everything. Rory McIlroy endured the longest round of his life Sunday at Augusta National to capture the Masters and complete the career grand slam in a playoff over Justin Rose. Scottie Scheffler surged past a crowded leaderboard that featured Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau for his first major away from the comfy corridors of Augusta National at the PGA Championship. And then, out of nowhere, J.J. Spaun enjoyed the spotlight at Oakmont Country Club as the lone man under par in the most difficult test of the season at the U.S. Open.</p><p>Who will step up this time? Don't miss your favorite golfers kicking off Round 1 with a full slate of <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-british-open-tee-times-pairings-complete-schedule-groupings-in-round-1-on-thursday-at-royal-portrush/" target="_blank">tee times for Thursday at Royal Portrush</a></span>.</p>
        

<p>The list of contenders remains relatively the same compared to the first three majors of the season, but new entrants have entered the fold. Staples have stumbled, stars have started to find their way, and surprises seem imminent given the variability that Royal Portrush may present. Check out the nine most likely winners below along with a full slate of <span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-british-open-picks-odds-expert-predictions-favorites-to-win-from-betting-field-at-royal-portrush/" target="_blank">Open Championship picks and expert predictions</a></span> ahead of the year's final major.&nbsp;</p><h2>2025 Open Championship picks, favorites</h2><p><em>Odds via <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/">BetMGM Sportsbook</a></em></p>
