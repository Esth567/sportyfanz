        <p>The final golf major of the season will conclude on Sunday with the fourth round of the 2025 Open Championship at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler held a one-shot lead heading into the third round, and he stretched his lead to four shots on Saturday. Englishman Matt Fitzpatrick (-9) fell five shots behind Scheffler (-14), while Haotong Li (-10) took over second place. Rory McIlroy is one of four golfers at 8 under after shooting 5 under on Saturday. The leaders tee off at 9:30 a.m. ET on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sunday 2025 Open Championship odds via FanDuel Sportsbook list Scheffler as the -700 favorite to win (risk $700 to win $100) heading into the final round. McIlroy is 20-1, while Li is 25-1 and Fitzpatrick is 28-1. Tyrrell Hatton, who is also at 8 under, is next on the PGA odds board at 45-1.

In fact, the model is up over $8,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.</p><p>This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters (its fourth Masters in a row), this year's PGA Championship and last year's U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/" target="_blank">sports betting</a>&nbsp;picks could have seen big returns.

<p>Now that three rounds are in the books at the 2025 Open Championship, SportsLine simulated the final round 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-updated-projected-leaderboard-surprising-sunday-predictions/#ttag=07192025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipSunday" target="_blank">Head to SportsLine now to see the projected 2025 Open Championship leaderboard</a>.</p><h2>Top 2025 Open Championship predictions&nbsp;</h2><p>One surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Open Championship: Li, who is in solo second place at 10 under, stumbles on Sunday and falls all the way out of the top five.</p><p>Li once rose to 32nd in the world before falling all the way outside the top 500 in the Official World Golf Ranking, but he has reemerged this week. However, this is his first appearance in a major championship since 2022, and he only has one top-15 finish at a major during his career. He has done well to hang around thus far, but he will be playing in a pressure-packed final pairing on Sunday and the model does not have him staying in the top five by the end of the round.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-updated-projected-leaderboard-surprising-sunday-predictions/#ttag=07192025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipSunday" target="_blank">See who else to fade at SportsLine</a>.</p>
        

<p>Another surprise: Xander Schauffele, an 80-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.&nbsp;</p><p>The defending Open Championship winner put together one of the most impressive rounds of the day on Saturday, shooting 5 under to move into eighth place on the leaderboard. Schauffele is only three shots back of Li for second place, and he can lean on his major experience from last year. He also won the PGA Championship last year while finishing inside the top eight at all four majors, so he knows what it takes to make a run on Sunday. The model likes him as a deep longshot to win and recommends him as a top-five bet (+170) as well.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-updated-projected-leaderboard-surprising-sunday-predictions/#ttag=07192025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipSunday" target="_blank">See who else to back at SportsLine</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>The model is targeting three massive triple-digit longshots who could make a surprising run on Sunday.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-updated-projected-leaderboard-surprising-sunday-predictions/#ttag=07192025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipSunday" target="_blank">You can only see the model's picks here</a>.</p>
