**Trade Winds Blowing in Major League Baseball**

The Major League Baseball trade market is heating up as teams gear up for the July 31 trade deadline. With potential deals on the horizon, players across the league are being evaluated for their trade value. Let's take a closer look at some of the top candidates and the teams that could be in the mix.

One player generating significant buzz is Alex Bregman of the Boston Red Sox. Known for his elite hitting skills, Bregman has showcased a newfound power surge this season, making him an attractive trade target. With a hefty salary and the option to opt into two more years at $40 million annually, Bregman's trade potential is a topic of discussion among teams like the Chicago Cubs, Detroit, New York Yankees, and New York Mets.

Another player on the radar is Jarren Duran, also of the Red Sox. After a breakout season in 2024, Duran's performance has fluctuated this year, leading to speculation about his true talent level. Despite recent struggles, Duran remains a sought-after asset for teams like San Diego, Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, San Francisco, and Philadelphia.

Pitcher Sandy Alcantara of the Miami Marlins is another intriguing trade candidate. A former Cy Young winner, Alcantara has been on a quest to regain his top form after a stint on the injured list. With an impressive 2.74 ERA in June, Alcantara is catching the eye of teams like the Chicago Cubs, Houston, Boston, Toronto, Arizona, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego, and Baltimore.

Meanwhile, Freddy Peralta of the Milwaukee Brewers has been a consistent presence on the mound, with a career-high average fastball velocity this season. Peralta's affordability and reliability make him an attractive option for teams like Boston, Houston, Toronto, St. Louis, Arizona, San Diego, and Baltimore.

As teams assess their trade targets, players like Eugenio Suarez of the Arizona Diamondbacks are also in the spotlight. In a contract year and nearing his mid-thirties, Suarez's offensive prowess and defensive skills are still in demand. With emerging talent waiting in the wings, Suarez could find himself on the move to teams like Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, Kansas City, Seattle, and San Francisco.

The trade market is bustling with possibilities, and as the deadline approaches, teams will be looking to make strategic moves to bolster their rosters for the second half of the season. Stay tuned as the MLB trade landscape continues to evolve, shaping the future of the league.
