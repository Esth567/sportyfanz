Atlanta Braves rookie Spencer Schwellenbach has suffered a significant setback, fracturing his elbow and facing an extended period on the sidelines. This injury has left fantasy baseball managers with a tough decision to make - whether to stash Schwellenbach on the injured list or cut ties with him altogether.

Stashing Schwellenbach could prove to be a wise move in the long term, as he has shown promise and potential for a strong return once he recovers from his injury. However, for managers in need of immediate help on their roster, cutting him may be the more practical option.

The choice between stashing or cutting Schwellenbach will ultimately come down to each manager's individual circumstances, including their roster depth and their team's current position in the league standings. It is a decision that should be carefully considered to ensure the best outcome for their fantasy baseball team.

Key Takeaways:
- Spencer Schwellenbach has fractured his elbow and will be out for an extended period.
- Fantasy baseball managers must decide whether to stash him on the injured list or cut him from their roster.
- The decision should be based on roster depth and current league standing.
