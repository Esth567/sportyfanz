- The implementation of the rookie wage scale in 2011 has expedited the signing process for NFL draft picks, with contracts now having preset salary ranges based on draft position.
- In the 2025 NFL Draft, most players have signed contracts, but there are still unsigned picks, particularly in the second round, due to various negotiations and disputes.
- Several second-round picks have demanded fully guaranteed contracts or significant guarantees for future years, leading to a slowdown in signings as negotiations continue.
- The actions of certain players, like Tyler Shough, who is demanding a fully guaranteed contract, may have a trickle-down effect on other draft picks seeking similar terms.
- As the start of training camp approaches, it is expected that second-round picks will reach agreements on their contracts, possibly influenced by ongoing negotiations and standoffs with certain players.
