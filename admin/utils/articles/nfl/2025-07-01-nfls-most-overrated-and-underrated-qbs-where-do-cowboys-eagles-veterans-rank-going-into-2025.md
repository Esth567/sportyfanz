In a recent analysis of NFL quarterbacks, attention has been drawn to the perceived overrated and underrated players in the league, including veterans from the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles.

One quarterback under scrutiny is Dak Prescott of the Cowboys, who is considered overrated due to his inconsistency on the field and his struggles to lead his team to playoff success. Despite his talent and potential, Prescott's performance has not always lived up to expectations.
