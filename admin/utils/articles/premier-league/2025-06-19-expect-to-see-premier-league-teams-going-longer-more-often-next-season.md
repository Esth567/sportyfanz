- Long-ball football has been on the decline in recent years, with the technical standard of players increasing and a preference for keeping the ball on the floor.
- Despite the decline, there is an acceptance that going long is sometimes necessary, even among top teams like Manchester City.
- Playing out from the back has become the norm in English football, leading to more emphasis on pressing and increased difficulty in playing out from the back.
- There is a correlation between short passing and mistakes, with teams that play more short passes tending to make more errors that lead to an opposition chance.
- There is a balance to be struck between playing short passes and going long, with practicality being important in decision-making. Tottenham's potential shift towards a more pragmatic style under Thomas Frank may indicate a trend towards smarter passing in defense.
