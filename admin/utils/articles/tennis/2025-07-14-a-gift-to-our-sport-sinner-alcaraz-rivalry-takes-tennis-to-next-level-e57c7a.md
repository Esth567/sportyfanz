It is unlikely to be their last.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sinner is the first player to beat Alcaraz in a Grand Slam final. Alcaraz was the first to beat Sinner.</p><p>The pair have now won the past seven Grand Slam titles, with Sinner taking four.</p><p>They met for the first time in a major final at last month's French Open, with Alcaraz recovering from two sets and three championship points down to win an epic, before Sinner took this year's Wimbledon title.</p><p>They are the first pair to contest the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same year since Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in 2008.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There is little that separates the two in terms of the numbers.</p><p>Sinner has won 20 titles to Alcaraz's 21. The Spaniard also has the edge in Grand Slams, with five to Sinner's four.</p><p>Alcaraz still leads the head-to-head 8-5 - but Sinner has now snapped a five-match losing streak against the world number two. The Italian has also halted Alcaraz's winning run at 24 matches.</p><p>Their trajectories have been similar. Over the past two seasons, Sinner has won 99 of his 110 matches and lifted 10 titles. Alcaraz has won 102 of his 121 matches and won nine trophies.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz shake hands" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/995/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/ec93/live/da2e4ba0-602c-11f0-84f9-89e4b88729bf.jpg 976w" width="995" height="560"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Sunday's final was the second time Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz had met at Wimbledon, with Sinner also winning their 2022 fourth-round encounter</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The pair also have consistently high-quality matches.
