      "content": "<p>Mark OgdenJul 21, 2025, 07:00 AM ETCloseMark Ogden is a senior soccer writer for ESPN.com. Read his archive here and follow him on Twitter: @MarkOgden_.The Premier League title race has turned into a spending spree that could top £1 billion before a ball has even been kicked in the 2025-26 season, with the clubs who claimed the top four positions last season refreshing their squads at an unprecedented rate.Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea will attempt to wrestle the crown from champions Liverpool, and the financial outlay from this quartet so far has been huge. But the teams attempting to bridge the gap, such as Newcastle and Aston Villa, and the fallen giants of Manchester United and Tottenham, risk falling even further behind.Arsenal will hit the £180 million mark when they seal a £63.5 million deal for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres, after already adding midfielder Martín Zubimendi (£51m), winger Noni Madueke (£48m), midfielder Christian Norgaard (£10m) and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga (£5m) to Mikel Arteta's squad. Meanwhile, Chelsea and Manchester City have spent a combined £260m this summer on the likes of João Pedro (£60m), Jamie Gittens (£51.5m); Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait-Nouri (£36.3m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).But none have made a statement as emphatic as Liverpool, who have adhered to old adage of strengthening while on top by investing £185.5m in Arne Slot's squad. When the Reds complete the £69m signing of Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike later this week, having smashed the club-record transfer by sealing a £100m deal for Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz (with £16m in add-ons), the club will take their summer spending to £254.5m - with deals for Milos Kerkez (£40m), Jeremie Frimpong (£29.5m) and Giorgi Mamardashvili (£29m) already done.- Sources: Liverpool agree £69m deal for striker Hugo Ekitike</p>\n\n<p>- Mikel Arteta eyes more deals for Arsenal this summer</p>\n\n<p>- Summer transfer window: Grading big signings in men's soccerSo as the main contenders prepare to get down to the serious business of preseason preparations with friendly games across the globe this week, the Premier League title race has already been ignited by the finance departments at Anfield, the Emirates, Stamford Bridge and the Etihad.Having spent £175.9m on four signings (Nico González, Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis) in January, City's outlay so far in 2025 is an incredible £295.9m. It is clear that the club's Abu Dhabi hierarchy are determined to reclaim their position at the summit of the Premier League after Liverpool ended their four-season winning streak last season.But Liverpool already won the 2024-25 title by a 10-point margin from Arsenal -- runners-up for a third successive campaign -- so can Slot's side be overhauled following their major outlay on new players this summer?With the Reds still interested in a £130m-plus deal for Newcastle forward Alexander Isak, who could become a serious target if Darwin Núñez, Luis Díaz and Federico Chiesa leave Anfield before the Sept. 1 transfer deadline, the champions could simply be too strong for the chasing pack.play2:19Predicting Arsenal's starting XI for the new seasonJames Olley predicts Arsenal's starting XI for the first game of the Premier League season, and wonders if it's good enough to win the title.The 2025-26 season has the potential to become the most competitive title race since the Premier League began in 1992-93. Liverpool are the team to beat, but Arsenal's summer spending shows that they mean business in their attempt to end three straight years of near misses by winning the title for the first time since 2004.If, or more likely when, Gyokeres completes his move from Sporting, Arsenal will have the proven goal scorer they have lacked in their three runners-up seasons. Madueke will add quality and depth in wide areas up front, while Zubimendi and Norgaard will be an upgrade on Jorginho and Thomas Partey, who both left at the end of their contracts this summer.City's reinforcements have been substantial. Yes, Guardiola's squad has seen club legends Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker leave this summer, with Jack Grealish likely to follow them through the exit door, but the likes of Cherki, Reinders, Ait-Nouri and January signing Marmoush have already shown signs of being able to step up to the plate, while City also have fit-again Ballon d'Or winner Rodri back in their midfield.Meanwhile, Chelsea's surprise FIFA Club World Cup triumph in the United States this summer showed that the club's three-year, £1 billion-plus transfer investment might just be about to pay off with a sustained Premier League challenge.While Chelsea, and City, must both wait to discover how much of an impact their disrupted summer will have on the fitness of players in the months ahead, the positive from Chelea's Club World Cup campaign was the manner with which they beat Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain in the final.Coach Enzo Maresca out-thought PSG's Luis Enrique in the tactical battle with his team selection and approach to the final, while the £60m mid-tournament signing of Joao Pedro looked to be an instant upgrade up front thanks to his goals and immediate understanding with Cole Palmer.Chelsea have the XI team to beat any of their rivals, but time will tell whether they have the quality in depth that will enable them to truly make it a four-team title race this season; Arsenal and City have raised the stakes with their recruitment. But Liverpool have made the biggest statement because they simply couldn't stand still.Their message to the rest has already been: \"Catch us if you can.\" So the move for Ekitike and -- watch this space -- a potential extra addition in Isak, is an ominous warning of their intent to hold onto their crown.This season, it's clear that four clubs are going to be genuine contenders for the title and they've all got one thing in common: they have all spent fortunes this summer to put themselves in that position.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Dan WetzelJul 21, 2025, 07:00 AM ETCloseDan Wetzel is a senior writer focused on investigative reporting, news analysis and feature storytelling.Give Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti credit for this: He will advocate for what he believes is best for one of the league's teams. That's true even if that same program previously unleashed an avalanche of headline-grabbing public accusations and animosity on him.In this case, it's Michigan football, which at the height of the 2023 advanced scouting/sign-stealing scandal hit Petitti with a blistering legal filing, claims of personal bias and choruses of boos and negative social media posts from fans.Regardless, Petitti has sent a letter to the NCAA Committee on Infractions arguing that Michigan deserved no further punishment in a case focusing on the actions of former staffer Connor Stalions.The letter was read at an early June infractions committee hearing in Indianapolis, multiple sources told ESPN. The NCAA has charged Michigan with 11 rule violations, six of them Level 1, which is classified as the most serious. The committee has yet to hand down a ruling, but one is expected before the 2025 season. It does not have to follow or even consider Petitti's opinion.The Big Ten confirmed to ESPN that Petitti sent the letter and said he would have attended in person but was recovering at the time from hip replacement surgery. The NCAA and Michigan are prohibited from commenting on a pending case. Petitti declined comment through a league spokesperson.Petitti argued, sources said, that the Big Ten itself had already sufficiently punished the Michigan program when it suspended then-coach Jim Harbaugh for the final three games of the 2023 regular season: at Penn State, at Maryland and at home against Ohio State.Even without Harbaugh, Michigan won all three en route to capturing the national championship.The NCAA might still hit the Wolverines with penalties ranging from vacating past victories, a postseason ban, the suspension of coaches, a monetary fine or other measures.Michigan, as ESPN previously reported, has proposed suspending current coach Sherrone Moore for the third and fourth game of the 2025 season for deleting a thread of text messages with Stalions as the scandal broke. Moore was the team's offensive coordinator at the time. The NCAA was able to retrieve the texts, and Moore was not charged with having any knowledge of Stalions' actions.The NCAA could also punish individuals, including Harbaugh (now the coach of the Los Angeles Chargers), Stalions and others. Petitti's letter did not address that, according to sources.The concept of a league commissioner standing up for one of his conference's teams is not unusual. The business of any conference is aided by its programs avoiding NCAA sanctions that might affect its ability to field competitive teams.Petitti's position is notable in this situation because of the extremely contentious relationship between him and Michigan when allegations first broke of Stalions sending friends and family to scout future Wolverine opponents and film sideline coaching signals.Petitti, in a Nov. 10, 2023, letter to Michigan athletics director Warde Manual, laid out the Harbaugh suspension by arguing that \"the integrity of competition is the backbone of any sports conference or league.\" He noted that \"taking immediate action is appropriate and necessary.\"Michigan, to put it lightly, disagreed.The school vehemently fought back, arguing that due process had not been followed, the case lacked conclusive evidence, and there was no proof that Harbaugh had knowledge of Stalions' activities.The university even sought an emergency temporary restraining order in Washtenaw (Michigan) County Court against the Big Ten to let Harbaugh keep coaching.In a fiery court filing, the school claimed the Big Ten's actions \"were fraudulent, unlawful, unethical, unjustified, and per se wrongful, and were done with malice.\" It further claimed the league was causing irreparable damage to the reputations of Harbaugh and the university, declaring the suspension a \"flagrant breach of fundamental fairness.\"The school eventually backed down and withdrew the restraining order request, but the rift between the team and the commissioner remained as Harbaugh was benched.The suspension became a rallying cry for Michigan players as they continued their 15-0 season. Petitti chose to not attend the Ohio State-Michigan game in Ann Arbor that season, even though it was one of the biggest games in league history. The Big Ten said Petitti was never scheduled to attend the game.A week later, at the Big Ten title game, Michigan fans lustily booed Petitti when he presented the championship trophy to injured Wolverines player Zak Zinter (notably, not Harbaugh, despite having completed his suspension by then).All of that appears to be behind the commissioner. To Petitti, making Michigan overcome a three-game stretch without its head coach was apparently enough of a penalty. He noted in his initial 2023 decision that the suspension was not about Harbaugh but was a way to hit the program as a whole.\"We impose this disciplinary action even though the Conference has not yet received any information indicating that Head Football Coach Harbaugh was aware of the impermissible nature of the sign-stealing scheme,\" Petitti wrote. \"This is not a sanction of Coach Harbaugh. It is a sanction against the University.\"He also allowed that \"additional disciplinary actions may be necessary or appropriate if [the NCAA or Big Ten] receives additional information concerning the scope and knowledge of, or participation in, the impermissible scheme.\"That Petitti is now suggesting that Michigan has paid its penance suggests no such additional information has emerged.Apparently, bygones are now bygones, even B1G ones.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Kiley McDanielCloseKiley McDanielESPN MLB InsiderESPN MLB Insider</p>\n\n<p>Kiley McDaniel covers MLB prospects, the MLB Draft and more, including trades and free agency.</p>\n\n<p>Has worked for three MLB teams.</p>\n\n<p>Co-author of Author of 'Future Value' Jul 21, 2025, 07:00 AM ETWith the July 31 MLB trade deadline less than two weeks away, it's time for an update to our top 50 trade candidates ranking -- starting with a new No. 1 player.Major League Baseball's trade market is ever evolving, and to keep you updated, ESPN's Kiley McDaniel and Jeff Passan have put together a list of potential trade candidates that will be updated leading up to the deadline depending on players' performance -- and that of the teams that could be involved in deals.Some of the players on the list are unlikely to be traded but at least are being discussed in potential deals. Other names might not be on the list now but could be added over the next 10 days should their team's fortunes change. Either way, this will be the most up-to-date accounting of where MLB's trade market stands.Note: Players ranked by value for their new team if traded, not likelihood of being dealt1. Eugenio Suarez, 3B, Arizona DiamondbacksChance of trade: 90%Suárez is in a contract year and playing like one of the best players in baseball. Only Cal Raleigh and Aaron Judge have more home runs than his 33. Despite turning 34 years old before the trade deadline, Suárez is sitting near career highs in isolated power and wRC+ (which measures overall offensive performance). His fielding metrics have declined in recent years, but he's still an acceptable defender at third base. Even if the Diamondbacks don't offload all their free agents to be, Suárez could be moved because they've got Jordan Lawlar raking in Triple-A and primed to take over at third.Best fits: New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Seattle Mariners, Milwaukee Brewers, Detroit Tigers, San Francisco Giants2. Steven Kwan, LF, Cleveland GuardiansChance of trade: 20%An All-Star the past two years and Gold Glove winner in all three of his previous big league seasons, Kwan is a do-everything left fielder with elite bat-to-ball skills and two years of club control after 2025. Cleveland doesn't want to deal him, but with a dearth of available bats, the Guardians at the very least will listen to see if teams are willing to blow them away with offers.Best fits: Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, Toronto Blue Jays, San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers3. Jarren Duran, OF, Boston Red SoxChance of trade: 25%Duran had a huge breakout season in 2024, posting the seventh-best fWAR in the majors at 6.8. He overperformed his underlying metrics, though -- i.e., had some lucky outcomes -- and those metrics have regressed a bit this year. Now, he's underperforming them -- he has been unlucky -- so his true talent is somewhere south of that star-level figure but better than the roughly 2 WAR (commensurate with a solid regular) he's on pace for this season. With Roman Anthony, Ceddanne Rafaela and Wilyer Abreu, the Red Sox have the outfield depth to consider moving Duran for controllable, top-end pitching.Best fits: San Diego, Atlanta Braves, Cleveland, Kansas City Royals, San Francisco, Philadelphiaplay1:14Do the Yankees or Red Sox need to make a trade more?Tim Kurkjian breaks down whether the Yankees or Red Sox are more in need of a move by the trade deadline.4. Sandy Alcantara, SP, Miami MarlinsChance of trade: 50%Alcantara was arguably the best pitcher in baseball in 2022, winning the NL Cy Young unanimously. He was more solid than spectacular in 2023 and missed 2024 with Tommy John surgery. He has been tinkering this season to try to get his pitch mix and locations right in hopes of regaining his former glory. His 7.14 ERA is unsightly, and with the Marlins still valuing him as a top starter, they could hold onto him until the winter, when teams such as the Baltimore Orioles would be more inclined to acquire him and the final two years of his contract.Best fits: Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Boston, Toronto, Arizona, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego, Baltimore5. Seth Lugo, SP, Kansas City RoyalsChance of trade: 80%Lugo has posted mid-3.00s or lower ERAs for five seasons despite having below-average fastball velocity and good-not-great strikeout rates. His ability to strand runners and limit hard contact comes in part due to his nine different pitches. With a Nathan Eovaldi-type contract awaiting Lugo in free agency, Kansas City could opt to move him, especially if Cole Ragans' injured shoulder doesn't improve.Best fits: Chicago Cubs, Houston, Toronto, San Diego, Los Angeles Dodgers6. Jhoan Duran, RP, Minnesota TwinsChance of trade: 40%Duran is one of the best relievers in the sport, thanks to his nasty stuff, headlined by a fastball that averages 100.2 mph and a splinker that sits 97.5 mph. He has two more years of team control after this season, so he'd demand a big trade package.Best fits: Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia, New York Yankees, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, Detroit, Texas Rangers7. Emmanuel Clase, RP, Cleveland GuardiansChance of trade: 20%Clase was nearly unhittable last season, but his numbers have regressed this year. He has issued more walks and gotten fewer ground balls while allowing more damage on his cutter that averages 99 mph -- in part due to more center-cut locations. Under contract for less than $30 million through 2028, he would bring a big return to Cleveland.Best fits: Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia, New York Yankees, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, Detroit, Texas8. Kris Bubic, SP, Kansas City RoyalsChance of trade: 15%With Lugo set to hit free agency and Ragans still on the shelf, the Royals would need to be bowled over to consider moving their All-Star left-hander. At the same time, with the pitching market thin, they understand that the sort of haul Bubic could bring is at least worth engaging on. With a 2.48 ERA and another year of club control, his value is sky-high, and he's a legitimate solution for teams seeking a front-of-the-rotation starter.Best fits: Chicago Cubs, Boston, Toronto, Houston9. Cade Smith, RP, Cleveland GuardiansChance of trade: 20%Smith has been arguably the best reliever in baseball since the beginning of the 2024 season, and with more than 13 strikeouts per nine innings, he could be the solution to many teams' late-inning woes. With four more years of control, he would also be a prohibitively expensive trade target for most teams, making a deal difficult to come by.Best fits: Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia, New York Yankees, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, Detroit, Texas10. Griffin Jax, RP, Minnesota TwinsChance of trade: 40%Despite a 3.92 ERA that says otherwise, Jax has been one of the top relievers in baseball this season -- the best by xFIP and toward the top in other, similar metrics. Only Fernando Cruz and Mason Miller have better strikeout rates than Jax's 14.37 per nine, and his sweeper-heavy arsenal induces as much swing-and-miss as anyone.Best fits: Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia, New York Yankees, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, Detroit, Texas11. Mitch Keller, SP, Pittsburgh PiratesChance of trade: 50%Keller is not only in the midst of a career-best season with a 3.48 ERA, but he's under contract for another three years at a very reasonable $55.7 million. The Pirates need bats, and moving Keller is the likeliest way to fill that void. Teams could be scared off slightly by the quality of contact against him -- his average exit velocity and hard-hit rate have spiked while his strikeouts are down -- but in an environment with little pitching, Keller is nevertheless desirable.Best fits: Chicago Cubs, Boston, Toronto, Houston12. Zac Gallen, SP, Arizona DiamondbacksChance of trade: 60%Gallen was excellent for the past three seasons but now, in a contract year, is posting career-worst numbers in almost every category. His stuff looks similar, but he's allowing much more damage when hitters make contact. That said, his strikeout-to-walk ratio is back to normal in his past five starts, at 29-to-5, despite a 6.04 ERA in that span. Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen said the team does not plan to deal away players at the deadline, but if Arizona doesn't make a run, it could reap a huge return with all its impending free agents.Best fits: Toronto, San Diego, Houston, Chicago Cubs13. Merrill Kelly, SP, Arizona DiamondbacksChance of trade: 70%Kelly doesn't have big raw stuff, having posted the second-lowest average fastball velocity (92.0) among pitchers with 115 innings pitched this season**. His changeup is his best pitch by a wide margin, and he gets by with location and off-speed stuff. He was a stalwart in the Diamondbacks' run to the 2023 World Series, striking out 28 in 24 innings with a 2.25 ERA.Best fits: Toronto, Boston, Houston, Chicago Cubs14. Josh Naylor, 1B, Arizona DiamondbacksChance of trade: 70%Naylor is batting around .300 this season as a lefty-hitting first baseman in a contract year on pace for about 20 homers. Naylor faces left-handed pitchers more often than the next player on the list but hasn't been particularly good at it. His on-base skills and lack of strikeouts make him an especially attractive acquisition candidate for postseason contenders.Best fits: Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, Texas15. Ryan O'Hearn, 1B, Baltimore OriolesChance of trade: 85%O'Hearn is having an out-of-nowhere career year, with an OPS+ of 135 (and with the underlying metrics to support that) along with being on pace for a career high in homers. He doesn't face lefty pitchers much, and his splits suggest that he shouldn't.Best fits: Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, Texas16. Marcell Ozuna, DH, Atlanta BravesChance of trade: 70%Ozuna is a stone-cold DH, playing two games in the field in 2023 as his last regular-season experience defensively. Ozuna is also in a contract year, but his power numbers are down a notch from his standout .302 average and 39-homer performance last season. His on-base percentage remains among the highest of potential trade candidates. If anyone is moving from Atlanta, he's the likeliest candidate, with free agency beckoning.Best fits: San Diego, Seattle, Texas, Detroit, San Francisco17. Taj Bradley, SP, Tampa Bay RaysChance of trade: 25%For teams seeking controllable starting pitching, the 24-year-old Bradley is a tremendous upside play. He's got good fastball velocity (96 mph), a tremendous cutter and a splitter that, when it's on, can be devastating. The Rays have room to move at least one starting pitcher, and teams have identified Bradley as the likeliest of those with team control -- he doesn't reach free agency until after the 2029 season -- to go.Best fits: Chicago Cubs, Boston, New York Mets, Toronto, Houston, Los Angeles Dodgers18. Edward Cabrera, SP, Miami MarlinsChance of trade: 30%All the potential the Marlins have seen in the 27-year-old right-hander is finally coming into focus this season. While his 97 mph fastball gets hitters' attention, it's Cabrera's curveball and slider doing most of the work. And with a changeup that in years past has been his best pitch, Cabrera will be pricey because of the full arsenal and three more years of club control.Best fits: Chicago Cubs, Boston, New York Mets, Toronto, Houston, Los Angeles Dodgers19. Felix Bautista, RP, Baltimore OriolesChance of trade: 15%The Mountain is back from Tommy John surgery and looking like his former self. Since May 31, he has been almost untouchable: 16 innings, 3 hits, 8 walks and 27 strikeouts with a 0.56 ERA. He has another two years before free agency, and with the Orioles planning to contend between now and then, landing him will take more than most teams are willing to give.Best fits: Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia, Detroit, Texas20. David Bednar, RP, Pittsburgh PiratesChance of trade: 60%In a market replete with relief options, the 30-year-old Bednar brings high-end performance without quite the price tag of his peers. His swing-and-miss stuff has been elite since his return from Triple-A, and he has more than salvaged his trade value: Over his past 18 outings, Bednar has struck out 23, walked four and posted a 0.00 ERA.Best fits: Detroit, Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia, New York Yankees, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs21. Cedric Mullins, OF, Baltimore OriolesChance of trade: 70%Mullins is a 30-year-old center fielder in a contract year who contributes in a number of ways, but his power numbers are trending up this season and are at their best since 2021.Best fits: Philadelphia, Houston, New York Mets22. Ryan McMahon, 3B, Colorado RockiesChance of trade: 40%McMahon is on pace to keep his four-year 20-homer streak alive, with above-average power, patience and third-base defense, but more of a middling contact rate and baserunning value. He'll have two years and $32 million remaining on his contract after this season.Best fits: New York Yankees, Detroit, Milwaukee, Seattle23. Pete Fairbanks, RP, Tampa Bay RaysChance of trade: 35%Fairbanks raised his slot a bit this year and now his 97.1 mph fastball has more cutting action while his slurvy slider has more depth, with both pitches playing a notch better than they did last season. He has a club option for 2026 that, with escalators, should wind up around the $10 million range. Tampa Bay's playoff hopes and bullpen injuries have cut into the likelihood Fairbanks moves.Best fits: Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, Arizona, Texas24. Luis Robert Jr., OF, Chicago White SoxChance of trade: 50%Robert has been extremely unlucky with ball-in-play results this season, but that has begun to turn around recently. He remains a strong defender and baserunner, with a career-high 24 steals already. But the .201/.289/.343** line is unsightly, and his trade value has cratered over the past two seasons. He has a pair of $20 million-a-year club options that an acquiring team would be hesitant to exercise absent a turnaround. Finding a match with a team willing to give up more for Robert's upside than his productivity could be challenging.Best fits: San Diego, Philadelphia, New York Mets, San Francisco25. Taylor Ward, OF, Los Angeles AngelsChance of trade: 45%Ward comes with an additional year of team control after this season and his underlying numbers suggest he is still largely the same hitter as last year, when he posted a .246 average and 25 homers.Best fits: San Diego, Philadelphia, Seattle, San Francisco26. Nolan Arenado, 3B, St. Louis CardinalsChance of trade: 30%Arenado is around a career best in strikeout rate and he's still an above-average defender, but his power and patience are trending down to around the worst of his career. He's a solid starter but no longer a star and the team taking him on a deal would have to pay him like one. Potentially complicating any deal: a full no-trade clause.Best fits: New York Yankees, Detroit, Milwaukee, Seattle27. Ryan Helsley, RP, St. Louis CardinalsChance of trade: 60%Helsley had the fourth-best WAR among relievers last season and is in a contract year now but has been notably worse this season. His stuff and location are similar, but the main difference is that his fastball is getting hit hard -- with one byproduct being his spiking home run rate.Best fits: Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia, New York Yankees, Detroit, New York Mets28. Adolis Garcia, OF, Texas RangersChance of trade: 50%Garcia averaged 30 homers in 2021-24, but he has fallen off since his 2023 career year. It's worth noting that per xwOBA, he has been the 20th-most unlucky hitter in the big leagues this season, and he has another year of team control, so some teams could see an opportunity.Best fits: Philadelphia, Seattle, San Diego, San Francisco29. Reid Detmers, RP, Los Angeles AngelsChance of trade: 15%The No. 10 pick in 2020 transitioned to relief this season and has found some success like other highly drafted college lefties including A.J. Puk, Andrew Miller and Drew Pomeranz. He comes with three more years of control after this season and his velo is up 1.5 mph in the new role, so this might be where he fits long-term, and he could fetch a hefty return. Some teams still see Detmers as a starter.Best fits: New York Mets, Arizona, Baltimore, St. Louis, Minnesota, New York Yankees30. Luis Severino, SP, AthleticsChance of trade: 25%Severino tunnels his fastball/sinker/sweeper combo well to limit damage but because he has a middling strikeout rate, his upside is limited to being a No. 4 or 5 starter. Another mitigating factor: a contract for $47 million over the next two seasons.Best fits: Toronto, Chicago Cubs, Baltimore, New York MetsNos. 31-5031. Zack Littell, SP, Tampa Bay Rays</p>\n\n<p>32.

      "content": "<p>That's the question we're tackling, as we asked NFL analysts Mike Clay, Aaron Schatz and Seth Walder to rank every lineup in the league. We combined their rankings to form the ultimate preseason roster ranking, considering factors such as talent, age and production.That's only the half of it. Along with projecting every starting lineup, Clay detailed the strongest and weakest position groups for each team, Walder identified X factors and Schatz picked nonstarters who could have an outsized role this season.Let's get going, starting with a team that has been on the cusp the past two seasons.Biggest strength: Quarterback. Lamar Jackson, an All-Pro in each of the past two seasons and the NFL MVP in 2019 and 2023, is one of the best in the business. He fell just short of his second consecutive MVP last season despite leading the league in QBR (77.3) and producing career-high marks in passing yards (4,172) and passing touchdowns (41, the second-most in the league). The dual-threat QB has never finished a season lower than second at his position in rushing yards. Former Cowboys QB Cooper Rush also makes for a solid backup. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Guard. New year, same \"weakness\" for a roster that is otherwise pretty stacked. On the left side, Patrick Mekari is out and will be replaced by Andrew Vorhees, Ben Cleveland or perhaps a rookie. Daniel Faalele returns on the right side after underwhelming as a run blocker and ranking among the worst in the league in run block win rate (71.8%). -- ClayX factor for 2025: Left tackle Ronnie Stanley. This is all about his health. Stanley didn't miss a game last season, which helped earn him a well-deserved contract, but that doesn't mean the injury risks all went away. When Stanley and Jackson are on the field, the Ravens' offense is awfully hard to beat. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Kicker Tyler Loop. The sixth-round rookie had showed inconsistent accuracy in his final two seasons at Arizona, and now he has to replace Justin Tucker, the greatest kicker in NFL history. No pressure. -- SchatzBiggest strength: Offensive tackle. The defending champs have many strengths, but it's tough to beat arguably the league's top tackle duo, with Jordan Mailata manning the left side and Lane Johnson on the right. Mailata ranked among the top tackles in PFF grade, pass block win rate and run block win rate in both 2023 and 2024. Johnson is 35 years old but hasn't lost a step, ranking top 10 among tackles in pass and run block win rate last season. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Edge rusher. Josh Sweat (free agency), Brandon Graham (retirement) and Bryce Huff (trade) are all gone, leaving Nolan Smith Jr. as the only established player on the depth chart. Smith is likely to be joined in the starting lineup by 2024 third-rounder Jalyx Hunt, who was a solid backup as a rookie. Offseason additions/journeymen Azeez Ojulari and Joshua Uche will compete for work. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Guards Tyler Steen and/or Kenyon Green. Last year's offensive line reclamation project, Mekhi Becton, left in free agency (yielding a projected fifth-round compensatory pick for the Eagles in 2026, per OverTheCap.com). But questions remain. Who will fill his void at right guard? Can offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland continue to work his magic? If the answer to the latter question is \"yes,\" then Philadelphia should have a stout line across the board yet again. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Cornerback Kelee Ringo. Ringo hasn't gotten on the field much since the Eagles took him in the fourth round of the 2023 draft. He played only 10 snaps or more in three games last season. But he has shown promise in limited playing time, with above-average coverage DVOA in both seasons. He has got the physical tools at 6-foot-2 with 4.36 speed, but he's inconsistent. If veteran Adoree' Jackson falters, Ringo could earn the starting spot, replacing Darius Slay. -- SchatzBiggest strength: Running back. I could've gone safety or offensive tackle, but the Jahmyr Gibbs/David Montgomery duo is elite. Since 2023, Lions RBs have produced a league-high 5,960 yards and 57 touchdowns. That's 718 yards and eight more touchdowns than any other team. Gibbs led the NFL with 20 TDs last season, and Montgomery produced 1,000-plus total yards for the sixth season in a row despite missing three games. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Interior offensive line. This should come as no surprise after the Lions said goodbye to standout center Frank Ragnow (retirement) and right guard Kevin Zeitler (free agency) during the offseason. Graham Glasgow (last season's starting left guard and the weakest link on the line) is now a candidate to start at center, leaving the likes of 2024 sixth-rounder Christian Mahogany, second-round rookie Tate Ratledge and veterans Trystan Colon and Kayode Awosika as the top candidates to start at guard. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Offensive coordinator John Morton. Former OC Ben Johnson often seemed to provide the Lions with a schematic advantage. The big question this season: To what degree was that the case and can Morton do the same? Detroit's title hopes rest quite a bit on the answer to those questions. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Offensive tackle Dan Skipper. Everybody in Detroit loves when Skipper reports eligible as the sixth offensive lineman. He had an average pass block win rate when forced to start five games due to injuries last season. Will he need to play that much again in 2025? -- SchatzBiggest strength: Quarterback. Who else but reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen? Allen has finished no lower than sixth in QBR in each of the past five seasons (third or better in four of those seasons, including 2024). His counting stats were down last season, but he still finished top eight among QBs in both passing (28) and rushing (12) touchdowns for the fifth straight year. Mitchell Trubisky is the backup. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Safety. The Bills' roster is in pretty good shape, so we have to pick on a safety group with some uncertainty. Taylor Rapp, Cole Bishop, Damar Hamlin and Cam Lewis return after each played 400-plus snaps last season, though the latter three posted a weak PFF grade. Veteran Darrick Forrest was the only depth addition to the group. Bishop -- a 2024 second-round pick -- is a candidate for a Year 2 leap. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Wide receiver Keon Coleman and tight end Dalton Kincaid. The Bills need at least one of the two to take a big step forward. If they do, GM Brandon Beane will look plenty justified not investing more in another pass catcher. More importantly, that would give Allen another real playmaker to throw to besides Khalil Shakir (I'm not much of a believer in former Chargers receiver Joshua Palmer). If neither break out, then Buffalo has a pass-catching weakness. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Wide receiver Elijah Moore. The slot target has never finished higher than 70th in DYAR (defense-adjusted yards above replacement) and ESPN's Receiver Tracking Metrics gave him a score of 24 last season, near the bottom of the league. But Moore played for the Jets and Browns for four seasons. Will he finally show his talents in a good offense with a great quarterback? -- SchatzBiggest strength: Quarterback. I was tempted to pivot to wide receiver, but even after finishing eighth in QBR the past two seasons, Patrick Mahomes remains Kansas City's best player. The two-time league MVP has led his team to 10-plus wins (career-high 15 in 2024) and the AFC Championship Game seven seasons in a row. He has won the Super Bowl and the Super Bowl MVP three times each -- and he's not even 30. Mahomes' dominant reign is far from over. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Offensive tackle. Tackle has carried over from 2024 as the Chiefs' top trouble spot. The head-scratching four-year, $80 million deal handed to right tackle Jawaan Taylor two years ago has not worked out, as he has posted poor marks in PFF grade and run block win rate in both seasons in Kansas City. With Joe Thuney gone, Wanya Morris (benched last season, which forced Thuney to kick outside from guard) and former 49ers reserve Jaylon Moore are the top veteran left tackle options. There is some hope here, as No. 32 overall pick Josh Simmons could win the starting LT job and solidify the position. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Wide receiver Rashee Rice, pending disciplinary action from the league. Is this the season Rice truly ascends to the No. 1 receiver role in Kansas City -- and puts up the numbers to prove it? The signs are there. The Chiefs gradually increased Rice's role throughout his rookie season in 2023, but he still finished with 2.6 yards per route run. In four games before a season-ending knee injury last season, that number jumped to a massive 3.6 yards per route run. A healthy and productive Rice could elevate the Chiefs' passing game to something more akin to the Mahomes offenses of yore. It could help free up Xavier Worthy downfield, too. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Edge rusher Felix Anudike-Uzomah. Raised in suburban Kansas City, it was awesome for Anudike-Uzomah to win a Super Bowl in his first season with the hometown team. It's less awesome to have only 3.0 sacks in two NFL seasons as a first-round pick. The Chiefs are really hoping there's a butterfly still inside that cocoon, and that an improved get-off can highlight Anudike-Uzomah's natural instincts. -- SchatzBiggest strength: Offensive line. This was an easy call after the Broncos led the NFL in both pass block and run block win rate in 2024. Denver returns all five starters from that unit, all of whom played 800-plus snaps (including the playoffs) last season. LT Garett Bolles, LG Ben Powers, C Luke Wattenberg, RG Quinn Meinerz and RT Mike McGlinchey each posted a pass block win rate well above league average. Incredibly, Wattenberg (first), Meinerz (third) and Powers (fourth) all ranked in the top four leaguewide in that category. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Wide receiver. It's tough to find a major concern area, so we'll pick on a unit that still has something to prove. Courtland Sutton (career-high 81 catches last season) is terrific, but it's yet to be seen who will emerge as a consistent target behind him. The top candidates at WR2 are 2023 second-round pick Marvin Mims Jr. (who finished 2024 strong but was still a part-time player), third-round rookie Pat Bryant, as well as second-year players Troy Franklin and Devaughn Vele. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Mims. Mike just alluded to it, as he recorded a very efficient 2.8 yards per route run last season. But that was on only 182 routes. More importantly, 20 of his 52 targets were screens. If Mims could become a more reliable traditional receiver and maintain a reasonably high efficiency, it would help solve the aforementioned wide receiver weakness. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Edge rusher Jonah Elliss. Elliss was third among rookies with five sacks last season, and he was incredible with the run game, with an average tackle after a gain of just 1.8 yards. He's versatile, with the ability to move inside to rush on passing downs or drop into coverage from the outside. There is some question about when he'll be available, as a broken scapula from the wild-card loss to the Bills might cost him some of training camp. -- SchatzBiggest strength: Off-ball linebacker. It was tempting to pick Jayden Daniels and the quarterbacks, but the terrific Bobby Wagner/Frankie Luvu duo is too good to pass up. Wagner is entering his age-35 season, but he has shown almost no signs of drop-off, ranking in the top 10 among off-ball LBs in pass rush wins, tackles for loss and QB hits last season. Luvu is the only NFL player with 250-plus tackles and 20.0-plus sacks over the past three seasons (he has 335 and 21.0, respectively). The duo combined to play 98.2% of Washington's defensive snaps last season. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Safety. It was a toss-up between this and edge rusher, but Luvu's pass-rushing contributions pushed me toward safety. Jeremy Chinn is gone and set to be replaced by journeyman Will Harris, who will work opposite Quan Martin. Percy Butler is returning as competition at the position, too. None of these players posted a quality PFF grade in recent seasons. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Cornerback Marshon Lattimore. In his limited time with Washington last season, Lattimore didn't look like the top-flight corner he has been in the past ... but the Commanders need him to be. The pass rush is a serious concern, and Washington will need Lattimore, Mike Sainristil and rookie Trey Amos to lock down opposing wide receivers for as long as possible. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Wide receiver Luke McCaffrey. McCaffrey didn't get as much playing time as expected in his rookie season, finishing with 18 catches for 168 yards and minus-12.7% receiving DVOA. However, he comes from an NFL family and entered the league with an 86.8% playmaker rating, which ranked eighth in the excellent 2024 receiver class. He is similar in style and usage to Deebo Samuel Sr., which is a problem because the Commanders just acquired the actual Samuel. But if Samuel gets hurt, don't be surprised if McCaffrey succeeds as his replacement. -- Schatz8. Los Angeles RamsBiggest strength: Wide receiver. Cooper Kupp is out and Davante Adams is in as Puka Nacua's running mate. Of course, Nacua is the headliner. A fifth-round flier in the 2023 draft, Nacua exploded for 105 receptions for 1,486 yards and six touchdowns as a rookie and, despite missing six games due to injury, caught 79 balls for 990 yards and three touchdowns in 2024. Adams is now 32 years old but doesn't appear to have lost a step. He had 85 catches for 1,063 yards and eight touchdowns in 14 games with the Jets and Raiders last season. Tutu Atwell and second-year Jordan Whittington are among those competing for No. 3 duties. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Off-ball linebacker. Rarely a priority for Sean McVay's Rams, this position remains an area of concern. Career situational player Troy Reeder was vaulted into an every-down role early in 2024 prior to a hamstring injury ending his season in Week 7. He's back and will compete with veteran newcomer Nate Landman, 2024 UDFA Omar Speights and perhaps fifth-round rookie Chris Paul Jr. for substantial work this season. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Speights. Following up on what Mike wrote, there's a chance Speights could really work out, which would be a nice boon for this defense. He earned a starting role midway through last season and posted encouraging numbers in a semi-small sample. His 41% run stop win rate would have ranked in the top 10 among linebackers had he played enough to qualify. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Safety Jaylen McCollough. As an undrafted rookie, \"Tank\" got a surprising amount of playing time behind the Rams' two Kamrens (Kinchens and Curl) at safety last season. McCollough played at least 25% of defensive snaps in 10 different regular-season contests, moving back and forth between the box and dropping deep. Last season, he particularly excelled at covering running backs, with a minus-13.6% coverage DVOA (negative numbers are better). -- Schatz9. Cincinnati BengalsBiggest strength: Wide receiver. I could've gone quarterback, but not many teams can match the Ja'Marr Chase/Tee Higgins duo. Chase has been great since being drafted in 2021 but cemented himself as elite in 2024 with league highs in routes, targets, receptions, receiving yards, receiving TDs and end zone targets. He's the first player in league history to reach both 1,700 receiving yards and 17 TD catches in a single season. Higgins has battled injuries but posted 73 receptions for 911 yards and 10 TDs in 12 games last season. Andrei Iosivas and second-year Jermaine Burton provide good depth. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Secondary. Offensive line was a candidate, but secondary is a larger issue. Longtime slot man Mike Hilton and safety Vonn Bell were the top offseason departures, yet the team made no notable additions. That leaves Cam Taylor-Britt, Dax Hill (who tore his ACL in Week 5 last season), DJ Turner II and Josh Newton as the top corner options; Geno Stone and Jordan Battle are the starting safeties. None of those players posted an above-average PFF grade in 2024. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Defensive coordinator Al Golden. So much hinges on Golden's ability to get more out of this defense than Lou Anarumo did in 2024 -- with or without Trey Hendrickson. If Golden can get decent play out of the aforementioned secondary and develop first-round pick Shemar Stewart quickly, that would go a long way in getting Cincinnati back to the playoffs. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Defensive tackle T.J. Slaton: The former Packers tackle was highlighted this offseason by Bill Barnwell as the league's top two-down defensive tackle. He controls gaps and led all interior defenders with a 45.5% run stop win rate. That's a big addition for a defense that ranked 27th in DVOA against the run in 2024. -- Schatz10. San Francisco 49ersBiggest strength: Tight end. I could've gone a few directions, but George Kittle gets the nod following yet another outstanding season. Despite the 49ers' struggles and nearly three full missed games due to injury, Kittle finished top five among tight ends in yards and touchdowns for the third consecutive season (he has finished top 10 in yards seven years in a row). Kittle paced the position in yards per route run for the fifth time in seven seasons. He was also PFF's top-graded tight end in blocking. Luke Farrell and Ross Dwelley were signed as upgraded depth. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Defensive tackle. I was tempted to go with the secondary, but the 49ers' DT situation might be the worst in the league. Maliek Collins and Javon Hargrave signed elsewhere, and the team's only impact additions were draft picks Alfred Collins (second round) and CJ West (fourth). Jordan Elliott (a rotational player) tops the depth chart, and competitors Kevin Givens, Evan Anderson and Kalia Davis all played less than 30% of the team's defensive snaps last season. The Niners figure to add more help and/or move Yetur Gross-Matos and Sam Okuayinonu inside more often. -- ClayX factor for 2025: The health of running back Christian McCaffrey and wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. If the former can play most of the season, and the latter can come back and regain his 2023 form, we will again be in awe of the plethora of playmakers in San Francisco. If not, this team could still compete, but it likely requires a second-year breakout from Ricky Pearsall and another great season from Kittle (along with Jauan Jennings continuing his 2024 level of play if he's still on the team). -- WalderNonstarter to know: Farrell. The 49ers gave him a three-year deal (even though he has never caught a touchdown pass), and he's going to play behind Kittle. It's all about the blocking, where Farrell excelled for the Jaguars in recent seasons. \"He could come in and he could block a 9-technique where George [Kittle] and Christian [McCaffrey] could both be on routes,\" coach Kyle Shanahan told the press at OTAs. The 49ers used only two tight ends about 12% of the time last season, but that's going up in 2025. -- Schatz11. Minnesota VikingsBiggest strength: Defensive front. Minnesota has a lot of strengths, especially on offense, but it's tough to find a DT/edge rusher combo with more upside across the league. Edge was already a strength following last season's additions of Jonathan Greenard and Andrew Van Ginkel, who were two of the nine players in the NFL with 11.5 or more sacks last season. The group will be even stronger this season if 2024 first-round pick Dallas Turner makes a leap. Minnesota also beefed up its interior during free agency, adding Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave to go with Harrison Phillips. Injuries were a problem last season, but Allen and Hargrave have been difference-makers when healthy. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Cornerback. Quarterback would've been an easy pick, as J.J. McCarthy has yet to take a regular-season snap, but I'm more concerned about the corner situation. Byron Murphy Jr. was a good re-signing, but Stephon Gilmore and Shaquill Griffin both departed this offseason. That duo is set to be replaced by some combination of Mekhi Blackmon (missed all of last season with a torn ACL) and journeymen Isaiah Rodgers, Jeff Okudah, Tavierre Thomas and Ambry Thomas. -- ClayX factor for 2025: McCarthy. He's walking into about as good a situation as one could imagine: Playing for a QB-friendly and great offensive scheme designer in Kevin O'Connell, throwing to possibly the best wide receiver in the game in Justin Jefferson (along with a good No. 2 in Jordan Addison and tight end in T.J. Hockenson) and playing behind a line with strong potential. That all helps substantially, but there are no guarantees. If McCarthy isn't at least decent, it won't work. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Wide receiver Rondale Moore. A 2021 second-round pick, Moore never put up more than 435 receiving yards in a season during three seasons with the Cardinals. He was traded to Atlanta last season, but he missed the entire year with a knee injury. Now, on an one-year, prove-it deal with the Vikings, Moore can compete with Jalen Nailor for snaps to WR3. Can Moore finally really produce as a receiver? And will O'Connell also use Moore's rushing skills? He had 28 carries for 178 yards and a touchdown in 2023. -- Schatz12. Tampa Bay BuccaneersBiggest strength: Wide receiver. The Buccaneers have had one of the league's top WR duos for a while in Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. Evans (1,000-plus receiving yards all 11 NFL seasons) is entering his age-32 campaign but seemingly hasn't lost a step. Godwin led the NFL in receptions prior to a season-ending injury and though his status is in doubt for the beginning of 2025, Tampa Bay is well stocked with depth. Jalen McMillan (a 2024 third-round pick) scored eight TDs in his final five games of 2024, and the team spent its first-round pick on Emeka Egbuka. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Edge rusher. The Bucs' roster is pretty solid and balanced so I'm being picky, but edge rusher continues to be the largest concern. Yaya Diaby played well in a hefty 808 snaps last season, though he was limited to 4.5 sacks (the Bucs' current group totaled 11.0 sacks in 2024). Perhaps the Bucs can get newcomer Haason Reddick back on track, but that's no sure thing after a down season (1.0 sack in 10 games) and in his age-30 campaign. A bright spot is that youngsters Chris Braswell, David Walker and Elijah Roberts all offer potential. -- ClayX factor for 2025: The fallout from Tristan Wirfs' knee injury. How long will the star tackle be out? Can the Bucs weather the storm during his absence? Will he immediately return to stardom once he returns? Part of the Buccaneers' success in 2024 was a line that ranked top six in both pass block and run block win rate. It will be much harder to continue their level of play without Wirfs as an advantage in the trenches. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Linebacker SirVocea Dennis. The third-year man has impressed in OTAs despite coming off shoulder surgery and playing only four games last season. His positives include play recognition and range in pass coverage, as he was a defensive back in high school. \"He gets his hands on a lot of balls and I want to say [he has had] a very good four days,\" Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles said after OTAs. Don't be surprised if Dennis ends up starting ahead of free agent addition Anthony Walker Jr. at middle linebacker. -- Schatz13. Houston TexansBiggest strength: Edge rusher. This was a toss-up between edge and cornerback, but the former gets the nod. Danielle Hunter was as advertised in his first season in Houston, registering 12.0 sacks (he now has 10.5-plus in six of the past eight seasons) and a league-high 77 pass rush wins. Will Anderson Jr. wasn't far behind, racking up 11.0 sacks and 46 pass rush wins (13th most) despite missing three games. Denico Autry, Derek Barnett and Darrell Taylor add terrific depth. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Interior defensive line. Offensive line was a strong candidate, but DT is arguably a larger concern. Tim Settle Jr., Mario Edwards Jr., Folorunso Fatukasi, Tommy Togiai and Kurt Hinish all return from last season's group; the only significant addition was 31-year-old Sheldon Rankins. Autry will factor in, though he's entering his age-34 season and has primarily aligned at edge. No one from this group cleared 31 tackles or posted an above-average PFF grade in 2024. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Rookie wide receiver Jayden Higgins. Houston entered 2025 needing another big-time option at pass catcher, especially after Tank Dell suffered a serious knee injury late last season. If Higgins, whom Houston took with the No. 34 pick, can be that player, then the Texans would have a formidable receiver room with Nico Collins also on the outside and Christian Kirk in the slot. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Offensive tackle Blake Fisher. The Texans have a lot of linemen in the mix and could go a lot of ways with their starting lineup. However, it has to be surprising for a second-round, second-year player like Fisher to look up and see so many players as potential competition. Fisher had some average-at-best games at right tackle last season and rough lowlights against the Chiefs in the AFC divisional round. His 85.6% pass block win rate was well below average. -- Schatz14. Green Bay PackersBiggest strength: Safety. A very solid offensive line was under consideration, but a safety room led by Xavier McKinney gets the nod. McKinney was a home run acquisition last offseason, as the ex-Giant produced eight interceptions (second most in the NFL) and posted PFF's sixth-highest grade for a safety. A pair of 2024 draft selections, Javon Bullard (second round) and Evan Williams (fourth), each played substantial roles as rookies and are candidates for a Year 2 leap in a defense that loves three-safety looks. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Cornerback. Standout corners Jaire Alexander and Eric Stokes departed this offseason and were \"replaced\" by Nate Hobbs and seventh-round rookie Micah Robinson. The shake-up positions Hobbs (who, like Alexander, has struggled with injuries in recent seasons) for a starting role, along with Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine. No other corner on the roster played a regular-season snap last season. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Linebacker Edgerrin Cooper. His numbers as a rookie were quietly excellent. He recorded a 46% run stop win rate in 2024, which would have ranked first among all linebackers had he played enough to qualify. His 0.6 yards per coverage snap was better than average for the position. And he rushed the passer 46 times, resulting in a solid 19% pass rush win rate and 3.5 sacks. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Edge rusher Lukas Van Ness. The 2023 first-round pick still hasn't broken into the starting lineup. He had only 3.0 sacks last season but did manage 22 pressures and was reasonable in run defense. The Packers are still looking to get more out of him this season, especially with their questionable depth at the position. -- Schatz15. Chicago BearsBiggest strength: Offensive line. I could've gone a few directions here (WR? TE? DB?), but Chicago's O-line has a shot to be one of the league's best. That might seem silly considering the Bears allowed a league-high 68 sacks last season, but they ranked 15th in pass block win rate (60.4%) and eighth in run block win rate (72.5%) and are now substantially better on paper. All three interior positions were upgraded (left guard Joe Thuney, center Drew Dalman and right guard Jonah Jackson) next to standout tackles Braxton Jones and Darnell Wright. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Running back. The Chicago roster is in pretty darn good shape, so this is more about that and less about what is a passable running back situation. D'Andre Swift was busy in his first season in Chicago, finishing top 10 in snaps, carries and routes, though he was limited to six touchdowns and averaged a career-low 3.79 yards per carry. Roschon Johnson (3.7 yards per carry on 136 carries, 5.0 yards per target on 63 targets) is the primary backup and could be pushed by seventh-round flier Kyle Monangai. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Quarterback Caleb Williams. It's the obvious call but the right one. Williams can either ascend to meet his potential or continue to scuffle in Year 2. Which he does will be everything. Williams' rookie season numbers were poor: A 46.7 QBR (28th), 10% sack rate (31st), 5.1 yards per dropback (32nd) and a minus-1.4% completion percentage over expectation per NFL Next Gen Stats (25th). But a year of experience and new head coach Ben Johnson could be enough to unlock Williams into the quarterback the Bears dreamed he would become. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Edge rusher Austin Booker. There's very little depth on the edge, so the Bears will need contributions from Booker, a 2024 fifth-round pick. But Booker was one of the lowest-ranking prospects in last year's class, according to my SackSEER projections. Booker had 1.5 sacks and eight pressures last season, according to FTN Data charting. That was less production than departed edge backups Darrell Taylor or Jacob Martin. -- Schatz16. Los Angeles ChargersBiggest strength: Offensive tackle. Rashawn Slater, a 2021 first-round pick, has quickly emerged as one of the league's best left tackles. He was PFF's second-highest-graded tackle and ranked 10th among all linemen in run block win rate last season. On the opposite end, 2024 fifth pick Joe Alt looked the part as a first-year starter last season, ranking seventh in pass block win rate and 14th in run block win rate among 80 qualified tackles -- ClayBiggest weakness: Interior defensive line. Da'Shawn Hand should be a helpful add, but this position remains an area of concern. Otito Ogbonnia (graded 86th at PFF among 89 DTs who played 400-plus snaps last season) remains positioned for a big role along with Teair Tart (the only one in this group with more than one sack last season), third-round rookie Jamaree Caldwell, Naquan Jones and Scott Matlock. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Cornerbacks Cam Hart, Tarheeb Still and Donte Jackson. A year ago, defensive coordinator Jesse Minter worked some magic to get the most out of his corner group, which included Kristian Fulton, Hart and Still (the latter two were both rookie, Day 3 picks). The Chargers finished with the sixth-best EPA allowed per dropback in the league. Now Minter needs to do it again with the two second-year players and 29-year-old Jackson, who is in his first season in Los Angeles. Whether 2024 was a one-year wonder or not will determine the success of this defense, which is lacking pass rush. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Center Andre James. A free agent addition from the Raiders, James is a fascinating player because he presents such a disconnect between metrics and scouting. He's consistently great in pass block win rate: fifth among centers last season and second the year before. He wasn't that far below average on a lot of run plays last season, but he looked like a disaster on film. What will run-first head coach Jim Harbaugh do if injuries on the interior offensive line force James into the starting lineup? -- Schatz17. Arizona CardinalsBiggest strength: Interior defensive line. Their biggest weakness last season has become their biggest strength. After finishing 2024 ranked 28th and 20th in pass rush win rate (33.3%) and run stop win rate (29.8%), respectively, Arizona now has potential. Standout veterans Dalvin Tomlinson and Calais Campbell were signed to anchor the interior, with recent first-round picks Darius Robinson (2024) and Walter Nolen III (2025) adding upside. Justin Jones, L.J. Collier, Dante Stills and Bilal Nichols will compete for depth roles. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Off-ball linebacker. Kyzir White (second among Arizona defenders in snaps played in 2024) was not re-signed, which leaves journeymen Mack Wilson Sr. and Akeem Davis-Gaither, along with fourth-round rookie Cody Simon, as the most notable options. This group will have to step up, considering the team's impressive DT/edge group. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Edge Josh Sweat. Which version will the Cardinals get? Will it be the Sweat who had 2.5 sacks in Super Bowl LIX for the Eagles and who beat his blocker repeatedly with above-average pass rush win rates in 2021, 2022 or 2023? Or will he be the 2024 regular-season Sweat, who had a below-average 11% pass rush win rate at edge to go with 8.0 sacks? -- WalderNonstarter to know: Edge rusher Baron Browning. Browning has never played a full season since entering the NFL in 2021 and had only two sacks and 18 pressures last season, which he split between Denver and Arizona. Browning will get a chance for plenty of playing time this season in an edge rusher rotation made up of Sweat and a lot of \"maybe\" players. -- Schatz18. Dallas CowboysBiggest strength: Wide receiver. It starts with CeeDee Lamb, who managed his third straight 100-plus-catch season despite missing two games and being without Dak Prescott for most of 2024. Since 2022, Lamb, 26, leads the NFL in receptions (343) and is top five in yards (4,302) and touchdowns (27). Lamb's new running mate, George Pickens, failed to reach his ceiling while overcoming shaky QB play in Pittsburgh. But he has still produced 800-plus yards in all three of his NFL seasons. Jalen Tolbert, KaVontae Turpin and Jonathan Mingo provide serviceable depth. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Running back. This wasn't a tough choice for a team that hasn't prioritized the position recently. Out is Rico Dowdle and in are Javonte Williams, Miles Sanders and Day 3 rookie Jaydon Blue. Williams has the highest ceiling, but the 25-year-old has struggled badly with efficiency since tearing his ACL in 2022. Sanders was a nonfactor during two seasons in Carolina, though he showed some juice with 116 total yards and two touchdowns in Week 18 last season. -- ClayX factor for 2025: The right side of the offensive line. Last season, rookie left tackle Tyler Guyton, left guard Tyler Smith and rookie center Cooper Beebe were all average to great in pass block win rate. But rookie right guard Tyler Booker isn't solidified, and right tackle Terence Steele finished 56th out of 66 tackles in pass block win rate in 2024. If Booker and Steele could each be average pass protectors, Dallas could have a surprisingly strong line in front of Prescott. It's a big \"if,\" though. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Linebacker Jack Sanborn. Sanborn followed new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus from Chicago, and Sanborn will get some playing time early in the season while DeMarvion Overshown recovers from his knee injury last December. Sanborn doesn't play enough to accumulate a lot of stats, but he has been a useful player against the pass and run. -- Schatz19. Pittsburgh SteelersBiggest strength: Edge rusher. T.J. Watt has been an All-Pro in each of his past five healthy seasons and has an NFL-high 108.0 sacks since entering the league in 2017 (only he and Myles Garrett have more than 83.0). Running mate Alex Highsmith missed six games last season, but he remained a full-time player when healthy and his 33.5 sacks over the past four seasons ranks 16th in the league. Nick Herbig (5.5 sacks in 13 games) was terrific in an expanded role last season. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Offensive tackle. Tackle is a major question, but there's hope about who will protect Aaron Rodgers. Broderick Jones (2023) and Troy Fautanu (2024) were recent first-round picks who could make a big leap forward this season. After struggling at right tackle the past two seasons, Jones is set to take over for Dan Moore Jr. at left tackle this season. Fautanu (who played 49 snaps as a rookie) will replace Jones on the right side. -- ClayX factor for 2025: The secondary. The Steelers' recipe for success in 2025 is a passable offense with an elite defense. Regarding the latter, the pass rush is fully there. The questions are in the secondary. Can Jalen Ramsey and Darius Slay play like their younger selves? Can Joey Porter Jr. get the penalties in check? Can Juan Thornhill be an adequate replacement for Minkah Fitzpatrick as the deep safety? If the answer to all three questions is \"yes,\" then the Steelers will be dangerous. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Wide receiver Roman Wilson. The Steelers took Wilson in the third round last year, but he played only five snaps as a rookie because of ankle and hamstring injuries. Wilson's speed and route running were impressive coming out of Michigan, and the Steelers have a history of developing midround receivers into stars. He'll compete with Calvin Austin III for snaps in the slot this season. -- Schatz20. Seattle SeahawksBiggest strength: Interior defensive line. The Seahawks remain stacked up front, with Leonard Williams leading the way. Williams is still playing at a superstar level at age 31. He led all interior linemen with 11 sacks and ranked fourth with 35 pass rush wins last season. Jarran Reed (4.5 sacks in 2024) and Johnathan Hankins are back. Byron Murphy II, a 2024 first-round pick, is a candidate for a second-year leap after a solid rookie showing. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Offensive line. Seattle's offensive line outlook is better than it was a year ago, but this unit still has plenty of uncertainty outside of star LT Charles Cross. Left guard could be solid if first-round rookie Grey Zabel works out, but the rest of the projected starting line (C Olu Oluwatimi, RG Anthony Bradford, RT Abraham Lucas) posted shaky/poor PFF grades and run block win rates a year ago. None of them has played a full season as a starter in the past two seasons. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Wide receiver Cooper Kupp. As good as Jaxon Smith-Njigba is, this offense will need a second receiver for Sam Darnold, and Kupp is the best candidate. I'm skeptical he can fill that role -- his 1,947-yard 2021 season looks like an outlier -- but there's a chance. Seattle probably needs Kupp or someone else to step up to compete in a tough NFC West. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence. There aren't a lot of teams that have a player with 61.5 career sacks coming off the bench. Lawrence wants to prove he still has something in the tank at age 33, and his three sacks last season came in only four games before a Lisfranc foot injury cost him most of the 2024 season. He should be an important part of the Seahawks' pass rush. -- Schatz21. New England PatriotsBiggest strength: Secondary. The Patriots beefed up at cornerback by signing standout Carlton Davis III as a running mate for Christian Gonzalez, a move that supplies New England with one of the league's top perimeter duos. Marcus Jones has developed into a quality slot corner. Jabrill Peppers has emerged as an elite safety in recent seasons, and he'll be joined by Kyle Dugger and newcomer Marcus Epps. All three safeties battled injuries last season but have been solid-to-good starters when healthy. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Wide receiver. The much-improved Patriots are fairly balanced, which made this harder than expected. The Patriots upgraded their receivers, but questions remain. Stefon Diggs was one of the league's best receivers in his prime, but he's 31 years old and recovering from last year's torn ACL. DeMario Douglas is a solid slot man, but he's undersized and limited to short-range work. Kendrick Bourne and Mack Hollins are serviceable, but the team still hopes for a breakout from youngsters Kyle Williams, Ja'Lynn Polk, Kayshon Boutte and/or Javon Baker. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Tackles Will Campbell and Morgan Moses. Last season, Drake Maye was forced to play behind a porous line that ranked 31st in pass block win rate -- hardly ideal circumstances for a promising quarterback the Patriots hope to develop. Tackles are the most important part of the pass-protecting equation, and with two new ones, the Patriots could turn around their protection in a hurry. Being the No. 4 pick hardly guarantees immediate success (even first-round offensive linemen are below average in their first season), but it means Campbell has a shot to hit the ground running. Moses has been a stable pass protector, which should continue if his age (34) doesn't catch up to him. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Edge rusher K'Lavon Chaisson. A former first-round pick who struggled in his four seasons with the Jaguars, Chaisson finally had a productive year as a part-time edge rusher for Las Vegas last season. He put up 5.0 sacks -- all in the final six games -- and 24 pressures. Was the breakout for real, and how much can Chaisson contribute to the Patriots' pass rush? -- Schatz22. Jacksonville JaguarsBiggest strength: Edge rusher. Josh Hines-Allen has emerged as one of the league's top pass rushers, and 2022 first-overall pick Travon Walker is quickly joining that conversation. Over the past two seasons, Hines-Allen ranks sixth (25.5) and Walker 12th (20.5) leaguewide in total sacks. Depth is also a potential strength, with Dennis Gardeck, Emmanuel Ogbah and Dawuane Smoot all signing on in free agency. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Offensive line. This is the Jags' main concern for the third consecutive season. Tackles Walker Little and Anton Harrison posted poor pass block win rates in each of the past two seasons, and they are expected to start again. The interior will have a bit of a new look. Incumbent left guard Ezra Cleveland will be joined by two newcomers -- center Robert Hainsey and right guard Patrick Mekari. But it's hard to imagine this group making much of a leap. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Rookie wide receiver/cornerback Travis Hunter. In the best-case scenario, Hunter is almost a full-time, two-way player who performs on both sides of the ball right away. In this world, the Jaguars have a formidable one-two punch at receiver (with Brian Thomas Jr.) and at cornerback (with Tyson Campbell). But hitting that parlay is far from a guarantee. If Hunter can't play well on both sides, the Jaguars could have offensive and defensive issues. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Wide receiver Parker Washington. As Seth alluded to, there isn't a lot of receiver depth. If Hunter gets hurt attempting to play both ways and Dyami Brown doesn't pan out, Washington will have to step up. The 2023 sixth-round pick had an average DVOA last season, with 32 receptions for 390 yards and three touchdowns, but he tallied a rough 35 open score in ESPN's receiver tracking metrics. After Washington comes former Ram Austin Trammell, former Bengal Trenton Irwin and other previously unsuccessful agents. -- Schatz23. Las Vegas RaidersBiggest strength: Defensive line. New year, same strength. The Raiders already have Maxx Crosby (seventh in the league with 34.5 sacks and first among edge rushers with 223 tackles over the past three seasons) and get back one of the league's top defensive tackles in Christian Wilkins (fifth among DTs with 9.0 sacks in 2023 before missing all but four games last season). Edge Malcolm Koonce (torn ACL in Week 1 of 2024) will also return, and Las Vegas hopes to get more from 2023 first-round pick Tyree Wilson. Defensive tackle depth behind Watkins and Adam Butler remains a concern, but this unit has plenty of potential. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Secondary. Tre'von Moehrig, Jack Jones and Nate Hobbs ranked first, third and 10th, respectively, among Raiders defenders in snaps played in 2024. None will return in 2025. Eric Stokes, who didn't work out in Green Bay, could be the team's top corner. Jakorian Bennett, Decamerion Richardson, Darnay Holmes and third-round rookie Darien Porter are also competing for starting jobs. At safety, solid journeyman Jeremy Chinn was brought in to replace Moehrig opposite Isaiah Pola-Mao, who graded 37th at PFF among 41 safeties with 900-plus snaps in 2024. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Center Jackson Powers-Johnson. Powers-Johnson split time between guard and center as a rookie. At guard, he ranked fourth in pass block win rate (though this dropped to 20th at center) and sixth in run block win rate (moved up to first at center). Given that first-year linemen typically struggle, there's a chance the Raiders have a star. If they do, that should help new Raiders Geno Smith, Ashton Jeanty and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly work some magic. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Defensive tackle JJ Pegues. In case you haven't heard, this rookie was a 325-pound Wildcat quarterback in college. Oh, and he also had excellent tackling grades from PFF. Alongside do-everything former Montana State quarterback-turned-receiver-turned-return-man Tommy Mellott, there's no doubt the Raiders had the most interesting sixth round of the 2025 draft. -- Schatz24. Miami DolphinsBiggest strength: Wide receiver. Miami's receivers might have underperformed last season, but this Tyreek Hill/Jaylen Waddle-led group is super talented and a good bet for a rebound. Dealing with injuries and two-high safety looks at a league-high rate, Hill plummeted from 1,799 yards and 13 TDs in 2023 to 959 yards and six scores in 2024. Meanwhile, Waddle posted 58 receptions and 744 yards in 15 games after clearing 70 receptions and 1,000 yards in each of his first three NFL seasons. Miami also upgraded its depth by signing Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, who had nine TDs on 32 receptions last season with the Titans. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Secondary. Miami's biggest strength this time last year has become its glaring weakness ... and perhaps one of the league's biggest. Both starting safeties (Jordan Poyer, Jevon Holland) are gone, as well as top corners Kendall Fuller and Jalen Ramsey. Oddly, Miami didn't do much to replace them, adding Artie Burns, Ashtyn Davis and Ifeatu Melifonwu (the trio combined for 468 snaps in 2024). Fifth-rounders Jason Marshall Jr. and Dante Trader Jr. were their only draft selections in the secondary. Slot corner Kader Kohou is pretty good, but the situation around him is a massive question. -- ClayX factor for 2025: The running game. The Dolphins went from the most efficient running game in the league by EPA per play in 2023 to second worst last season. Run blocking played a big part of that (Miami dropped from sixth to 26th in run block win rate), but the running back performance dropped, too. De'Von Achane, Jaylen Wright and Raheem Mostert (now departed) all recorded negative rush yards over expectation, per NFL Next Gen Stats. One way or another, Mike McDaniel will need to get the ground attack back on track. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Linebackers Willie Gay and K.J. Britt. The Dolphins have built great depth at inside linebacker with these former starters. Gay is strong in pass coverage, while Britt had 72 combined tackles for Tampa Bay last season. But you usually play two of these guys at a time, and the Dolphins also have Jordyn Brooks and Tyrel Dodson. Are Gay and Britt more of a luxury for this defense, given its significant holes at other positions? -- Schatz25. Indianapolis ColtsBiggest strength: Interior defensive line. This unit is anchored by DeForest Buckner, one of the league's best defenders. Despite missing five games last season, the 31-year-old has played 550-plus snaps in all eight of his NFL seasons and delivered at least 6.5 sacks in seven consecutive campaigns. He'll be joined in the trenches by underrated run stuffer Grover Stewart, with Neville Gallimore, Adetomiwa Adebawore and Eric Johnson II providing depth. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Quarterback. The fourth pick in 2023, Anthony Richardson Sr. has yet to emerge as a reliable NFL starter because of injuries and ineffectiveness. He is effective with his legs, but erratic passing led to a horrific 48% completion rate last season. The Colts signed Daniel Jones as a fallback, and he could win the Week 1 starting job. Similarly, Jones (who was benched and later cut by the Giants last season) adds value with his legs but struggles as a passer. Jones has yet to clear 6.8 yards per attempt in a season as a pro. -- ClayX factor for 2025: The additions in the secondary, cornerback Charvarius Ward and safety Camryn Bynum. If those two can play at the level of their compensation, there's potential for this unit to step up after allowing 0.10 EPA per dropback last season (23rd best). I'm quite bullish on Ward, who has recorded better-than-average yards per coverage snap allowed in four of the past five seasons. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Cornerback JuJu Brents. A 2023 second-round pick out of Kansas State, Brents hasn't stayed healthy. He had a reasonable performance in half a season as a rookie, then made it into only two games last season. He's a big (6-foot-3) outside cornerback with long arms and press coverage ability, so he should get some playing time opposite Ward. -- Schatz26. Atlanta FalconsBiggest strength: Running back. Bijan Robinson is fresh off a breakout campaign in which he finished top five among backs in snaps, carries, routes, targets, receptions, touches and yards, and added 15 touchdowns (sixth most). The 2023 No. 8 pick is one of the league's top offensive playmakers and has a very good backup in Tyler Allgeier -- his 2.24 yards after catch since being drafted is third best among 52 RBs with 300-plus carries. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Cornerback. The Falcons' cornerbacks have a chance to be fine, but there's no one inspiring after A.J. Terrell. Mike Hughes returns as the No. 2 option after a solid 2024 campaign, Dee Alford is back as the primary slot, and Clark Phillips III is the top reserve on the perimeter. Atlanta didn't make notable additions to a group that allowed the league's highest catch rate while ranking 26th in pass breakups in 2024. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. He was solid in his three starts (in five overall games) last season, with a 51.0 QBR that was almost in line with Kirk Cousins' efficiency as a starter. That's a tiny sample, however, so we should think of Penix as mostly an unknown. The range of outcomes for the Falcons is vast, and it hinges more on Penix's potential. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Defensive lineman Ruke Orhorhoro. The Falcons traded up to take Orhorhoro in the second round of the 2024 draft, but injuries limited him to eight games in his rookie season, and he's not penciled in to start in Year 2. Draftniks thought he was a quick, quality bull rusher who could also be stout against the run. Atlanta needs to be better on the interior after finishing 26th in run stop win rate last season, and a step forward from Orhorhoro -- enough to challenge Morgan Fox and Ta'Quon Graham for a starting spot -- would be a big help. -- Schatz27. New York GiantsBiggest strength: Defensive front. The Giants still have many major roster concerns, but they might have the league's best defensive front. It starts at edge rusher with arguably the league's most intimidating trio. Brian Burns is seventh in the NFL with 54.5 sacks since entering the league in 2019, Kayvon Thibodeaux ranks 21st with 17.0 over the past two seasons, and, as if that's not enough, New York spent the third pick of April's draft on Abdul Carter. The Giants' D-Line also features one of the league's top defensive tackles in Dexter Lawrence II (second-team All-Pro in 2022 and 2023). -- ClayBiggest weakness: Offensive line. The Giants are set to return all five starters from 2024, but that might not be a good thing. LT Andrew Thomas is very good, but he has missed substantial game action in recent seasons and doesn't have a ton of help. LG Jon Runyan, C John Michael Schmitz Jr., RG Greg Van Roten and RT Jermaine Eluemunor all posted below-average-to-poor PFF grades and run block win rates last season, with all three interior linemen ranking bottom 20 in the latter stat among 92 qualified players. The draft provided minimal help, as fifth-round guard Marcus Mbow was the only OL investment. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Safety Tyler Nubin. Despite being a rookie, Nubin led all defensive backs in run stop win rate last season among those with at least 50 qualifying plays. Now, he'll be paired with Jevon Holland, an experienced safety who had success in Miami. If Nubin takes another step, Holland meets expectations and cornerback Paulson Adebo succeeds in his first season in New York, you can start to see how the back end of this defense could come together. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Cornerback Cor'Dale Flott. Flott started 10 games last season but has been pushed to the bench because of the addition of Adebo. Flott's coverage DVOA ranked 60th among qualifying cornerbacks, but he got better as the season went along. Flott is looking for the opportunity to play more this season and earn a second contract somewhere, as his rookie deal is about to end. -- Schatz28. Tennessee TitansBiggest strength: Interior defensive line. Jeffery Simmons is one of the league's best, and his 26.5 sacks over the past four seasons ranks sixth among interior linemen. It appears Tennessee found a gem on Day 2 of last year's draft, as T'Vondre Sweat was terrific as a rookie, posting PFF's 13th-highest grade among 89 qualified DTs. Veteran Sebastian Joseph-Day is returning and will help fill out the terrific trio. -- ClayBiggest weakness: The rest of the front seven. Edge Harold Landry III (second among Titans' defenders in snaps last season) and linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr. (fourth) were among Tennessee's notable offseason departures. That leaves Arden Key (career-high 6.5 sacks last season) as the team's top edge, with a host of newcomers (Dre'Mont Jones, Lorenzo Carter and second-round rookie Oluwafemi Oladejo) competing for a prominent workload. Linebacker Cody Barton is on his fourth team in four years, but he has registered 100-plus tackles each of the past three seasons. Though Barton could solidify things, no other LB on the roster played more than 140 snaps last season. -- ClayX factor for 2025: The offensive line. This is a roundabout answer to developing rookie quarterback Cameron Ward, but there's a wide range of outcomes for this group. New left tackle Dan Moore Jr. is coming off a solid pass protection season with the Steelers but has been unreliable. Left guard Peter Skoronski is a young, ascending player, while Lloyd Cushenberry III has been a good pass-protecting center recently but ranked last in pass block win rate there last year. Guard Kevin Zeitler is always good, but he is 35. Second-year man JC Latham was OK in pass protection last season at left tackle, but he's moving to right tackle. So, the upside is there, but there's downside, too. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Cornerback Darrell Baker Jr. A journeyman on his third NFL team, Baker was a shocking No. 1 in coverage DVOA last season among qualifying cornerbacks. But his numbers were strange across the board. He had an average yards-per-target figure, and gave up a high number of YAC when he allowed a reception. However, Baker was rarely targeted when he was on the field. Was he doing something right, or is this a case of small sample size (Baker barely qualified for the rankings) and opponents picking on other Tennessee corners? If L'Jarius Sneed gets injured again, the Titans will find out. -- Schatz29. New York JetsBiggest strength: Cornerback. This group isn't as good as in years past, but it's still likely the Jets' best unit. Sauce Gardner battled injuries last season, but the 24-year-old remains one of the league's best corners, having been a first-team All-Pro in 2022 and 2023. Brandon Stephens, who paced the Ravens in defensive snaps played over the past two seasons, was brought in to replace D.J. Reed and should be a solid running mate for Gardner. Michael Carter II, one of the league's best slot corners, is eyeing a rebound campaign after an injury-plagued 2024. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Quarterback. The Jets replaced Aaron Rodgers with Justin Fields during the offseason, and it has yet to be determined if the latter can establish himself as an impact NFL starter. Fields, who was benched after six starts in Pittsburgh last season, has a career 47.1 QBR, which ranks 29th out of 34 qualified QBs during the span. He's a high-impact player as a rusher, but hasn't finished a season with 2,600 yards or 18 TDs through the air. Tyrod Taylor returns as the fallback option. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Tackles Olu Fashanu and Armand Membou. Fashanu ranked 43rd out of 66 tackles in pass block win rate (88%) as a rookie, but both tackles have the chance to be plus starters. Fields has been known to take a sack (or three), and good (or not) pass protection could be the difference between this offense being efficient (or not). -- WalderNonstarter to know: Center Josh Myers. He was a starter for the past three seasons in Green Bay, but Myers signed a one-year deal in New York to be a backup. It seems like a strange decision, but Myers gives the Jets fantastic depth if there are injuries at any of the three interior line positions. -- Schatz30. Carolina PanthersBiggest strength: Wide receiver. There's some projection here, but receiver should be this team's strength. Carolina boosted the position on draft day by selecting Tetairoa McMillan with the No. 8 pick. He'll join 2024 first-round pick Xavier Legette and gem 2024 UDFA find Jalen Coker on the perimeter, with reliable Adam Thielen (eighth in the NFL with 665 receptions since 2017) back for more at age 35. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Safety. Xavier Woods, who led the defense in snaps last season, is gone and will be replaced by free agent signing Tre'von Moehrig. That could be an upgrade, but the rest of the team's safety situation is uncertain, with Nick Scott, Demani Richardson and fourth-round rookie Lathan Ransom competing for snaps. Neither Scott nor Richardson impressed with limited snaps last season, and the Panthers allowed 6.94 yards per dropback -- second worst in the league. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Rookie edge rusher Nic Scourton. If Scourton doesn't immediately threaten the quarterback, the Panthers will be in trouble in terms of outside pass rush. D.J. Wonnum, DJ Johnson and Pat Jones II are the other options, and none appear likely to cause much disruption. That places a key role on second-rounder Scourton. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Coker. The UDFA didn't make the Panthers' roster until late September, but he finished the season ranked 19th among qualifying wide receivers in the ESPN Receiver Tracking Metrics and had an 83-yard touchdown against the Cowboys in December. He's no longer a starter, but he'll still play a role in the Panthers' offense and could blossom if someone ahead of him gets hurt. -- Schatz31. Cleveland BrownsBiggest strength: Edge rusher. Four-time All-Pro and 2023 Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett carries this group, having posted 60-plus pass rush wins and 12.0-plus sacks in five consecutive seasons. The depth isn't as strong as in years past, but there are plenty of candidates for significant work, including Alex Wright, Isaiah McGuire, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and Julian Okwara. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Quarterback. They say that if you have two starting quarterbacks, you have zero starting QBs. So what if you have four? Cleveland will roll out a rare, full-on competition between four underwhelming candidates: Joe Flacco, 40, journeyman Kenny Pickett, third-round rookie Dillon Gabriel and fifth-round flier Shedeur Sanders. Perhaps one of the rookies will be a gem, but it's hard to see much upside. -- ClayX factor for 2025: The entire rookie class. Cleveland is not a contender in 2025, so the Browns' focus should be on developing their young players into starters or stars. The highest-upside spot is with Gabriel and Sanders -- the sooner one of them pushes Flacco or Pickett for playing time, the better. But the QBs are long shots, and this philosophy extends to the rest of the class. Can Mason Graham be a stalwart of this defensive line for many years? Is Quinshon Judkins the Nick Chubb successor? These questions matter more than wins and losses for the Browns this season. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Linebacker Mohamoud Diabate. We expect new addition Jerome Baker to start ahead of Diabate, but the 2023 UDFA was surprisingly productive in 2024. Baker made his average run tackle after a gain of 2.7 yards, which ranked fourth best among qualifying linebackers. He was also good in pass coverage DVOA and added seven pressures on blitzes. -- Schatz32. New Orleans SaintsBiggest strength: Edge rusher. Carl Granderson has emerged as one of the league's most underrated pass rushers. His 139 tackles over the past two seasons are the third most at the position, and he has had 14 sacks, too. Chase Young ranked 16th in the league with 21 QB hits last season. Cameron Jordan, 36, played a smaller role last season, but he still leads the NFL with 120.5 sacks since 2012. Isaiah Foskey (2023 second-rounder) adds depth. -- ClayBiggest weakness: Quarterback. Derek Carr's sudden retirement has left the Saints in rebuild mode under center. Second-round rookie Tyler Shough is the best bet to emerge as a viable starter, and perhaps he'll be more pro-ready than most first-year QBs, considering he's 25 years old. Recent Day 3 fliers, Spencer Rattler and Jake Haener, both struggled in relief of Carr last season. -- ClayX factor for 2025: Tackles Kelvin Banks Jr. and Taliese Fuaga. The latter struggled in pass protection as a rookie at left tackle, recording an 84% pass block win rate that ranked 57th out of 66 qualifying tackles. But this season, Fuaga is moving to his college position of right tackle. If he can improve, and if Banks can be decent in Year 1, the Saints could be looking at a long future with their tackles in place. Those are big \"ifs,\" though. -- WalderNonstarter to know: Running back Kendre Miller. Miller was well-regarded for his size-speed combination when the Saints took him in the third round of the 2023 draft. Injuries have kept him off the field for much of the past two seasons -- he has played only 14 games with 80 carries, 304 yards and 2 touchdowns in that span. Alvin Kamara will be 30 years old this season, so there might be an opportunity if Miller can stay healthy. He'll compete for playing time with veterans Cam Akers and Clyde Edwards-Helaire, plus sixth-round rookie Devin Neal. -- Schatz</p>"

      "content": "<p>Brooke PryorCloseBrooke PryorESPN Staff WriterBrooke Pryor is a reporter for NFL Nation at ESPN who has covered the Pittsburgh Steelers since 2019. She previously covered the Kansas City Chiefs for the Kansas City Star and the University of Oklahoma for The Oklahoman.Stephen HolderCloseStephen HolderESPNStephen joined ESPN in 2022, covering the Indianapolis Colts and NFL at large. Stephen finished first place in column writing in the 2015 Indiana Associated Press Media Editors competition, and he is a previous top-10 winner in explanatory journalism in the Associated Press Sports Editors national contest. He has chronicled the NFL since 2005, covering the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2005-2013 and the Colts since 2013. He has previously worked for the Miami Herald, Tampa Bay Times, Indianapolis Star and The Athletic.Jul 21, 2025, 06:10 AM ETThough it's technically the offseason, there has been plenty of action around the league in the five months since confetti rained down on the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans.It was a stretch marked by new coaches, new quarterbacks and old rules. And, of course, it's not an offseason without a little Aaron Rodgers drama.NFL Nation reporters Brooke Pryor and Stephen Holder help you catch up on everything you might've missed -- or forgotten about -- as the league's 32 teams report to training camp and officially kick off the preseason.New addressesThere's going to be a lot of mail rerouted to and from Pittsburgh after this offseason. Typically a quiet team in free agency and the trade market, the Steelers bucked tradition as general manager Omar Khan spent the last couple of months wheeling and dealing. Hours before free agency's legal tampering period began, Khan got a head start on the Steelers' roster overhaul by trading for Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf.Since then, the Steelers have been a revolving door of roster transactions. They signed cornerback Darius Slay and Rodgers (more on him later), traded for cornerback Jalen Ramsey and tight end Jonnu Smith, and shipped off safety Minkah Fitzpatrick to the Miami Dolphins and wide receiver George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys.Believe it or not, teams other than Pittsburgh also made significant moves during the offseason. Quarterback Geno Smith was the first domino to fall when he was acquired by the Las Vegas Raiders from Seattle on March 7. From there, the Seahawks signed Sam Darnold to a three-year, $100.5 million contract, while former New York Giants first-round pick Daniel Jones signed with the Indianapolis Colts to compete with Anthony Richardson Sr. for the starting job. Former Steelers quarterbacks Justin Fields and Russell Wilson both headed to New York, though Fields went to the Jets and Wilson signed with the Giants.Wide receivers were on the move, too, including Stefon Diggs signing with the New England Patriots, Deebo Samuel Sr. traded to the Washington Commanders, Cooper Kupp to the Seahawks and Davante Adams landing with the Los Angeles Rams. -- PryorNew coaches galoreNearly a fourth of NFL teams swapped coaches this year, with seven franchises making changes in 2025.Among the biggest was the long-awaited move by former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, who was in demand last year but opted to hold out for the right opportunity. That brought him to Chicago, where this season he'll lead the Bears and quarterback Caleb Williams in hopes the team can fulfill its high expectations. It'll be no small feat if Johnson, who coordinated a prolific offense in Detroit, can unlock Williams' potential and get the Bears on track. Chicago has still never had a 4,000-yard passer, but Johnson will try to make Williams its first.The return to the game of two accomplished former coaches -- Mike Vrabel with the New England Patriots and Pete Carroll with the Raiders -- will be a couple storylines worth monitoring. The pair had unceremonious exits from their former teams -- the Tennessee Titans and Seahawks, respectively -- and now they're being tasked with turning around two teams that each won four games last season. Are they up for the challenge?One of the most-watched situations in 2025 will be in Dallas, where the Cowboys promoted former offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to head coach. Can he achieve better postseason results than his predecessors for a team that has managed just two postseason victories in the past 10 seasons?Other new coaches include Liam Cohen with the Jacksonville Jaguars -- after his controversial exit from Tampa Bay -- Aaron Glenn with the New York Jets and Kellen Moore with the New Orleans Saints. -- HolderThe tush push lives!Rarely has the NFL's sausage making become as public and as intriguing as it did during the spring debate over the future of the so-called tush push.Ultimately, the highly successful short-yardage play perfected by the Philadelphia Eagles survived in the face of those who wished to ban it. A rule proposal that would have specifically outlawed the play failed to pass at the league's annual meeting in March. Then, a revamped proposal that was seen as more palatable -- it was designed to prohibit pushing ball carriers from behind in all scenarios -- also failed at the league's May meeting. That measure fell short by two votes.The whole situation produced substantial debate among owners and executives, with ESPN reporting in May that Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie delivered a passionate, hour-long speech during a closed-door meeting defending the play. Then, he enlisted former Eagles center Jason Kelce to add additional context and to address injury concerns that helped fuel the effort to outlaw the play.Lurie reportedly criticized commissioner Roger Goodell during his speech for advocating for the ban. It all became somewhat personal because another team, the Green Bay Packers, was proposing a rule change that largely targeted a single team, the Eagles. That put the Eagles on the defensive.\"I don't think it's a great football play,\" Packers coach Matt LeFleur said. \"It's more of a rugby play.\"But, for now, quarterback Jalen Hurts and the Eagles may push to their hearts' content. Philadelphia has run the play 124 times since 2022 and has a conversion rate of 85.5%.Elsewhere, the kickoff remained fluid this offseason. After last year's significant change to the \"dynamic kickoff\" approach, owners approved a small change they hope will have a major impact. For 2025, kickoffs that result in touchbacks will give the offense possession at the 35-yard line as opposed to the 30. The change, NFL owners hope, will increase the rate of kickoff returns from the 32.8% of kicks that were returned last season -- a disappointing number that fell well short of what NFL officials had envisioned. Teams may be less inclined to kick the ball into the end zone knowing a touchback will start at the 35.Overtime procedures were also tweaked for 2025, with the NFL now adopting in the regular season its postseason approach of guaranteeing both teams the opportunity to possess the ball in the extra period. Previously, regular-season games ended if a team scored a touchdown on the opening possession of overtime.Finally, replay assist will be expanded this season, providing greater latitude by replay officials to address specific calls without a coach's challenge when \"clear and obvious\" video evidence is available. -- HolderAnother Rodgers saga\"As Aaron Rodgers' Mind Turns\" was the soap opera of the offseason. Again. Released by the Jets after a tumultuous two-year tenure, Rodgers hit free agency for the first time in his career in March.Though he was quickly linked to the Steelers, Rodgers maximized his time as an unattached player by taking more than three months to officially decide against retirement and sign with the team. He inked a one-year, $13.65 million contract just prior to the team's minicamp in early June, and he promised his new teammates that he was \"all in.\"\"I don't need it for my ego,\" the four-time MVP said at minicamp. \"I don't need it to keep playing. A lot of decisions that I've made over my career and life from strictly the ego, even if they turn out well, are always unfulfilling. But the decisions made from the soul are usually pretty fulfilling.\"This was a decision that was best for my soul, and I felt like being here with coach [Mike Tomlin] and the guys that got here and the opportunity here was the best for me, and I'm excited to be here.\"Though Rodgers showed his commitment to playing football this season, he admitted it will likely be his last in an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show.\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is it,\" Rodgers said. \"That's why we just did a one-year deal. Steelers didn't need to put any extra years on that or anything, so this was really about finishing with a lot of love and fun and peace for the career that I've had.While Rodgers has one more year to chase another Super Bowl, he already added one ring this year: a wedding ring. The 41-year-old quarterback confirmed he's been wearing a wedding ring on his left hand after getting married earlier in the offseason. -- PryorNFLPA chaosInstead of fighting the NFL on behalf of its players, the NFL Players Association in recent months found itself consumed by internal strife.Following a series of revelations, executive director Lloyd Howell resigned after two years on the job last week. Lloyd, in a statement, said his \"leadership has become a distraction to the important work the NFLPA advances.\"The growing number of problems facing the union under Howell became too much to ignore. In May, ESPN reported that the FBI was investigating the financial dealings of the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association with a group-licensing firm, OneTeam Partners. That prompted the NFLPA to hire an outside law firm to review Howell's activities. The FBI investigation is ongoing, sources told ESPN.Word later emerged that Howell was working as a part-time consultant for the Carlyle Group, a private-equity firm that is seeking ownership stakes in NFL teams. That raised questions about a possible conflict of interest. Howell also faced scrutiny over a confidentiality agreement with the NFL earlier this year that hid from players the details of an arbitration decision that found that NFL executives urged team owners to reduce guaranteed money in player contracts.Additionally, ESPN reported recently that Howell was sued for sexual discrimination and retaliation in 2011 while he served as an executive at consulting firm Booz Allen. There remains ambiguity about whether players who voted for him during the 2023 election for executive director knew about the lawsuit.On Friday, ESPN reported that an outside investigator reviewing Howell's activities found improper expenses charged to the organization, including car service trips to a strip club.And over the weekend, NFLPA chief strategy officer JC Tretter announced he is resigning from his position and has withdrawn himself from consideration for the NFLPA's interim executive director position.A story to watch going forward is the NFLPA's appeal of the collusion case related to conversations around reducing salary guarantees. The arbitrator ruled against the NFLPA but did find that \"concerted action was contemplated and invited\" by league executives. -- HolderOther headlinesBack up the Brinks truck: It was a good offseason to be a pass rusher up for an extension. Maxx Crosby, Myles Garrett and T.J. Watt all took turns being the highest-paid non-quarterback in the league as they agreed to lucrative extensions. As the last one of the three to finalize his deal, Watt currently owns the highest-paid title with an average annual salary of $41 million.And pass rusher wasn't the only position to get a raise this offseason. Fresh off his first MVP season, Bills quarterback Josh Allen was rewarded with a brand new six-year contract that will pay him $330 million with $250 million guaranteed.Super Bowl-winning running back Saquon Barkley was also paid for his accomplishments with a two-year, $41.2 million contract. The Jets also worked out lucrative extensions for wide receiver Garrett Wilson and cornerback Sauce Gardner, and the Lions made Kerby Joseph the highest-paid safety in the league with a four-year, $86 million deal. And while the Bengals secured their explosive wide receiver duo in Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, they're still at a stalemate with 2024 sack leader Trey Hendrickson. -- PryorThe Shedeur slide: Once considered a first-round pick candidate, Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders had an unprecedented draft slide to Day 3 before he was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round.Sanders was the second quarterback drafted by the Browns after they picked Oregon's Dillon Gabriel in the third round. The Browns also have veterans Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco competing for the starting job.Travis Hunter, however, didn't have the same problem as his former Colorado teammate. The two-way Heisman winner went to Jacksonville after the Jaguars traded up with the Browns to snag him at No. 2 overall, and he's expected to play both ways in the NFL. -- PryorHappy trails: Former Saints and Raiders quarterback Derek Carr, 34, announced his retirement in May following pain in his throwing shoulder during his first extensive throwing session of the offseason. Imaging showed Carr had a torn right labrum and \"significant degenerative changes to his rotator cuff.\"Wide receiver Mike Williams, defensive end Brandon Graham and tackle Tyron Smith also all announced retirements. -- PryorLaw and order: Vikings receiver Jordan Addison resolved a 2024 DUI case by pleading no contest to a lesser charge, according to his attorney. The adjudication resulted in a sentence of 12 months of probation that could be reduced to six months if Addison fulfills other obligations.Elsewhere, Chiefs receiver Rashee Rice was sentenced to 30 days in jail and five years probation for a 2024 chain-reaction, high-speed crash that resulted in injuries on a Dallas expressway. Rice, who pleaded guilty to two third-degree felonies, will be allowed to serve the jail time at any point during the probationary period. Police said Rice was traveling at 119 mph just before the crash occurred.Both players are subject to NFL suspensions now that their cases are resolved. -- Holder</p>"

After Arsenal's reported efforts to sign Sesko collapsed, United now look poised to re-enter the race in their search for a new No. 9. Jackson, meanwhile, has fallen down the pecking order at Chelsea following the arrival of Liam Delap and João Pedro. United have already signed Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Matheus Cunha or £62.5m this summer, while a £65m move for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is also close to completion.- Liverpool are attempting to sign Real Madrid winger Rodrygo as the club face the prospect of losing Luis Díaz this summer, AS reports. The Reds are reported to be seeking \"revenge\" on Madrid after losing out on signing the likes of Jude Bellingham and Aurélien Tchouaméni down the years. With fierce competition for places at Los Blancos, Rodrygo has been heavily linked with a move away from the Bernabéu. Arsenal were reportedly keen, while Saudi Arabia also remains a potential destination for the Brazil international. Liverpool, meanwhile, view Rodrygo as a direct replacement for left winger Díaz, who is wanted by Bayern Munich and Barcelona.- A \"verbal pact\" has been made between Galatasaray and Napoli over the transfer of Victor Osimhen, says Fabrizio Romano. Documents are expected to be exchanged in the next 24 hours, in a deal that will see Gala pay €40m now, €35, in a year's time, and 10% profit on any future transfers. Another stipulation of the deal is that Osimhen can' join another Italian club for two years. The 26-year-old's permanent transfer to Galatasaray is expected see Álvaro Morata to join Como later this week.- Arsenal have re-entered the race to sign Atalanta winger Ademola Lookman, TEAMtalk reports. The Gunners are \"long-term admirers\" of Lookman, who is also wanted by Atlético Madrid and Inter Milan this summer. The latter has already had a €40m bid rejected to sign or the Nigeria international, as it fell €10m shy of Atalanta's desired fee. Lookman, 27, enjoyed an impressive campaign in Serie A last season, scoring 15 goals in 31 league outings.- Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal have started talks with Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak over a possible £130m deal, says L'Equipe. Liverpool are also in the race to sign the Sweden international, though look to be closing in on an £80m deal to sign Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitiké instead. Meanwhile, Isak's agent has claimed that his client is \"close to finalizing\" his next step.CONFIRMED DEALSTo follow...EXPERT TAKEESPN's Mark Ogden on Man United's search for another striker.Manchester United need a center forward, but they need plenty of other reinforcements too, so after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves and being on the verge of completing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, other priorities will be addressed before potentially adding a third new recruit to Ruben Amorim's forward line.Amorim highlighted his concerns about United's midfield options following the goalless draw against Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday, so expect that to be the next area that the club seek to address. But having missed out on Ipswich striker Liam Delap following his decision to join Chelsea, it is clear that United have a desire to find an upgrade on the ineffective Ramus Hojlund.Chelsea's Jackson and Leipzig's Sesko are both available at the right price this summer and it is no secret that United have looked at Sesko in the past, with the Slovenia international targeted prior to his move from FC Salzburg to Leipzig two years ago. Sesko has an €80m release clause at Leipzig, as reported by Sky Germany, but United have made a deliberate shift towards signing players with Premier League experience this summer and a move for Sesko, who is still just 22, could be regarded as a gamble at a time when United don't have the funds to risk on a player who 'could' be a success.At 24, Jackson is more experienced and he has proven his Premier League credentials with Chelsea over the past two years. The arrival of Delap and Pedro at Stamford Bridge this summer has placed his Chelsea future in doubt and, with the newly-crowned world champions needing to raise funds by offloading players, a deal could be struck for Jackson. But right now, United have other business to focus on, so much will depend on whether Jackson -- or Sesko -- is available when United return to attacking options later in the window.OTHER RUMORSplay1:54Marcotti doesn't understand Juventus' interest in Jadon SanchoGab Marcotti is unsure Jadon Sancho is the player Juventus should be looking at right now.- Real Madrid are considering a move to sign Arsenal defender William Saliba, though it won't come cheap.

It was also the sixth time in the past seven games in which Messi has scored two goals.\"The reality is we had five games in the last two weeks, four of which were away. It is a complicated stage, especially because of the travel and the lack of rest between games,\" Miami coach Javier Mascherano said after the match. \"The game against Cincinnati was a reflection of the exhaustion the team carries, but now we have a long week. We will use it to give rest to those who are more tired, and with the expectation to recover a couple players that are injured and add them to the roster.\"The Red Bulls (9-9-6, 33 points) failed to string together consecutive wins at home and lost to Inter Miami for the second time this season. Mascherano's team is in fifth place in the Eastern Conference, six points behind Philadelphia, but have three games in hand due to its participation in the Club World Cup this summer.New York scored its lone goal in the 15th minute when Emil Forsberg lifted a corner kick in front of Miami goalkeeper Rocco Rios Novo's line of sight.

Segovia, though, surged in and fired a shot off a rebound past Carlos Miguel Coronel for a third goal.Messi followed with goals in the 60th and 75th minutes to seal the outcome, to the delight of the scores of Miami supporters in the stands despite it being a road game.\"No, it's not a surprise [to see the madness that Messi causes] because I have been with him for eight years at Barca and 15 with Argentina,\" Mascherano said. \"Especially in places where he doesn't go with continuity people go crazy. I have seen it in airports, hotels, he generates this everywhere. I don't think it's only because of his football talent, but because of his admiration as an athlete and the way he's transcended football.\"Leo Messi, Michael Jordan, Rafa Nadal, these are people that have transcended the sport. We are very privileged the people that are close and can witness this.\"Messi increased his total goals in MLS games to 18 this season and has contributed on 27 scores.

Barça had made signing a left winger their priority this summer, as Deco first told ESPN in May, and also moved for Nico Williams and Luis Díaz.Williams ended up renewing his contact with Athletic Club, though, while Liverpool knocked back their approach for Díaz.Rashford has been on the table since January, when he ended up joining Aston Villa on loan, and sources have highlighted his desire to join Barça.He is also a more affordable option than Williams and Díaz, given he arrives on loan rather than for a significant fee.Reports suggest he has also taken a substantial salary cut to push through the move, but sources at Barça wouldn't comment on contractual issues.The England international arrives looking to kick-start his career after a difficult spell at United.He spent the last two weeks training away from the first-team squad at United after being told by coach Ruben Amorim that he does not feature in his plans at Old Trafford.He has not played for United since facing Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League last December, with Amorim dropping the player for the 2-1 Premier League win at Manchester City and not considering him for first-team duty again.A six-month loan to Villa failed to develop into a permanent transfer at a pre-agreed fee of £40 million ($53.6m), but sources have said that Rashford has always preferred a move to Barça after the possibility of such a transfer emerged in January.He will now boost an attack at Barça that already features Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski, Ferran Torres and Dani Olmo.</p>"

England vs. Sweden had the weirdest penalty shootout ever</p>\n\n<p>- Women's Euro 2025 bracket, results and fixtures scheduleSemifinal successplay1:00Marsden: England will breathe 'huge sigh of relief' after penalties winSam Marsden reacts to England's penalty shootout win over Sweden that puts the holders in the Women's Euro 2025 semifinals.The 2015 World Cup in Canada was start of the \"Bronze Age\" (it was only Bronze's second major tournament) and, as England reached World Cup semifinal for the first time, she played on the left wing, right back, scored a thunderbolt winner against Norway in the round of 16, and netted a key header against Canada in the quarterfinals. England went on to lose to Japan in the semifinals, but came third, overcoming perennial foes Germany 1-0 in extra time in the third-place playoff. It proved to be one of the launchpad moments for this team.The Lionesses then also reached the semifinals of Euro 2017, where they lost 3-0 to Netherlands (who were under the management of Sarina Wiegman); one player from that team told ESPN that the secret behind their progress in both tournaments was down to \"pure fight\" and a \"complete underdog mentality.\"But by the time of the 2019 World Cup in France, England were no longer underdogs and went into it with high expectations and an experienced squad. They put in their best performance of the tournament in the 3-0 quarterfinal win over Norway, but then ran into the United States in the semifinal, where a missed penalty and a tea-cup celebration sent them home. By this point, the investment in the team -- then managed by Phil Neville -- was rising every year; the training facilities were improving, the money on offer in the Women's Super League was increasing each year, and the footballing superpower we know now was starting to take shape.When Wiegman took charge of England in 2021, all that hard work paid off and she was unequivocal in the way she felt England should be. Off the pitch, she banned the players from wearing jewelry while playing football as it affected their training metrics; messaging to the players was direct, with little room for ambiguity. On the field, she switched captain from Steph Houghton to Leah Williamson and her experience of winning major tournaments led to England dancing to the sound of \"Sweet, Caroline\" after winning Euro 2022 on home soil.That experience was key a year later as England reached the final of the 2023 World Cup, losing 1-0 to Spain. Once again, Bronze starred on the field, but was also their spokesperson off it when needed.\"If we hadn't have got to the semifinals, I would have said we would have underperformed,\" she said at the time. \"Our performances haven't been our best, granted, but the results have been there ... We got past the hurdle last year in the Euros and finally made it to the final. We got past that dreaded [feeling of] always being beaten in the semifinals so we've got that in the locker.\"The 'why' is the motivatorAs England prepare for their sixth major semifinal in 10 years after a tense buildup of retirements and negative press, Bronze is still there. And still leading from the front.Before the tournament started, each player sat down and told the other 22 in the squad why they want to play for England and what has driven them to this point. On the wall of the team room in their camp at the Dolder Grand hotel in Zurich, the players have a photo of them as youngsters, but another of them from their England journey. Bronze's is from the third-place match at the 2019 World Cup (a game England lost 2-1 to Sweden, where she looked utterly exhausted.\"I will give anything, and I will give everything when I play in an England shirt,\" Bronze says of why she chose that photo. \"I wanted all the girls to know that that's my 'why.' My 'why' is to give everything for this team because I just love playing for England so much.\"After the opening-game loss to France, she addressed her teammates again and reminded them how they lost their first match back in 2015 and ended up reaching the semifinals. All was not lost, and they trusted one another to respond.\"I think we've made ourselves very vulnerable, whether it's individually, as Sarina herself has made herself very vulnerable, staff, players,\" England forward Beth Mead said to the BBC. \"I think that gives us so much more togetherness, so much more trust of each other, that we're willing to share really tough moments with each other. How can we help each other in those moments?\"I'm super proud of how we've actually dealt with that as a squad. In the past, I feel like maybe teams that I have been a part of might not have been able to do that so positively and quickly in hard moments.\"I really think that Sarina has instilled that into us as a team, and we know she's got our back, we've got her back and you can see that in the way, obviously, we have come back in performances and it's not gone quite right and we've still, you know, given that 'Proper England' attitude.\"Unity is holding England togetherplay1:21Laurens: Italy will be fine with underdogs tag vs. EnglandJulien Laurens previews the first semifinal at Women's Euro 2025 as surprise-package Italy take on defending champions England.\"Proper England\" has been England's mantra in Switzerland and that theme of togetherness has been fundamental to their run to yet another semifinal.The \"positive clicks\" clique -- the group the substitutes have formed to keep spirits high, and intensity at a level where they are ready to jump into action whenever needed -- has been key. We saw that against Netherlands where England had to win to avoid going out after only their second match (and did so, 4-0), then against Wales where England prevailed 6-1, and then in that helter-skelter quarterfinal against Sweden that saw them come back from 2-0 down with the help of their subs to progress on a penalty shootout that saw nine misses. They needed a huge slice of luck, but it's unity which has carried them forward.We've seen that togetherness on show again in the last couple of days. On Sunday, defender Jess Carter released a statement where she talked about the racist abuse she's been subject to through the tournament. The players responded with a collective message; supporting Carter, condemning the abuse she's received and announcing that they'd no longer take the knee before matches.- Carter subject to racist abuse at Euro 2025</p>\n\n<p>- England 'angry' about Carter racist abuse - BronzeOnce more, it was Bronze who fronted up to the media. She spoke brilliantly for 20-odd minutes as she left the world in no doubt over the anger and sadness the Lionesses felt at the racist abuse Carter received. But also how they would stand together.\"We're all very professional and able to focus on football whilst supporting each other,\" she said. \"We all support Jess; Jess supports the team. No matter what we're all going through we're all able to do that and I think we've shown that in this tournament and in previous tournaments, in previous meetings with different players going through different scenarios whether it's something going on at home, deaths of parents, to racism, to homophobia.\"There's so many issues that go on, this team stand up and speak out for and we all support each other through all, and whilst we're doing that we're still successful as a football team and I think that's what gives us this platform to be able to speak out and to push even more.\"Moments like that empower us both off the pitch and on the pitch, so for us it's about how we're empowered as players to make a change and know that driving for success will help us make those changes.\"Make no mistake, England will be emotionally charged when they face Italy on Tuesday in Geneva. On the field, they'll be keeping everything crossed that Williamson is fit to face Italy after she turned her ankle against Sweden, and they'll be hoping the performance is more akin to Netherlands and Wales than France and Sweden.If it was collective fight which got them through to their first-ever World Cup semifinal back in 2015, it's been the \"proper England\" mentality and the strength of the pack this time around. And it's also been Bronze. \"She just sort of put her shoulders back and played like, 'I'm not letting us go home,'\" Morgan said of her teammate against Sweden.England have embraced a mentality of winning matches at whatever personal cost, but also ensuring that if one member of the squad is hurting, the rest of the pack rallies around them. And it's what has them on the verge of yet another final.</p>"

Surprise picks Italy complete the quartet, setting up another tasty round of fixtures.But who will emerge victorious and make it to the final? Here are the strengths and weaknesses of the teams.SEMIFINALSTuesday</p>\n\n<p>Italy vs. England (9 p.m., Geneva)Wednesday</p>\n\n<p>Spain vs. Germany (9 p.m., Zurich)England: Struggles at the backplay1:00Marsden: England will breathe 'huge sigh of relief' after penalties winSam Marsden reacts to England's penalty shootout win over Sweden that puts the holders in the Women's Euro 2025 semifinals.Tactical substitutions took center stage as Sarina Wiegman's side overcame a 2-0 deficit against Sweden. The formation switch from a back four to a back three, with Michelle Agyemang and Alessia Russo as the front two, helped England pin Sweden's center backs and cause problems.The defending champions have been adaptable to different situations in their four games so far. After their opening day defeat against France, England rejiggered their backline, switching Jess Carter from left back to center back.The introduction of Ella Toone added dynamism in the attack, which resulted in 10 goals in the following two games. Though this papered over the cracks, teams started targeting Carter's side to create opportunities.A lot of England's problems have emerged in their own half. Wiegman's side has committed the most errors leading to shots in the tournament thus far (8), highlighting instability. Their games against France and Sweden underlined the problems dealing with press while building out the back. Sweden created a lot of high turnovers against the Lionesses, also resulting in their opening goal.England's buildup has had its own set of problems. With the passage to metronome Keira Walsh in midfield often blocked, England are forced to play long balls or pick riskier options to progress possession. This results in a lot of blocked passes and a low passing accuracy on forward balls in their own half. No side has had more passes blocked than England in the tournament (50).Italy: The problem of through-ballsplay0:40Italy embracing 'underdog' label vs. EnglandItaly defender Martina Lenzini believes in her team despite being considered underdogs ahead of their game against England at Euro 2025.Andrea Soncin's Italy scripted history by reaching their first semifinal at a major tournament since 1997. Experienced Juventus striker Cristiana Girelli scored twice to stage a comeback against an uninspiring Norway.Italy's campaign has been gritty. They have showcased their best and their worst, often at the same time. Le Azzurre have scored a goal in each of their four games so far, though they have only scored multiple goals once and lack real goal-scoring options apart from Girelli.Italy have resorted to a direct style, finding the vertical outlet with a long ball. Only England (215) have completed more long balls than Italy (153), but Le Azzurre boast the best long-ball completion rate in the tournament (60.1%).Soncin's side has played direct balls to Girelli, who has shown imperious aerial ability. She has won the most aerial duels in the tournament (15) and has a 79% win rate.The problems for Italy persist in gaps in defense. Soncin's side has shapeshifted between using a back four and a back five interchangeably during the game. Switching has often left gaps behind the wing backs, who are pushed high to support attacking play.Teams have targeted this space with incisive passing. No side has conceded more through-balls than Italy in the competition (16), often resulting in good chances. This, coupled with their lack of front-footed approach without the ball, has often allowed the opposition to pick their options. Opponents have recorded an 82% pass completion rate against Italy, the third-highest such figure in the tournament.Le Azzurre have often invited teams to press them in their own third, looking to bait and play the ball over the top. Opponents have attempted 10 tackles in the attacking third against Italy, the most against any remaining side in the tournament. The effect can also be seen in their passing accuracy of 75%, the lowest of any of the semifinalists.Spain: Speed and set piecesplay1:23Keogh: Every team is beatable at Euro 2025Emily Keogh reacts to Spain's 2-0 win over Switzerland to secure a semifinal spot at Euro 2025.Spain have looked a formidable side so far. They have scored the most goals in the tournament (16) and have conceded the fewest of any remaining side (3).The world champions have controlled the ball and the territory in all their games, and 37% of their open-play touches have come in the attacking third, the highest share for any side. Their midfield is blessed with multiple Ballon d'Or winners, who offer defensive and offensive stability.Beside this, coach Montse Tome has a plethora of goal-scoring options. Four players have registered multiple goals in the competition for Spain (the most), with Esther González leading the pack with four.Spain maintains a near monopoly on the ball, averaging a tournament high of 73.5% possession, making it difficult for opponents to generate opportunities against them. The opposition has registered just 35 touches inside Spain's penalty box, the fewest any side has allowed in this tournament.Despite the seemingly herculean task, there are areas to exploit against La Roja. With the full backs pushed up in their possession play, having two quick players to pin the center backs and run the channels is one such play.This was used by Italy, resulting in a couple of opportunities thanks to runs from Sofia Cantore and was the primary idea behind coach Pia Sundhage opting for a front two of Sydney Schertenleib and Iman Beney. With the center back pairing often lacking recovery speed, these opportunities appear during the game.Another aspect where teams can look to hurt Spain is from set pieces. Belgium found success targeting the tallest player in the box, and Italy also caused some problems with it. Though the Spaniards don't lack in physicality, their aerial win rate is the lowest of any remaining side in the tournament (45%) (with a caveat of having contested the fewest duels).Germany: The lack of controlplay1:32Laurens thinks it's a 'tough ask' for Germany to beat SpainJulien Laurens explains what Germany need to do to challenge Spain in their Euro 2025 semifinal.Germany produced a valiant effort, defending with 10 players against a dynamic French attack for more than 100 minutes. They became the first side in Women's Euros history to stage a comeback with fewer players.The eight-time champions have not hit their pre-tournament stride yet. Often, they rely on their incredible wide players with two-way influence, Klara Bühl and Jule Brand. The two have been at the forefront of driving the possession forward, taking on players and creating opportunities. No side has recorded more carries into the penalty area than Germany (40).Bühl and Brand rank in the top five for progressive carries (38 and 16, respectively) and completed take-ons (17 and 11 respectively). No player has won more tackles than OL Lyonnes' Brand for Germany (10), with eight of her 14 attempts coming in the defensive third.The problems for Germany exist in the midfield and a makeshift defense. Between a suspension for veteran center back Kathrin Hendrich, injury to captain and only right back Giulia Gwinn and fitness concerns over Sarai Linder, Christian Wück's side is paper thin at the back.These problems are only amplified by Sjoeke Nüsken's suspension due to accumulation of yellow cards. The Chelsea midfielder is the joint top goal scorer for the Germans, having scored in back-to-back games. She ranks in the top three for multiple offensive and defensive metrics for Germany, including shots, touches in the penalty box and recoveries.The German midfield, by design, has lacked control in this tournament. It has struggled to retain and circulate possession and has been overrun quite easily. These issues were exposed against Sweden, who put four past Wück's side by overloading the wide areas, and they will persist given the lack of options to fix them.Manufacturing numerical advantages in wide areas is a simple tactic to hurt an often-retreating German defense. With the wide players shouldering a massive two-way load, it's easy to catch them out of shape.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Media caption, Scheffler 'masterclass' seals Open titleGolf correspondentIf Rory McIlroy is still seeking his \"next Everest\", he need look no further than new Open champion Scottie Scheffler.Even in a season when the Northern Irishman completed the career Grand Slam by winning the Masters, after claiming a second Players title and landing the Pebble Beach signature title, he trails the player now clutching the Claret Jug by a substantial margin.McIlroy is the world's second best player and, in that regard, the rankings do not lie.  Following Scheffler's dominant victory at Royal Portrush, his points average in the standings has risen to 20.52.McIlroy, who shared seventh place at the Open, is 8.96 points behind. That is the difference between second in the standings and Max Greyserman, who is currently 36th.Toppling Scheffler from his perch is a mountainous challenge and it has become the next objective for McIlroy.The 36-year-old from Holywood, County Down, struggled for motivation in the immediate aftermath of his epic Augusta adventure. Winning the Masters and completing the career grand slam had become his be all and end all.With the Green Jacket on his back, it took the prospect of an Open in his native Northern Ireland to bring back a sense of focus.And, as he said, his Portrush experience gave him pretty much all he wanted, bar the Claret Jug.\"That's just because one person was just a little bit better than the rest of us,\" he stated.Media caption, 'The people's champion' - McIlroy receives rapturous reception on the 18thIn truth, no-one other than Scheffler was ever going to get a sniff of holding golf's most historic trophy after the eventual champion carded his second-round 64.As the world rankings reflect, the tall American is head and shoulders above the rest at delivering when the biggest titles are on the line. This was his second major of the year, following his convincing triumph in May's US PGA at Quail Hollow.While the post-championship chat is littered with understandable comparisons between Scheffler's current success and the way the great Tiger Woods dominated the game, McIlroy remains the most likely to challenge the world number one's supremacy.Between June 2011 and August 2014 McIlroy was similarly dominant, winning the US Open, US PGA and The Open.Like Scheffler, it was a quick surge to four majors, the first two won with eight shots to spare.There then came an 11-year barren spell for McIlroy that no-one back then could have anticipated. But he remained in the very upper echelons of the game throughout that period of frustrating near misses.He has now played in 67 majors and finished in the top 10 33 times.It is an extraordinarily long run of remarkable consistency that no other active player can match.Officially an all-time great, as one of only six winners of all four majors, McIlroy could be satisfied with his lot.How much more is there in the tank to keep pushing to be the best in the world?Media caption, The best shots from The Open Championship at Royal PortrushMcIlroy has been doing it for a very long time, but there seems little diminishing of appetite.He is determined to contribute to another away win in the Ryder Cup in September and would love an Olympic medal in 2028.There is also the challenge of trying to emerge from Scheffler's long shadow.\"All you can do is admire what he does and how he does it,\" McIlroy said.\"What he does is one thing, but how he does it is another. He just goes about his business, doesn't do anything overly flamboyant, but he's the best at executing in the game right now.\"It's been absolutely amazing over these past two to three years. All you can do is tip your cap and watch in admiration.\"Another Open has passed without an English winner, none since Nick Faldo in 1992. But Matt Fitzpatrick's return to form was an encouraging reminder of the 2022 US Open champion's world-class pedigree.In a share of fourth, Fitzpatrick beat Bob MacIntyre by a shot. The Scot tied for seventh, again demonstrating his major credentials following a runner-up finish at June's US Open.Tyrrell Hatton faded on the final day to finish alongside Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose and John Parry at seven under and inside the top 20. They also know the man they have to beat if they are to enjoy future major success.Right now McIlroy is the player most likely to challenge Scheffler.\"All I can do is focus on myself and try to play the best golf that I can,\" he said.\"I know that, when I do that, I'll have my weeks where I'll contend and hopefully win.\"More on this story</p>"

As he went up, I saw the handball. Maradona did it well. It was cute, you would say that.\"I remember the ground exploding [with fans celebrating] and I realised he'd given it. Glenn Hoddle, Terry Fenwick, Shilts and me ran after the referee.\"Reid describes seeing Maradona's second goal unfold as he forlornly gave chase as like \"being in a dream\".\"He was just too quick. If you look again, Hoddle gets fouled, it wasn't given and then Maradona's gone.\"His touch and pace [was staggering] even with the pitch being awful and covered with potholes. He was just too quick.\"\"From the stand at the far end of the stadium where I was sat as a substitute, I just clapped,\" Anderson interjects.\"Well, I was on the pitch so couldn't have got away with that,\" Reid responds with a laugh.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Maradona's shirt from the game was auctioned by Sotheby's in May 2022Other items due to be auctioned as part of the same event include Pele's World Cup winner's medal from 1958, which is valued at up to £500,000.Gordon Banks' 1966 winner's medal is estimated to fetch about £300,000 while Alan Ball's shirt from the game is expected to sell for in the region of £200,000.Also going under the hammer will be goalscorer Martin Peters' spare shirt from the final which auctioneers suggest is worth in the region of £50,000.More on this topic</p>"

      "content": "<p>Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Steve Tandy joined Scotland as defence coach in 2019Updated 50 minutes agoSteve Tandy has been named Wales men's head coach.The Scotland defence coach finished his commitments with Gregor Townsend's team during their summer tour and will link up with his native Wales on 1 September.The 45-year-old former Neath and Ospreys flanker was under contract with Scotland but the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has agreed a deal to release him.The exact length of Tandy's Wales contract has not been disclosed but the WRU says he will be in charge until at least the 2027 World Cup in Australia, with the indication being the governing body seeing his appointment as a long-term move.\"Becoming head coach of my home country is a massive honour and a privilege,\" said Tandy.The WRU has been looking for a permanent successor to Warren Gatland, who resigned during the Six Nations in February.Cardiff's Matt Sherratt took over on a temporary basis for the rest of the tournament and then agreed to remain in place for the summer tour of Japan.Tandy's first game in charge will be against Argentina in Cardiff on Sunday, 9 November, before further autumn internationals against Japan, New Zealand and South Africa.He is the first homegrown permanent head coach of the men's Test side since Gareth Jenkins was sacked in September 2007, although fellow Welshmen Nigel Davies, Robin McBryde and Rob Howley have taken interim charge since then.Rebuilding Welsh rugbyTandy will have his work cut out as he takes on a national side in crisis and with Welsh rugby in disarray.Wales briefly slipped to a record low of 14th in the world rankings in July, before returning to 12th where they currently stand.They had suffered a record run of 18 straight Test defeats, a 21-month losing sequence which was finally halted with victory against Japan in Kobe earlier this month.\"I am looking forward to playing a role in the rebuilding phase of Welsh rugby and taking the national team back to competing with the best countries in the world,\" said Tandy.\"I am excited about the potential of Welsh rugby and the group of young, hard-working players we have.\"The autumn fixtures represent a huge opportunity and give us a chance to test ourselves against some of the best teams in world rugby.\"Media caption, Japan win 'must be the start of something' for Wales'Best man for the job'Born in Tonmawr, Tandy played for local side Neath RFC and then Ospreys but was not capped by Wales.  The former back row will return to Wales after coaching Ospreys between 2012 and 2018. He won the Celtic League title in his first season in charge of the Swansea-based region.Tandy left Ospreys for a role with Australian side Waratahs, before linking up with Scotland in 2019.He also held a defence coach role with Gatland's British and Irish Lions squad in South Africa in 2021.WRU chief executive Abi Tierney says Tandy was the \"standout candidate\" and that the Union had secured the \"very best coach\" for the job.\"This is a keystone appointment for us and an integral part of our five-year strategy as we look to achieve sustainable success for our senior men's side,\" said Tierney.\"Steve fits the bill in terms of the affinity he will be able to create with a young group of players with huge potential, but also the galvanising effect we know he can have on the whole rugby ecosystem as a proud Welshman.\"Our task now is to ensure Steve has the support and resources he needs to succeed in this role.\"Backroom staff decisionsThe decision to go for Tandy was overseen by new WRU director of rugby Dave Reddin.\"Steve's coaching journey and the approach he has taken to his own learning and development since leaving the Ospreys impressed us during the interview process,\" said Reddin.\"He embodies the collaborative and systematic approach to building success that I want to instil across our high-performance system.\"Steve is an excellent coach with the motivation and curiosity to continue to learn and develop very much a part of his DNA. These are hugely important characteristics for everyone in our system.\"There has been no official news of who will make up Tandy's backroom staff, but Wales will look to recruit some coaches who have been involved in the past two campaigns.Cardiff head coach Sherratt is in line to be attack coach, while current Harlequins scrum coach Adam Jones and Gloucester assistant Rhys Thomas are also being considered for roles under Tandy.\"Steve is a vital part of the future strategy for success in Welsh rugby and I will ensure he has the space, time and support to realise the potential of the exciting group of players he will have at his disposal,\" said Reddin.\"He brings a wealth of experience, a unique understanding of Wales and the young talent we have at our disposal and a huge amount of passion and desire to excel in the role.\"Mixed emotions for ScotlandScottish Rugby chief executive Alex Williams says he was \"disappointed\" to see Tandy leave.\"We have worked closely with Abi Tierney and her team at the Welsh Rugby Union to allow Steve to join them and recruitment for a suitable replacement is under way,\" said Williams.\"Steve is an extremely popular and talented coach and so we have mixed emotions. \"At Scottish Rugby we aim to have the best coaches in the world and Steve is one of them.\"Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend says Tandy had a \"positive influence\" on Scottish Rugby. \"He has helped me massively in my role and been someone I've leaned on for advice,\" said Townsend.\"We've worked together on various ways of improving the environment and team over the years.\"It'll be sad not having him with us anymore but it's also a massive honour for him to become the head coach of his home country.\"</p>"

But much of the attention was focused on what happened before the game when players warmed up with shirts bearing the message “Pay us what you owe us.”The move came after players and the league failed to reach a deal on a new collective bargaining agreement. Do they have a point though? Evaluating athlete pay is notoriously tricky because sports accounting always includes a certain amount of voodoo.That’s especially true in the WNBA, whose fortunes – literally and figuratively – are tied up with the NBA’s, for better or for worse. The relationship has evolved through the years, and many current WNBA teams have no direct ties with an NBA team, although some remain under NBA ownership. NBA commissioner Adam Silver refers to the two leagues as “integrated,” and they have bundled their broadcast rights together in a massive 11-year deal.And Silver is the one who has faced pressure within the NBA over the WNBA’s apparent losses, something that those who believe the likes of Collier and Caitlin Clark should be happy with their current salaries often use as a counter argument to demands for a pay hike. Silver said in 2018 that the WNBA’s losses were roughly $10m a year. And reports last fall said the WNBA was due to lose $40m in 2024. Adjust the 2018 figures for inflation, and the WNBA is supposedly losing three times as much as it was a few years ago.That’s a curious figure given other public statistics suggest the league’s financial health has never been better.First, while WNBA attendance dropped from an overall average of more than 10,000 in the late 1990s to a little under 7,000 just after the pandemic, Clark and Co wiped out most of those losses in 2024 alone, pushing the league average close to 10,000 again, and the league is flirting with a new record in 2025. Second, the league’s broadcast rights alone have ballooned from zero in 2002 to roughly $60m a year in the current deal, with that number set to go to $200m as part of the combined deal with the NBA. Third, total league revenue jumped from $102m in 2019 to the $180m-$200m range in 2023, Bloomberg reported.Some expenses have gone up, most notably a $25m per year commitment to fly teams by charter planes rather than on regular flights, as has been the case in the past. The WNBA salary cap has also risen incrementally from $622,000 in 2003 (inflation-adjusted to 2025: $1.1m) to $1.5m in 2025. The league has one fewer team now (13 instead of 14) than it did in 2003 (although expansion teams are on their way) so the total cost of player pay has gone from a maximum of $15.4m to $19.5m. But these expenses don’t add up to a full counterweight to the reported rise in revenue or the well-publicized jump in broadcast rights. It’s a good bet that Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, the owners of the WNBA’s well-supported Golden State Valkyries and the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, are taking a bigger risk by paying 37-year-old Stephen Curry nearly $60m a year than they are in paying the entire Valkyries roster barely $1m.The bottom line is that we don’t know what’s included in the bottom line. Reinvestment in the league? Facilities? Postgame meals catered by five-star restaurants? (Surely not the latter.)All we know is that it’s not going to the players. Generally, the less a league makes, the lower the share of revenue its players get – 50% of $1bn is less of a chore to pay than 25% of $100m. But WNBA players are making less than 10%, a rather tiny figure for any professional organization.And in the land of voodoo accounting, sports teams have been adept at pleading penury when circumstances call for it. It’s not just the WNBA either. Eight years ago, ESPN uncovered numbers showing nearly half of the NBA’s teams didn’t generate a profit on their own.Perhaps the best indicator of how well WNBA teams are actually doing – or are poised to do – is the price paid when teams are sold. The New York Liberty were sold in 2019 for somewhere in the $10m-$14m range. Six years later, based on a sale of a stake of the team, the the Liberty’s value was calculated at around $450m.Little wonder WNBA players are noticing these figures and asking why their pay is still small enough that many of them are forced to spend their offseasons playing elsewhere. Players’ “Pay Us What You Owe Us” T-shirts at the All-Star Game weren’t printed on a sudden whim. None of those players are suggesting that they should be paid the same as their counterparts in the NBA, where league revenues top $10bn a year. But they surely deserve more, considering the WNBA rookie minimum is just $66,000 compared to $1.27m in the NBA.And it’s not just the per-player pay. It’s the number of players who get paid at all.A typical NBA roster now has 15 full-time players and three “two-way” players who are called up from the second-tier G-League. WNBA teams are limited to 12 players, and some may only carry 11. In a recent Golden State-Phoenix game, Phoenix only had eight players available.So job security is minimal, and those low paychecks sting a bit more when a player is a few bad games away from not receiving them at all.WNBA players may face a bit of opposition as they strive for improved salaries. Some NBA owners seem less enthusiastic than others about the whole venture, even if the most pessimistic reports of WNBA losses don’t even add up to the salary of a Curry or a Jayson Tatum alone. Some corners of social media have reacted to the WNBA All-Stars T-shirts with the expected chortling and guffawing. But the post-Covid women’s sports boom shows no sign of abating, and the numbers as we know them seem to be on the players’ side. Public opinion is likely to follow.</p>"

The move will be Rashford's second consecutive loan spell after a six-month stint with Aston Villa in the second half of last season.The forward is expected to complete a medical with the La Liga club early this week, with the aim of being able to join Barcelona's pre-season tour of Japan and South Korea on Thursday. Should Rashford join the tour, he could come up against former United team-mate Jesse Lingard.Lingard, 32, is in his second season with K League side FC Seoul, who face Barcelona on 31 July. Another of Rashford's former team-mates, Monaco midfielder Paul Pogba, told YouTuber IShowSpeed: \"I'm happy for him because they (United) took his number.\"Manchester United are losing a great player. Unlucky for them. It's great for Barcelona.'It's not really his (Amorim's) fault. If he doesn't believe in someone... He needs to win. If he doesn't win they're going to sack him.\"Image source, Mundo Deportivo/SPORTImage caption, Mundo Deportivo and SPORT, two of Spain's leading sports publications, led with images of Rashford arriving in Barcelona on Sunday. SPORT's headline says 'Rashford is already here'. More on this story</p>"

      "content": "<p>Brown-Finnis' Euros semi-finals predictionsFour teams are within touching distance of winning Euro 2025, including holders England, but who will make it to the final at St Jakob-Park in Basel on 27 July?The Lionesses take on Italy on Tuesday, while the other semi-final sees world champions Spain face Germany on Wednesday.BBC Sport football expert Rachel Brown-Finnis is predicting the outcome of all 31 games in Switzerland.She picked all four winners of the quarter-finals, meaning she has been right about 20 of the 28 (71%) matches so far.You were wrong about two of the last-eight ties, Italy's victory over Norway and Germany getting the better of France. Only 26% of you saw that last one coming, meaning your overall total is 18/28 (64%).There are only three games to go, so can you catch Rachel in the semi-finals? You can make your own predictions below.Before the tournament, Brown-Finnis chose seven of the eight teams that made it through to the knockout stage, including England, who she believes will win the tournament.Semi-final ties22 July, 20:00 BSTStade de Geneve, GenevaWorld ranking: 5th v 13thBest previous Euros finish: England - winners 2022; Italy - runner-up 1993 & 1997Live commentary on Radio 5 Live and BBC SoundsThe quarter-finals served up an absolute whirlwind of drama and I am expecting both semi-finals to be just as exciting.Whoever gets through each tie, it will not just come down to who is the best team - so many other factors will help decide the winner and all four of the remaining sides have already shown their different qualities and characteristics.One of England's is resilience and another is courage. I said during my commentary that when Lucy Bronze stuck away the winning penalty against Sweden, it was like Stuart Pearce's spot-kick in the shoot-out against Spain at Euro 96.All of Lucy's emotions and her pride to do that for her country came out. It's what tournament football is all about and it is a moment that will stick with everyone who watched it, myself included.Media caption, England win on penalties after fightback against Sweden to advance to Euro semisI'd love to say this game will be much more straightforward for England and that they will sail through but I think we've already learned that it won't be that easy.If you had offered England a semi-final against Italy before these Euros started, they would have taken it. Also, if I was predicting a game between the two teams back then, I would have been very confident and said I could only see a Lionesses win.Now, however, it is a very different scenario. We have seen Italy grow as this tournament has gone on, including their self-belief. They will think they can beat England and they are going to be very dangerous opponents.Fatigue could be one factor - the Azzure have had one day's more rest than England, who also had to get through extra-time and penalties - but the way Italy play is going to cause England problems too.Media caption, Italy through to semi-finals with late winnerThey deserved to beat Norway in the quarter-finals and their one defeat so far came against Spain in their final group game, after they went toe to toe with them at first.They took their foot off the gas against the world champions in the second half but I think that was only because of the circumstances in the Portugal-Belgium game and Italy knowing they were still going through as long as they did not lose too heavily.I don't expect them to hold back at all here. They will probably come absolutely flying out of the blocks after seeing how Sweden's fast start opened up Sarina Wiegman's side. I do think England will be better defensively than they were against Sweden, but they will have to be.Wiegman will have a different gameplan for this tie anyhow, in terms of how she sets her side up, but what she really needs is a performance for 90 minutes at the level we know England can produce rather than them just getting going in the second half, the way they did against Sweden.So, how they start this game is hugely important. England have to play no-risk football in the opening few minutes so they can feel their way into the game and get through the first 10 or 15 minutes unscathed.They can't leave the door open the way they did early on against Sweden or give Italy's attack any encouragement whatsoever. By that, I mean they must avoid playing themselves into trouble if they are under pressure when they play out from the back.This is Italy's first semi-final at a major finals since 1997 but they will feel they belong on this stage as much as England do and they certainly won't care that they are facing the holders. Going ahead would only boost their confidence further and I want to see England start on the front foot this time.Ultimately, Italy would probably be happy if this goes into extra-time, knowing England have more minutes in their legs, but I don't think this tie will get that far. It is going to be a very tough 90 minutes for all Lionesses fans as well as the players on the pitch but I am backing England to get the job done in normal time.Brown-Finnis' prediction: 2-1 23 July, 20:00 BSTStadion Letzigrund, ZurichWorld ranking: 3rd v 2ndBest previous Euros finish: Germany - Eight-time winners between 1989 & 2013; Spain - semi-finals 1997Watch live on BBC One, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website; live commentary on Radio 5 Live and BBC SoundsI had a feeling Germany would get the better of France somehow, and I was right, but what an amazing battle that quarter-final was.As a goalkeeper, I particularly enjoyed Ann-Katrin Berger's performance to help Germany get through. Her save to keep out team-mate Janina Minge's backward header was absolutely outstanding.All the aspects of it are so hard to execute - Berger was at full stretch, moving backwards and trying to push off. She was able to use her athleticism and long frame but also drew on her determination to just about keep the ball out of the net.It added to what had already been an exciting game, with Germany down to 10 players for so long before eventually getting through on penalties, with Berger again the hero.Media caption, Germany's Berger with 'the save of the tournament'Overall, it was the kind of team performance that epitomised Germany's progress in Switzerland, where they have packed a lot into their four games so far - good and bad. Very little has gone exactly to plan but against France they still found a way of winning.The way they responded after Kathrin Hendrich was sent off, you would not have known France had an extra player. That's credit to their manager Christian Wuck for instantly reorganising his team and also the resolve of their players.Just like England, Germany have shown they know how to get through games and they definitely know it is not always about winning pretty.All of this is why they are a team to be reckoned with and why they will be such tough opponents for Spain.Media caption, How two moments of brilliance helped Spain beat SwitzerlandSpain are the world champions and the only team to have won all their games to get this far. They have also scored 16 goals in four matches and dominated possession each time but I still think they look vulnerable on the transition.Switzerland used their pace to get behind Spain's high line early in their quarter-final and Germany will feel they can get at them too.It will be interesting to see who starts up top for Germany and whether it is Giovanna Hoffman who leads their line again or if they come up with a different plan. They definitely won't have more of the ball than Spain but they are pretty clinical when they do get a sight of goal so they know they can still hurt them.Germany's intensity and resolve will help them here too and I would not be surprised if Berger produces another similar performance to keep them in this game - one way or another they are going to push Spain all the way.I am co-commentating on this game and I am already thinking it could go to penalties but when it comes to making a prediction, then I have to back Spain to do something special again to win the game beforehand. We know they are capable of it.Brown-Finnis' prediction: 2-3 after extra timeMore on this story</p>"

Other events of this size are played out in cities of similar stature, but the sight of superstar Scottie Scheffler hoisting the Claret Jug on the 18th green of a brilliant, yet remote, course tucked away on the north coast of the island of Ireland summed up what is unique about this championship.There have been plenty of similarly seemingly incongruous scenes over the past seven days.Whether it be multi-millionaires getting their morning coffee in establishments where an Ulster fry would set you back less than £7, a former Open winner becoming a repeat customer at a small pie shop on the main street or the defending champion sinking a stout round the corner, The Open did not just come to town, it became a part of it for the duration of its stay.Australian Cameron Smith, who won his Claret Jug at St Andrews in 2022, could hardly have paid Portrush a bigger compliment than comparing it to the home of golf.\"It seems like there's a lot of Opens where the course is great but the town doesn't really get involved, whereas this one kind of seems like everyone in town is happy to have you here and gets around the whole tournament,\" he said.\"It's right up there. It's a very similar feeling to St Andrews for sure.\"In a week that began with the eventual winner questioning the meaning of it all, there was great purpose in the way the first arriving fans flooded through the gates and on to the course after word spread that McIlroy had snuck out for a practice round at the earliest available opportunity. Those first holes on Monday, and his stints watching chunks of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer between rounds, must have felt like the briefest slices of quiet for the most recent member of golf's Grand Slam club.At all other points around Royal Portrush, galleries thronged around the Holywood star, the roars that greeted each of his made putts reverberating across the links. While his walk off the 18th green was without the Claret Jug, the love for the returning hero - playing at home for the first time since his Masters victory - was a far more fitting conclusion to his week than the tearful missed cut back in 2019.But it was not just McIlroy who sparked adoration. Americans Bryson DeChambeau and Jordan Spieth, as well as England's Tommy Fleetwood, were among other huge draws obliging as many requests for selfies and autographs as time allowed. The thump of children's feet along grandstands as players neared with golf balls sounded like the promised thunder. So keen were others to take home a souvenir of their week by more conventional means, queues for the merchandise tent snaked round multiple sets of barriers with one visitor reportedly spending £13,000 in one transaction.Others were content with more transitory pleasures. On Padraig Harrington's insistence that Royal Portrush had the best ice creams on The Open rota, there seemed general agreement after what was surely a record number of 99s consumed up and down the links. A more uniquely Northern Irish staple - the 'fifteen' traybake - proved more divisive in the media centre.The coconut-based treat was not all that failed to gain universal popularity. Jason Day was left confounded by local weather forecasts as the week proved true the old cliche about Northern Ireland featuring all four seasons in one day, while marathon rounds on Thursday left a few players grumbling about bottlenecks on the course. Those that took the time to look around as they waited, though, were rewarded with the spectacular views that make Portrush such a memorable course for the hacker and world's best player alike.\"It's one of the coolest views that I've seen in the game of golf, to be honest with you,\" said Scheffler of the course's signature hole Calamity Corner.\"It was a day in which you had a bunch of rain and there was rainbows on the other side, and you're looking out over the golf course on the right, and you've got the huge bluffs by the ocean and it's just mounds and hills, and the town is in the distance.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Rory McIlroy played to packed galleries every day after missing the cut in 2019Even Shane Lowry, who had the best golf day of his life here six years ago when winning the 148th Open Championship, cut a wholly frustrated figure at points during a weekend when he was handed a two-shot penalty on Friday and struggled with illness in his third round.Still, after a brilliant closing 66 on Sunday, Royal Portrush had clearly redeemed itself in the Offaly man's eyes when all was said and done.Asked by BBC Sport NI when would he like to see The Open be back here for its fourth staging, he replied: \"How about next year?\"While it will surely be longer than a six-year wait for another go, after another hugely successful week, a return sooner rather than later seems a certainty.</p>"

Their quarter-final victory against Switzerland was more difficult than expected and required significant patience. They were not at their best – the hosts did not allow them to be – but the calibre of the world champions’ squad means the opposition cannot switch off, even for an instant. Finding a way is relatively easy when you have Aitana Bonmatí on the field, and her back-heeled assist for Athenea del Castillo’s opener on Friday night was the moment of inspiration they needed. Winning in front of a partisan host crowd is also an achievement mentally.2) EnglandSarina Wiegman described England’s win against Sweden as one of the hardest matches she has ever watched. But it was also one of the most thrilling. The holders were outplayed in the first half but came back through sheer grit, tactical adaptability and a bench-worth of game-changers. The Lionesses became the first team in Euros history to turn around a 2-0 deficit in a knockout match and they have been in the semi-finals of every major tournament since 2015. That shows a mental resilience not many teams possess. To then win the penalty shootout in the manner they did – through the pure willpower of Lucy Bronze if nothing else – illustrated how important this is.3) ItalyThe development of this Italy side since crashing out of the 2023 World Cup at the group stage has been nothing short of remarkable. Andrea Soncin has brought fresh life to a team that were threatening to go backwards. They dominated their quarter-final victory over Norway, utilising Arianna Caruso’s passing range, Sofia Cantore’s speed in wide areas and Cristiana Girelli’s instinctive eye for goal, and celebrated reaching their first major tournament semi-final since 1997 with fervour, tears falling and Natasha Bedingfield’s Unwritten echoing through the hallways of the Stade de Genève.4) GermanyThe difference in Germany between their group defeat by Sweden and the performance they put in to overcome France could not have been starker. They were reduced to 10 players in both matches, but they left everything on the pitch in their quarter-final encounter on Saturday night, battling against the odds to reach the last four once again. There is no doubt that Christian Wück’s side are wounded. Their backline is decimated by injury and suspension. There is strength to be found in resilience, however, and Germany displayed plenty of that in Basel.Michelle Agyemang scored England’s equaliser in the dramatic quarter-final win against Sweden. Photograph: Philipp Kresnik/SheKicks/SPP/Shutterstock5) SwitzerlandEveryone present inside the Stadion Wankdorf on Friday understood they were witnessing something special. Switzerland have captured the heart of their nation over the past month and their performance against Spain, despite ultimate defeat, will have only brought in more fans. About 25,000 marched through the city of Berne to the match, a sea of red and white that illustrated this goes way beyond the plucky, tenacious performances of Pia Sundhage’s young group. They have forged a bond with their fans; it is now up to those in power to ensure this opportunity is not missed.6) FranceA week ago, France very much looked like a team who could win this tournament, one who had shaken off numerous past issues. But once again, their knockout curse raised its head. Their shootout defeat by Germany was their eighth in their past nine appearances at a quarter-final stage, and it is the way this one happened that will hurt the most. Despite an injury-struck Germany being reduced to 10 players early on, Laurent Bonadei’s side created nine chances and recorded an xG of only 0.63 from open play. The inquest will begin shortly.Ann-Katrin Berger saved Amel Majri’s penalty in the shootout as Germany sealed an unlikely victory against France. Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images7) SwedenPeter Gerhardsson’s dejected appearance after defeat by England summed it all up. The Sweden manager could not comprehend how his in-form side had not won. The initial gameplan was “perfect” but their inability to retain their energy levels and adapt to the Lionesses’ tactical adaptations proved their downfall. Add in some strange substitutions and penalty-taker decisions and it was Sweden who found themselves on the plane home. This was their first defeat since July 2024 and they had taken the tournament by storm up to this point, cruising through the group stage. Ultimately there was a sad end to Gerhardsson’s eight-year tenure.8) NorwayHow to solve a problem like Norway. That is the question that remains after yet another knockout stage defeat. On paper they possess one of the strongest attacks in Europe, but they all too often fail to be a sum of their parts. Their performance against Italy was disappointing, offering very little bar a 10-minute spell in the second half. Gemma Grainger’s side registered just one shot on target in 90 minutes; Ada Hegerberg’s equaliser. Their failing repeatedly on the global stage requires a comprehensive rethink by the Norwegian FA if they are ever going to realise their potential.</p>"

His ceiling is fancied to be higher than his towering release point, even if he is a No 11 with the bat and a competent fielder at best.Dawson sits at the other end of more than one spectrum: a 5ft 8in left-arm spinner who, aged 35, has banked 206 first-class games for Hampshire. This recall, eight years after the last of his three Test caps, also offers England greater flexibility when it comes to picking their seam attack. Dawson, who is a livewire in the field, can slot in at No 8 comfortably given he has 18 first-class hundreds. However, for Jeetan Patel, the assistant coach who oversees England’s spinners, this switch is a pragmatic pick that rewards a seasoned pro in Dawson. As for where it leads when everyone is fit and available, not least next winter’s Ashes tour, the mantra under Brendon McCullum, the head coach, is that things will work themselves out.“Speaking to Daws, he is fizzing,” Patel says. “I know what it is like when you think the opportunity has gone. To still be wanted and loved, and to come into a major series 2-1 up with a chance to win it, there really is no better feeling. He showed all his skills in the white-ball series against West Indies earlier in the summer – bowling wide, tight, pace on, pace off – and I think he will grow again. He’s not a one-dimensional left-armer who just lands it on a length and it is pretty clear how we play: we’re not too worried about runs, we want players who win moments.Liam Dawson celebrates Jos Buttler’s stumping of the West Indies batter Johnson Charles at Chester-le-Street in June. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images“So we should be able to plug-and-play with Daws. He has all the tools and there has also been more rough for the left-arm spinners to work with this series. Who knows what comes from it but I think it is an excellent selection and an opportunity for him.”With Dawson’s bowling maturing in the past two and a half seasons, returning 124 championship wickets, he will need much less guidance than Bashir and brings a thicker tactical playbook to the table. However, this is not a sign that England’s belief in the Bashir project is wavering, with the youngster having already claimed 68 wickets from his first 19 Test outings and Patel heavily involved in his development.If anything, Bashir left Lord’s last Monday with his reputation only enhanced. Having sustained a broken finger on his left hand on the third day of the second Test – Ravindra Jadeja smashing the ball back for a tough return chance – Bashir still emerged with the bat, bravely helping to add seven useful runs for the 10th wicket in what became a tight game. Then came that chef’s kiss of a final wicket, Mohammed Siraj bowled playing on to complete a tense 22-run victory.“Absolutely not,” Patel says, when asked if Bashir’s injury spared them a tough selection issue. “I think he has bowled excellently this summer and without much assistance, against some of the best players of spin in the world. It hasn’t ragged and there has been no bounce. But he has held his own and struck at key moments, like nicking off KL Rahul just after his century and when he looked so set.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionShoaib Bashir dismisses Mohammed Siraj to win the third Test at Lord’s despite having a broken finger on his left hand. Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images“Bash is a tough cookie. That moment at the end gave everyone a warm fuzzy feeling because it just showed his commitment to the group. Other guys might have stayed in the dressing room but he was just desperate to contribute. Even when he first came off he was just angry at missing the chance and, despite being in serious pain, his only thought was getting back out there. It is such a shame but he will be back.”Getting back out there now involves a minimum wait of six weeks, with Bashir having had a wire splint inserted this week to help correct multiple fractures. The good news, however, is that he will be able to resume bowling sooner and should be up to speed to play in the County Championship in September – if Somerset select him. Jack Leach and the more all-round Archie Vaughan are preferred at Taunton these days, with Bashir set to leave when his contract expires in October. His England central contract – almost certain to be renewed – makes him an attractive signing, however, with Warwickshire and Surrey among those thought to be interested.For now, though, it is Dawson who walks out into the Test spotlight in Manchester: a late second crack at the format he doubtless thought had passed him by and one that, if it goes well, could give India and England plenty to think about.</p>"

      "category": "general",
      "content": "<p>What made playing with Bumrah unique - Pujara columnI first faced Jasprit Bumrah in a club match when he was still a teenager, long before he became my India team-mate.There were other bowlers playing in the game who had played first-class cricket but he was just different.These days, as we have seen through the current Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, he is a complete bowler, but back then the main thing about him was his pace. He was rapid.Throughout the following years he began to make his name in the Indian Premier League but before he played his first Test in Cape Town in South Africa in 2018, there were still a lot of question marks around him in India.His action was unique, people questioned whether he would be able to swing the red ball or if he had the consistency and control for the longer format.He may have only taken four wickets in that first Test but he answered all of those questions.I remember standing at first slip with Virat Kohli next to me at second and Shikhar Dhawan at third. We were all saying how it just felt unlike any of the other bowlers.We had Mohammed Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya playing in that game but again he felt different. Shami was quick but Bumrah was quicker.I stood at first slip a lot to Bumrah in my career. It was totally unique.Much is made about the angle created by his action and his position wide on the crease being difficult for batters but it is tricky for slip fielders too.The angles he creates means the wicketkeeper has to stand almost behind the stumps against right-handers, rather than on a fourth stump line. That meant I had to move further over to close the gap.It always felt like you are seeing him jog in from straight on. When you add in his skiddy trajectory everything just felt quicker.Bumrah would never shout at a slip fielder for dropping a catch – he is too nice a guy for that – but we did joke with him.Off the field Jasprit is an introvert. He spends a lot of time in his room. It is not in a bad way. He just enjoys his own company.There was a group of us – myself, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant and former wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha – who would always be playing Fifa on the PlayStation while on tour and whenever we invited Jasprit it was hard work getting him there.In the end we had to joke that we wouldn't take any catches off his bowling if he didn't come.Bumrah needed the help of a good partner when playing Fifa - as a gamer he's not up to much - but it was on his first tour of England in 2018 when he went up another level as a bowler.By the time we went to Australia the following winter we realised he was our wildcard that would play for India a very long time. He was instrumental as we won in Australia for the first time.You may remember on that tour of England a hooping inswinger he bowled to Keaton Jennings who was out lbw without playing a shot. England's batters just could not read his swing and, using the Dukes ball for the first time, when he got it to move, it moved a long way.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Bumrah has taken 217 wickets in just 47 TestsIf I had bowled a ball like that one to Jennings I would have been running around celebrating and talking about it for ages. Jasprit stayed cool and didn't ever brag.He just gets on with the next delivery.In the dressing room he is always watching the game. Most fast bowlers come off the field and relax with their feet up. He does relax but he always has an eye on the field.When I used to sit next to him he would always be giving an input on what our batters or the opposition could be doing differently, which is why he was viewed as a candidate to be captain before India appointed Shubman Gill.Most people talk about Bumrah's skills with the ball, his angle or his action but his biggest strength is often overlooked.He has a brilliant cricket brain which comes from his time in the IPL. There he worked with people like former Sri Lanka bowler Lasith Malinga and has gained the skills to outsmart a batter.His first instinct is always to bowl his best ball but if a batter gets in he knows all of their strengths and weaknesses. He has taken the skills from white-ball cricket to become the complete Test bowler.One of my favourite moments on that England tour in 2018 came in Southampton when Jasprit helped me get through to a hundred in the first innings.I was on 96 when he came out at number 11 and I have to admit I did not think I would get there but he walked in and said \"I will defend. I don't know if I will survive but I will do my best\".I ended up finishing on 132 not out as we put on 46 for the last wicket.That day sums him up because whether batting or bowling he is a very competitive cricketer.When it comes to his bowling, no matter the situation of the game, he always wants and believes he can get a wicket.Ultimately, he is the perfect team man.Cheteshwar Pujara was speaking to BBC Sport's Matthew HenryMore on this story</p>"

      "content": "<p>Multiple ContributorsJul 20, 2025, 08:32 PM ETCollege football's 2026 recruiting class features a record 23 five-star prospects in the latest ESPN 300. In the wake of 15 five-star commitments since May 1, most recently with No. 1 overall running back Derrek Cooper's pledge to Texas on July 20, only one of those five-star talents -- Ole Miss, Oklahoma and Texas defensive end target Jake Kreul -- remains uncommitted at the end of a busy summer of moves atop the 2026 class.For each commitment, recruiting reporter Eli Lederman and scouts Craig Haubert and Tom Luginbill will look at how recruits landed at their school and what we can expect in college:Lamar Brown, DT2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 1Committed to: LSU TigersBackground: Brown, the versatile, 6-foot-5, 285-pound defender from Erwinville, Louisiana, opted to stay home with the Tigers on July 10 at the end of a neck-and-neck recruiting battle between LSU and SEC rival Texas A&M, which worked harder than any program to pull Brown out of the state.Brown followed wide receiver Tristen Keys (No. 10 overall) as the Tigers' second five-star pledge in 2026 after the program secured five-stars Solomon Thomas and D.J. Pickett last cycle. He's one of four top 100 defenders in LSU's incoming class alongside defensive end Trenton Henderson (No. 61), cornerback Havon Finney Jr. (No. 72 ) and defensive tackle Richard Anderson (No. 93). If Brown remains at No. 1 in the ESPN 300 and signs with the Tigers later this year, he'll arrive as the program's first top-ranked addition since Leonard Fournette in the 2014 cycle.Scout's take: Brown is the No. 1 overall recruit and a legitimate prospect on either side of the line of scrimmage.Focused on the defensive side of the ball, Brown is arguably even a better offensive lineman and that ability to contribute on either side of the ball in trenches further increases his value to the Tigers roster. Brown is a natural knee bender who can consistently play with leverage, balance and maximize power. In camp settings, he has tested well. On the field, he displays good agility and range for a big man at around 290 pounds. He also carries that weight well, and with time and further physical development, he can easily play at over 300-pounds and still move efficiently.In addition to excellent physical tools, Brown also takes coaching well and quickly applies what he has learned. Those are traits that should help him work his way into the mix quickly, which will be expected from the hometown prospect with his ranking.The Tigers might be tempted to play Brown on the offensive side of the ball, but the plan at least in the immediate future is to play on defense. He looks poised to join a unit with some emerging talent in former five-star Dominick McKinley and Ahmad Breaux, who played well above his three-star ranking as a freshman. If they can continue to develop, Brown could enter an ideal situation where he can gain some early experience rotating in with proven players. -- HaubertZion Elee, DE2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 2Committed to: Maryland TerrapinsBackground: Once ranked as the cycle's No. 1 defender, Elee committed to Maryland on Dec. 7, 2024, after logging 120 total tackles and 23 sacks across his sophomore and junior seasons. If he ultimately signs later this year, Elee will join the Terps as the highest-ranked recruit in program history.Despite his December pledge, Elee stayed in touch with other Power 4 programs in January and initially scheduled spring official visits to Auburn, Ohio State, Penn State, South Carolina and Texas A&M before canceling those trips and formally shutting down his recruitment in late February. As things stand, Elee is still locked in with the Terps with his June 20 trip to Maryland standing as the only official visit on his calendar this spring.Scout's take: Good recruiting starts at home. If Maryland holds on to Elee, he'd be the first No. 1 prospect from the area to reach Maryland in the ESPN 300 era, and the first time in five cycles the Terps landed the top in-state prospect. At roughly 6-foot-4 with an 80-inch wingspan, Elee is a lean, lengthy and disruptive edge rusher. That length blended with an excellent first step and a strong motor wreaks havoc off the edge. Maryland ranked last in sacks (14) in the Big Ten in 2024. The Terps hope signing Elee and 2025 ESPN 300 defensive end Zahir Mathis will remedy that situation. They could emerge as one of the conference's most formidable pass-rushing duos. -- HaubertJackson Cantwell, OT2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 3Committed to: Miami HurricanesBackground: Cantwell is the son of two Olympic shot putters -- including a silver medalist at the 2008 Beijing Games -- and his commitment to the Hurricanes marks perhaps the biggest recruiting win in Mario Cristobal's tenure leading Miami.A towering, yet athletic lineman, Cantwell kept in-state Missouri and Michigan involved in his process before cutting his finalists to Georgia, Miami, Ohio State and Oregon last month. Cantwell took a multi-day trip to see the Hurricanes in March and joins Miami as the program's highest-ranked pledge since Cristobal took over following the 2021 season. Cantwell, a two-time state champion shot putter who holds multiple national high school throwing records, intends to continue his track and field career alongside football in college.Scout's take: A former offensive lineman at Miami, Cristobal has landed a key building block for that unit. The Canes' O-Line unit looks to be strong this season, but could lose several pieces from that group after this season. Cristobal began reloading the unit in the Class of 2025, by signing the top interior offensive lineman in the country in S.J. Alofaituli, who projects to be in the mix this fall. Now the Canes has the No. 1 OT in the 2026 class.Cantwell is a massive presence at roughly 6-foot-7 and 320 pounds and is powerful and tenacious in his play. Beyond his size, Cantwell is a flexible big body with good feet. He could have some growing pains early in his college career in pass protection, but should be expected to come in and play right away. His arrival could time well with the potential departure of 2023 five-star OL Francis Mauigoa who is projected as a 2026 first-round NFL pick. Cantwell could have a similar trajectory as Mauigoa in that he is a plug-and-play addition that experiences some early challenges but continues to develop into a key piece of the unit and an eventual NFL prospect. -- HaubertDia Bell, QB2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 4Committed to: Texas LonghornsBackground: Bell, the son of 12-year NBA veteran Raja Bell, is the nation's top QB recruit and the longest-tenured member of the Longhorns' 2026 class. He has been locked in with Texas since he committed in June 2024 following a series of visits with the program last spring.A three-year starter at American Heritage, Bell threw for 2,597 yards and 29 touchdowns with a 70.6% completion percentage as a junior last fall before suffering a season-ending leg injury. Despite flip efforts from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and LSU earlier this year, Bell's sights remain set on signing with the Longhorns and coach Steve Sarkisian in December.Scout's take: Hopefully Bell takes a page out of Arch Manning's development blueprint when it comes to patience and focus. He's going to only get bigger, stronger and more mature without being thrown into the fire right away. Bell's fit is quite similar to what Manning brought to the Longhorns. He's a naturally gifted passer who is a better athlete and runner than Quinn Ewers and gives the Longhorns another player they can develop. Bell has continually performed at a high level against top high school competition and should be ready to make the leap to the next level. -- Tom LuginbillChris Henry Jr., WR2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 5Committed to: Ohio State BuckeyesBackground: The son of late Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry, Chris Henry Jr. has been committed since July 2023, longer than any other prospect within the 2026 ESPN 300.A knee injury sidelined Henry for the majority of his junior campaign, but he proved himself as an elite playmaker in his last complete season, when he totaled 71 catches for 1,127 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns as a sophomore at Withrow (Ohio) High School in 2023. Initially set for official visits to Ohio State, Miami, Oregon and USC this spring, Henry shut down his recruitment April 1.Scout's take: To best maximize his traits, the Buckeyes will need to deploy Henry on the outside. He's a one-on-one matchup problem on 50-50 balls whom Ohio State can maximize -- particularly in the red zone. Even when covered, he isn't really covered. Few wide receivers 6-foot-5 or taller can move, shake and produce after the catch like Henry. He shows an amazing run-and-catch aspect in the vertical passing game. Henry's long arms and ability to elevate in traffic create distinct advantages on jump balls. His twitchiness is very similar to that of Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins and sets him apart from other receivers at this size. -- Tom LuginbillJared Curtis, QB2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 6Committed to: Georgia BulldogsBackground: Initially committed to Georgia in March 2024, Curtis took a winding road back to the Bulldogs' 2026 class after he pulled his pledge and reopened his recruitment last October.Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, Ohio State, Oregon and South Carolina were all involved in Curtis' process earlier this year. Curtis narrowed his options to the Bulldogs and Ducks in February, ultimately closing his recruitment with a series of visits and in-home meetings with both programs this spring prior to his May 5 announcement. In the 6-foot-4, 225-pound passer, coach Kirby Smart once again has the cycle's second-ranked quarterback and a potential cornerstone for the program's future under center.Scout's take: Curtis will join a QB room at Georgia that is loaded with former ranked prospects and his move will likely send one or more of those players to the transfer portal. Curtis has ideal size at 6-3, 222 pounds and has tracked at 18.5 MPH Max Speed which is impressive for someone his size. His measurable standard in every category tested meets or exceeds every measure you'd like to have in a QB prospect.He has natural arm power, which is his best trait, and he makes throws from a lot of different arm angles. He has been clocked at a 4.8 40. He can be a crafty runner and use his athleticism, smarts and arm talent to make throws in and out of the pocket. -- LuginbillDerrek Cooper, RB2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 7Committed to: Texas LonghornsBackground: Cooper, ESPN's No. 1 running back in the 2026 cycle became the second-ranked member of the Longhorns' 2026 class when he announced his commitment to Texas over Georgia, Miami, Florida State and Ohio State on July 20.A versatile, pass-catching running back out of Florida's Chaminade-Madonna Preparatory School, Cooper did not take an official visit with the Longhorns this spring, but was ultimately swayed to Texas by running backs coach Chad Scott and the all-purpose role Steve Sarkisian's coaching staff presented him within the program's offense. With Cooper, the Longhorns hold more five-star pledges -- four -- than any other program in the 2026 class with No. 1 overall quarterback Dia Bell, defensive end Richard Wesley (No. 11 overall) and top-ranked outside linebacker Tyler Atkinson (No. 14) all sitting atop Texas' incoming recruiting class.Scout's take: Cooper is the most complete running back in this class. He has an outstanding blend of speed, power, agility and versatility. He is a big back at a little over 6-foot-1 and roughly 200 pounds with a powerful stride. Cooper is reminiscent of a former Longhorns rival, Adrian Peterson. With Cooper's build, he can run downhill and create yards after contact but also has the agility to make defenders miss with the proven speed to pull away when he gets in the open.His measurables make him an impressive back but it's other attributes that elevated him to five-star status. Cooper has impressed with his ball skill and route running ability and can be a weapon in the passing game, bringing versatility in how he can be aligned to attack defenses. Those attributes are accentuated by a competitive drive and his ability to quickly process coaching and apply it.Texas has a back in Quintrevion Wisner who has good size and is also a productive pass catcher who led Texas in rushing in 2024 while also finishing third in receptions. With Cooper, the Horns will bring in a runner in this mold but bigger and with better speed. There could be some overlap if Wisner returns in 2026, but either way the Longhorns have set themselves to replace an excellent and productive back with a player who can step into that role and impressively could have an even greater impact.Faizon Brandon, QB2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 8Committed to: Tennessee VolunteersBackground: Brandon committed to the Vols last August before totaling 2,159 passing yards and 27 touchdowns with one interception as a junior at Grimsley last fall.Brandon remains in near-daily contact with the Tennessee staff and has not engaged with other programs in 2025. He is focused instead on helping recruit a 2026 Vols class that already includes ESPN 300 pass catchers in wide receiver Tyreek King and tight end Carson Sneed. Brandon will take his official visit to Tennessee on June 20.Scout's take: The departure of Nico Iamaleava could allow Brandon to battle for the starting job sooner rather than later in a very quarterback-friendly system. Several recent Volunteers quarterbacks have similar stature, athleticism and arm strength. Brandon is more advanced than Hendon Hooker at the same stage and the pair share several traits. Brandon is also much more accurate than Joe Milton. While he lacks Iamaleava's polish at this stage, Brandon throws an exceptional deep ball, which is a requirement in this scheme that loves to attack vertically. -- LuginbillJaReylan McCoy, DE2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 9Committed to: Florida GatorsBackground: ESPN's No. 2 defender in the 2026 class has logged 18.5 sacks and more than 140 total tackles over three varsity seasons. If he signs with the Gators in December, he'll represent Florida's highest-ranked defensive addition in more than a decade.McCoy initially committed to LSU earlier this year before reopening his recruitment in February. He trimmed his list of finalists to Florida, LSU and Texas last month, then sealed his commitment to the Gators across a pair of visits with the program between May 30 and June 14. McCoy will join former No. 10 overall prospect L.J. McCray as the program's second five-star defensive end when he arrives on campus in 2026.Scout's take: The Gators finished last season strong, creating optimism for 2025 and beyond in the Billy Napier era. Part of the strong close was improved defensive play, and while further improvement and more consistency is needed among its front, Florida is stacking some excellent young talent to further fuel the excitement.Former ESPN 300 edge rusher signees Tyreak Sapp and Kamran James should help fuel their ascension, but defenders more recently added can boost this unit to another level. The hope is that McCray, a five-star in the 2024 class, will break out and several new high-ceiling D-line signings -- including No. 6 DE Jalen Wiggins -- can get involved.Florida is stopping there and now add to the mix another five-star defender in McCoy. A breakout performer during the Under Armour All-America week this past January, that setting showcased his impact ability. He has elite length with a big frame and has demonstrated a competitive \"alpha dog\" nature and plays with a motor. He has also shown good practice habits and all those traits are accentuated with his excellent physical tools. He moves well with good flexibility and has excelled in combine testing situations. He can develop into an disruptive, top pass rusher but can also play the run and be a factor in pursuit with his mobility.McCoy has shown all the tools, that with continued positive progress, would align with past top SEC defenders. With his build, size and competitiveness, he can offer versatility as he can pair with McCray at the Edge spot initially but could also play inside at DT.Tristen Keys, WR2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 10Committed to: LSU TigersBackground: Keys, ESPN's No. 2 wide receiver prospect, committed to LSU over Alabama, Tennessee and Texas A&M on March 19. He stands as the Tigers' top-ranked 2026 commit and the leaders of one of the nation's deepest wide receiver classes alongside fellow ESPN 300 pass catchers and LSU pledges Jabari Mack and Kenny Darby.However, Keys' recruitment might not be over. The 6-foot-3, 190-pound receiver took a series of official visits in June, and Miami, Tennessee and Texas A&M remain among the program's working hard to flip Keys, who hits the summer months as perhaps the top flip candidate among the committed five-star prospects in the 2026 class.Scout's take: Even if he's not an elite runner, Keys' combination of size, range and ball skills is unmatched. Former LSU receiver Brandon LaFell is a favorable comparison. The Tigers can use Keys' length, long arms and physicality to create matchup headaches for defenses either inside or outside. Keys has great body control and coordination on jump balls, making him a dangerous threat even when covered. He won't win a lot of open-field foot races, but Keys could develop into a go-to option if utilized in the slot against zone coverages or on the outside for deep balls. -- LuginbillRichard Wesley, DE2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 11Committed to: Texas LonghornsBackground: Briefly committed to Oregon in May, Wesley found a new home when he committed to the Longhorns on June 22 shortly after wrapping an official visit with the program. Wesley, a 6-foot-5, 250-pound pass rusher from Chatsworth, California, entered the ESPN 300 as a five-star prospect and the nation's No. 3 defensive end upon reclassifying from the 2027 cycle in March. He made unofficial visits to Ohio State, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Texas A&M and USC this spring before scheduling officials with Oregon and Texas in June. Upon his commitment, he joined five-star Longhorns quarterback Dia Bell (No. 6 overall) commit as Texas' second five-star pledge in 2026.Scout's take: Wesley has the most impact potential of any defensive line prospect coming out of the Southern California area since Kayvon Thibodeaux in 2019. He will join a talented D-line group in Texas' 2026 class. Headed to the SEC, he reminds us of a former disruptive defender in that conference -- former Ole Miss standout Robert Nkemdiche.Wesley has more ideal length but is a well put-together prospect with a nice blend of height and bulk. He can bring versatility in how he's used, with the ability to play on the edge and also produce inside and exploit favorable matchups with his blend of power and quickness.He reclassified from 2027 class to 2026 and when you see him in-person, it is clear he is able physically to make that jump and be ready to move onto college. He could be a quick contributor as well. He can continue to further improve flexibility, but he is an explosive defender with active and heavy hands who can attack with speed and power as a pass rusher and be able to set the edge.With national championship aspirations, the Longhorns turned to the transfer portal to restock their defensive line for 2025, but the future of this unit will be driven by youth with players like Wesley.His arrival is set to overlap with current standout edge defender Colin Simmons, whose presence could help Wesley ease into a role while still contributing and having an impact like Simmons did as a freshman in 2024. He could also pair nicely with 2025 signee five-star Justus Terry, who is in a similar mold to Wesley and the two could form a formidable pair for a defensive line unit that is adding the pieces to become one of the most talented in all of college football over the next few years. -- HaubertKendre' Harrison, TE2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 12Committed to: Oregon DucksBackground: Harrison kept a low recruiting profile after he committed to Oregon over Tennessee, North Carolina, Miami, Penn State and Florida State before officially shutting down his recruitment in March.A two-sport star who is committed to play basketball with the Ducks, now includes two other five-stars in offensive tackle Immanuel Iheanacho and safety Jett Washington. Harrison, North Carolina's second-ranked recruit in 2026, will be back on campus for an official visit with the Ducks in June.Scout's take: The tight end position played a pivotal role in Oregon fielding one of college football's best passing attacks in 2024, with Terrance Ferguson hauling in 43 catches. While Harrison won't arrive for another season, he'll help the Ducks reload at that spot and could supply even greater big-play ability.For Ferguson, the presence of Tez Johnson and Evan Stewart opened up more room to operate. Oregon's high-level recruiting should allow Harrison to enjoy a similar situation playing alongside No. 1 wide receiver Dakorien Moore. An excellent basketball player, the 6-foot-6 Harrison has elite height, length and a massive catch radius. Much like former basketball-to-football standouts Jimmy Graham, Antonio Gates and Julius Thomas, Harrison can high-point the ball and box out defenders in contested situations, giving Oregon another dangerous playmaker in the passing game. -- HaubertImmanuel Iheanacho, OT2026 ESPN 300 ranking: No. 13Committed to: Oregon DucksBackground: Initially set to announce his decision on Aug. 5, Iheanacho moved up his commitment and joined Kendre' Harrison and safety Jett Washington as the Ducks' third five-star pledge in 2026.Iheanacho, the 6-foot-7, 350-pound prospect from North Bethesda, Maryland, is ESPN's second-ranked offensive tackle in 2026. He took visits to each of Auburn, LSU, Oregon and Penn State this spring before solidifying his place as the second-ranked pledge in the Ducks' incoming class. After losing four-star pledge Kodi Greene (No. 38 overall) and missing on Miami commit and No. 1 offensive tackle Jackson Cantwell (No. 3) this spring, Ihenacho gives coach Dan Lanning and Oregon a much-needed cornerstone on the offensive line this cycle.Scout's take: The five-star is a huge addition for the Ducks, literally, as Iheanacho is a massive physical presence consistently measuring in at roughly 6-foot-6 and around 350 pounds. At this past January's Under Armour All-America game, mixed with many of the nations top juniors and seniors, Iheanacho physically stood out among that offensive line group. His large frame also comes with elite arm length and he uses it well with violent hands.His ranking though goes beyond just physical measurables as he also possesses good flexibility and not surprisingly is a powerful player. He is listed at tackle, but during that UA All-America week he worked at left tackle and left guard and could find a home, at least initially, at guard. At that spot, his size and power can be utilized while he further refines his footwork, but in the long run, he has exhibited to the tools to develop into an NFL-caliber lineman.The Ducks are utilizing the portal to build their O-Line for 2025 with several notable transfers added to that unit. Youth will play a role in the future though. In the 2025 class, the Ducks signed five-star OT Douglas Utu and now have Iheanacho and ESPN 300 guard, and former Cal commit, Tommy Tofi. -- HaubertTyler Atkinson, OLB2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 14Committed to: Texas LonghornsBackground: Coach Steve Sarkisian and the Longhorns landed one of the nation's most productive high school defenders when Atkinson, ESPN's top-ranked outside linebacker in 2026, announced his commitment to Texas over Georgia, Clemson and Oregon on July 15.Atkinson, a 6-foot-2, 215-pound prospect from Loganville, Georgia, has been credited with 483 total tackles and 31.5 sacks across three seasons at Grayson (Georgia) High School, where he led the program to a 6A state title in 2024. Not only does Atkinson arrive as the third five-star pledge for the Longhorns in 2026, but his commitment marks the second time Texas has beaten Georgia for a prominent local talent over the last 12 months after Sarkisian and Co. pulled 2025 five-star defensive tackle Justus Terry -- another longtime in-state target for the Bulldogs -- to Austin last December.Scout's take: Atkinson lacks ideal height and that kept him off the initial list of five-stars. However, he has assembled a body of work that proved he was deserving of a fifth star. He has adequate height and reach, and his physical upside is likely limited, but he has consistently shown what he can do with the physical tools he has.He has been a highly productive player posting over 150 tackles each of the last two seasons and over 50 TFLs. He has a powerful lower body and it shows in his play. He possesses an explosive burst with elite closing speed, and when he arrives at the ball, he can deliver a punishing pop as a tackler. With very good body control and explosiveness he can also be a disruptive pass rusher and moves well in space to be effective in zone coverage. We have seen Atkinson display a competitive nature and versatile skill set during in-person evaluation with his ability to work with the defensive line unit as well as with the linebackers in the course of one camp.Atkinson might not possess some of the same upside as others ranked as five-stars, but he looks poised to arrive at Texas and immediately jump into the mix. His ability to contribute quickly could nicely mirror another former five-star addition and the player he could likely end up replacing -- 2023 five-star Anthony Hill Jr. who made an impact as a true freshman. While Texas has a talented linebacker corps and will have options to replace Hill, Atkinson seems to be an ideal remedy at middle linebacker for the Longhorns when that spot calls for the next man up.Brandon Arrington, ATH2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 15Committed to: Texas A&M AggiesBackground: Considered among the fastest prospects in the 2026 cycle, Arrington landed as the cornerstone pledge of an increasingly deep Texas A&M recruiting class.Arrington, a 6-foot-1 sprinter from outside of San Diego, visited Penn State, Washington, Texas A&M, Alabama and Oregon before narrowing his recruitment to the Aggies and Ducks. With a combination of height, length and speed that Texas A&M coaches have compared to the build of former All-SEC cornerback Will Lee, Arrington carries the potential to develop into a first-round caliber defensive back at the next level. If he ultimately lands with the Aggies later this year, he'll join as the program's highest-ranked signee under coach Mike Elko and its top addition since defensive tackle David Hicks (No. 8) in the 2023 class.Scout's take: Arrington brings a lot of the same traits that Jaylen Mbakwe brought to Alabama last fall. He's a dynamic athlete who could play multiple positions but projects best on defense because of his length and elite level speed. Texas A&M is getting a smooth, fluid playmaker with excellent ball skills that should be able to find him a spot in the rotation sooner rather than later given his mature skill set and the fact he plays at a premium position that every program in America covets.Outside of Dezz Ricks, the majority of the depth, including starters at corner, are all upperclassman. Arrington is going to have to fight and scrap to prove that he's mature enough to make the jump because he's more than ready from a talent perspective. -- LuginbillElbert Hill, CB2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 16Committed to: USC TrojansBackground: ESPN's No. 1 cornerback prospect followed five-star offensive tackle Keenyi Pepe as the second five-star pledge in Trojans coach Lincoln Riley's star-studded 2026 class.Hill grew up two hours northeast of Ohio State and visited the in-state Buckeyes along with Alabama, Oregon and USC earlier this spring. But no program pushed harder to land Hill than the Trojans, who secured his pledge after a second spring visit to Southern California over the last weekend of April. As things stands, Hill is the highest-ranked pledge in the nation's deepest recruiting class and sits as the top prospect committed to an impressive USC defensive class in 2026.Scout's take: Hill is a total football player and very dynamic. He has grown almost two inches over the last few years, and is now 5-11, which has greatly enhanced his value on the perimeter. He's a leaper as well allowing him to mask some height deficiencies. He plays on both sides of the ball with tremendous ball and playmaker skills. Hill also has elite speed, posting a 4.4 laser 40 and 21.3 mph max speed. He reminds us of former USC standout Adoree Jackson, another smooth and quick footed shutdown corner. He could even be an option on offense. He's a premier player at a premium position and USC is continuing to make strides on defense. -- LuginbillKeisean Henderson, ATH2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 17Committed to: Houston CougarsBackground: Henderson remains one of the most intriguing quarterback prospects in the 2026 cycle and spent the spring holding off flip efforts from some of the nation's top programs despite his long-standing pledge to Houston, situated roughly 28 miles from his home in Spring Creek, Texas.Committed to the Cougars since May 27, 2024, Henderson has repeatedly emphasized his intention to stick with Houston during the early months of 2025. But those public rebuffs didn't keep programs such as Alabama, Auburn, Florida State, Georgia, Ohio State and Oregon from keeping in touch and Henderson even scheduled an official visit with Florida State before canceling his Seminoles trip and shutting his recruitment on June 5. He remains the top-ranked pledge in Cougars coach Will Fritz's second recruiting class at Houston.Scout's take: It's unclear whether Henderson pans out at quarterback or another position. His fundamentals are raw, but he's very competitive and productive. Henderson is similar to Duke transfer quarterback Darian Mensah, who was recruited by coach Willie Fritz to Tulane before Fritz took the Houston job. Landing Henderson is a significant pickup for the Cougars, even if he's not polished enough to make an immediate impact. He's a developmental player who needs more consistency in the passing game and more downfield arm strength. Henderson builds toward his top-end speed as opposed to being initially explosive. He has hit 20.6 mph on tape, which is a great time for a quarterback. Henderson has a high ceiling regardless of his position. -- LuginbillKeenyi Pepe, OT2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 18Committed to: USC TrojansBackground: Originally from Long Beach California, the 6-foot-7, 325-pound offensive tackle from Florida's IMG Academy is set for a return to Southern California as the top-ranked pledge in coach Lincoln Riley's 2026 class at USC.Pepe is one of four offensive tackles among 2026's five-star prospects. He took over as the starting left tackle at IMG Academy during his junior season last fall and stiff-armed the likes of Florida, Georgia, Miami and Texas to join the Trojans' incoming class, where he projects as a potentially foundational piece for the future on the offensive line.Scout's take: Now a member of the Big Ten, USC is working to strengthen its roster in the trenches. The Trojans' 2026 class already has double-digit commitments along the offensive and defensive lines. Now, Pepe becomes the highest-ranked player in the class. There will be some turnover of the offensive line heading into the 2025 season with redshirt sophomore Elijah Paige returning at left tackle. Aaron Dunn and Alex Payne, both 2025 linemen ranked in the ESPN 300, come in with the 2025 class to provide young depth at least. Combine them with Pepe in the 2026 class, and USC has retooled its offensive line with some impactful recruits.Coming out of IMG, Pepe is a prospect who has faced strong competition in practice and games. He gives the Trojans a big man who can play a key role early in his career much like Paige, who stepped in as a starter as a redshirt freshman last season. Pepe is a massive presence at roughly 6-foot-7 and 320 pounds with excellent arm length. He is more than just a big body as he is also light on his feet for his size and has good flexibility. He can continue to work on and be more consistent in some technical areas but demonstrated as a junior at the Under Armour All-America game that he is competitive, wants to learn and get better and can match up and battle against elite edge rushers. Pepe has the tools to be a starter and anchor the Trojans OL and could end up being a nice replacement for Paige at left tackle in the future. -- HaubertKaiden Prothro, TE2026 ESPN 300 ranking: 19Committed to: Georgia BulldogsBackground: Prothro was a priority in-state target for Georgia this spring, and ESPN's second-ranked tight end prospect followed quarterback Jared Curtis as the program's second five-star pledge in 2026 when he committed to the Bulldogs over Florida and Texas on July 12.Prothro is considered one of the nation's most versatile pass-catching prospects in the 2026 class. The 6-foot-7, 210-pound recruit from Bowdon, Georgia, has recorded 89 receptions for 2,034 yards and 35 touchdowns over the last two varsity seasons at Bowdon High School, where Prothro is also a standout baseball and basketball talent. He'll sign later this year as the next big name in the Bulldogs' vaunted tight end pipeline alongside fellow tight end pledges Brayden Fogle (No. 142 overall) and Lincoln Keyes (No. 238). Capable of filling multiple roles across the offense, Prothro will be a candidate to earn early snaps when he lands on campus in 2026.Scout's take: Ranked as a five-star at the tight end position, we're not completely sure how Prothro will be labeled on the Bulldogs roster -- and ultimately it doesn't matter. With his blend of size, speed, agility and body control, he can contribute in many ways, including having the tools to develop into a disruptive edge defender.But he'll be on offense, where he can be a big-play target either as a wide receiver or tight end. He possesses elite size, measuring in at little over 6-foot-6 and around 210 pounds with a broad frame that can support some additional mass. In addition to his size and length, he also presents a wide catch radius due to his body control and ability to adjust to the ball. But Prothro is more than just a big body, as he elevates to a five-star in part because of his fluidity and impressive speed; he has been measured hitting better than 21 mph in game play. All those assets make for a receiver who can align in multiple ways and present some form of a mismatch wherever he is.You have to go back to 2021 and George Pickens for the last time the Bulldogs had a receiver with these types of measurables. If they utilize Prothro more as a tight end, he could be a player in the Brock Browers mold as a receiving threat. Based on those comparisons, Prothro can be an impactful part of Georgia's offense. -- Craig HaubertFelix Ojo, OT2026 ESPN 300 ranking: No. 20Committed to: Texas Tech Red RaidersBackground: The Red Raiders' monster offseason of recruiting/transfer portal additions continued on July 4th when Ojo, ESPN's No. 4 offensive tackle prospects, announced his pledge to Texas Tech.After naming Florida, Michigan, Ohio State and Texas as his finalists, Ojo came back around on coach Joey McGuire and the Red Raiders. The 6-foot-7, 285-pounder did take an official visit to Lubbock in April, and Ojo will mark Texas Tech's highest-ranked all-time signee if he signs with the program later this year. Of note, Ojo is also set to join the Red Raiders on a fully guaranteed three-year, $5.1 million dollar revenue contract, believed to be one of the largest guaranteed deals in college football history.Scout's take: Of the four offensive tackles ranked within the five-star range, Ojo is the least likely to be a plug-and-play candidate when he steps onto campus. He is ranked highly because he has excellent raw tools and arguably the highest ceiling for development.He has elite length, consistently measuring in at 6-foot-6 with over an 80-inch wingspan and has shown he can use that length to his advantage. He is also a big man that has tested well and shows good flexibility. However, he is lean -- at least 30 pounds lighter than the rest of the five-star tackles and needs to pack on more mass once he gets into the Red Raiders' strength program. He can bend but needs to develop his footwork and be more consistent with his pad level and add the size to help counter power rushers.Joey McGuire created a buzz when he signed in-state five-star receiver Micah Hudson in 2024, and, while that big signing has not met expectations, Hudson is back in the program and there is time and a wealth of ability to utilize. McGuire now has done it again by landing another five-star prospect from within the state in Ojo. While it might take time for Ojo's impact to be felt, it is still a statement win on the recruiting trail. On the field, Ojo won't face the same immediate expectations that Hudson arrived with and that is good for Ojo and his development.The Red Raiders have worked the transfer portal well and their tackle spots will likely be manned by transfers backed up by a deep pool of freshmen within that unit. A larger spotlight will shine of Ojo at Texas Tech, but the Red Raiders still look likely to be in a position to give him some time to grow before needing to push him into action. If he develops, Ojo has the tools to be an all-conference, NFL-caliber tackle and anchor on the offensive line. -- HaubertJett Washington, S2026 ESPN 300 ranking: No. 21Committed to: Oregon DucksBackground: ESPN's No. 1 safety in the 2026 class, Washington committed to the Ducks over Alabama and USC on June 19, landing as the top-ranked defender in the program's 2026 class.Washington is the nephew of the late Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant and a two-sport star at Las Vegas powerhouse Bishop Gorman High School. He recorded 38 tackles and five interceptions during his junior season last fall before leading Bishop Gorman's basketball program to its second consecutive Nevada Class 5A state basketball title earlier this year.Jireh Edwards, S2026 ESPN 300 ranking: No. 23Committed to: Alabama Crimson TideBackground: A playmaking defensive back on one of the nation's top high school defenses, Edwards became the top-ranked member of the Crimson Tide's incoming class with his July 5 commitment to Alabama.After official visits to Auburn, Alabama and Georgia in June, Edwards canceled planned trips to Oregon and Texas A&M and narrowed his recruitment to the Tigers, Crimson Tide and Bulldogs. He joined Alabama as part of the program's late June/early July summer recruiting surge and now anchors an increasingly talented defensive class bound for the Crimson Tide in 2026.Scout's take: One of the more recent additions among the five-stars, Edwards has built a consistent resume to earn that ranking. He jumps out with elite size at 6-foot-2 and roughly 210 pounds and he accentuates those measurables with outstanding speed, having consistently posted 40 times at the 4.5 mark. With that, he has excellent range to quickly cover ground and uses his length to defend jump balls and also showcases good ball skills to make a play when opportunity is there. He also puts his size to use being a physical presence supporting the run. Edwards has excellent physical tools, but his rise was also spurred by demonstrating leadership qualities amongst his teammates when we have evaluated him, as well as a consistently focused competitive demeanor.Edwards brings excellent versatility to Alabama's defense. He can cover ground at safety, match up in coverage as well as come down and be a factor in the box. In a pinch he can line up at corner against bigger receivers, but he best projects at safety or at at Bama's Husky position -- a hybrid safety, linebacker position. -- Haubert</p>"

      "content": "<p>Paolo UggettiJul 20, 2025, 06:01 PM ETPORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- Hours before Scottie Scheffler sent his first Sunday tee shot into the air, tapped in for a kick-in birdie and began his 18-hole coronation, the player who last won The Open when it came to Portrush fired an iron 183 yards toward the fourth green and watched as his ball trickled in.The crowd erupted; Shane Lowry threw his hands in the air. When he turned toward his caddie, cameras caught his remark.\"This game,\" he said, \"will drive you mad.\"To nearly every player in the field this week, that adage about golf rings true in a different way. For Lowry, who wears his heart on his sleeve, the volatility of the sport he has dedicated his life to is palpable in his expression following every shot. For someone like Rory McIlroy, as he showed on Masters Sunday at Augusta this year, the emotion is an inextricable part of his game.Then there's Scheffler.Whenever he is on the golf course, his emotions appear guarded, as if he has placed them inside an encrypted safe only he knows how to unlock. Xander Schauffele described it as \"blackout\" mode -- the way Scheffler's flow state is one where he is in his own world, unbothered by anything else but hitting the next shot and hitting it better than anyone else could.Scheffler has, at times, given us glimpses of what seems to unlock his frustrations: a putt that breaks in a different direction than he thought; a wedge that doesn't go as far as he expected; a slope that doesn't make the ball react the way he thought it should. Rarely do those things throw him off his game.\"You won't see that much emotion as he continues to strike it like this,\" Jordan Spieth said. \"The only time you're going to see it is when he's on the greens if he misses putts because he's not missing many shots.\"On Sunday, Scheffler's final march on Royal Portrush was a masterclass, the latest display of his dominance on his way to his fourth major championship and the third leg of the career Grand Slam. It was further proof that Scheffler's approach to the game he continues to conquer is unlike anyone else's.\"I don't think we thought the golfing world would see someone as dominant as Tiger come through so soon,\" Schauffele said. \"And here's Scottie taking that throne of dominance. He's a tough man to beat, and when you see his name up on the leaderboard, it sucks for us.\"Throughout the day, Scheffler's path to victory looked stress-free to the naked eye. He prodded his way along for the first four holes, making three birdies and barely reacting as the crowd that was rooting for McIlroy couldn't help but feel defeated. On the fifth green, Scheffler calmly drained another birdie putt to go up by seven shots. All he got was a light smattering of claps. Then, when he left his approach shot on the par-3 sixth hole short of the green, the galleries cheered his misfortune.Scheffler chipped up to the surface, stared down the 16-footer for par and made it. A vicious, Tiger-like fist pump ensued. It was the biggest display of emotion Scheffler had shown all week.\"Bloody hell,\" one fan said under his breath.\"This is over,\" another added.It had been over for a while, perhaps as early as Friday when Scheffler shot 64. For some, that reality was just now settling in.\"The crowd, I think, wanted somebody else to win this week,\" Scheffler said. \"And I kind of got to play spoiler a little bit, which was fun as well.\"Unlike the Masters, where he is now a favorite of the patrons and the green jackets, here Scheffler is more like an unknown force from outer space. Fans have watched his greatness from afar, heard much about his inevitability. But on Sunday, as most rooted for a miracle from McIlroy, they got to witness the kind of hopelessness Scheffler's game can produce.By the time he reached the 18th green and his margin of victory was four, the Northern Ireland crowd -- thousands strong -- had no choice but to give him a standing ovation.\"He's been on a different level all week,\" McIlroy said. \"He's been on a different level for the last two years. He is the bar that we're all trying to get to.\"The history Scheffler is creating with his shuffling golf swing and the comparisons to Tiger he shies away from are one thing, but what he has done to give the sport a Goliath that every one of his peers is trying to take down is perhaps even more impressive.When Woods dominated, the gulf he created between him and everyone else was widened further by his athletic ability compared with the rest. Today, everyone on tour prioritizes fitness. Nearly everyone hits it far and high, and everybody uses the same modern equipment to their advantage. This homogeny isolates two things: consistency and mental approach. Over the past three years, no one has been more consistent, and no one has approached the pursuit of greatness quite like Scheffler. On Sunday, he once again explained his philosophy.\"This is amazing to win the Open Championship, but at the end of the day, having success in life, whether it be in golf, work, whatever it is, that's not what fulfills the deepest desires of your heart,\" Scheffler said. \"Am I grateful for it? Do I enjoy it? Oh, my gosh, yes, this is a cool feeling. ... It's just tough to describe when you haven't lived it. It's something I actually talked to Shane about this week was just because you win a golf tournament or accomplish something, it doesn't make you happy.\"When the final putt dropped on 18, Scheffler hugged his caddie, Ted Scott, and allowed himself a smile. Then Scheffler turned to his family rushing to meet him by the green, and he finally broke character. He took off his white Nike hat, raised both arms in the air and, as his face contorted in ecstasy, let out a yell.play1:14Scheffler's putt to win the Open ChampionshipWatch Scottie Scheffler's winning putt to claim his first Open Championship title.Scheffler has told us time and time again that this -- the trophies, the praise, the comparisons to Tiger, the historic achievements -- do nothing to fulfill him. Being a father, a husband, does. Take him at his word or don't -- hints of what makes him the way he is were present all throughout that 18th green Sunday.As his family awaited his return for the trophy ceremony, Scheffler's son, Bennett, played around in the grass with a plastic club. His mom, Diane, and wife, Meredith, took in the moment while his dad, Scott, pulled out his phone and recorded the scene -- the fans surrounding the green, the iconic yellow Open scoreboard that read \"Scheffler -17.\"Scott chatted up the marshals nearby, sharing childhood stories of Scottie, raving about how he bounced back from the double bogey on No. 8, acknowledging the company his son now keeps in golf history while preaching the same kind of message his son has espoused at every turn.\"He doesn't ever think about that, he never has. He's just like, 'At the moment, I'm good at what I do,'\" Scott said. \"I always told him the joy was in the journey. You never know what you'll find along the way.\"As Spieth put it, \"He doesn't care to be a superstar. He's not transcending the game like Tiger did. He just wants to get away from the game and separate the two. I think it's more so the difference in personality from any other superstar that you've seen in the modern era and maybe in any sport. I don't think anybody is like him.\"In some ways, that's a convenient approach. But with Scheffler it doesn't take long to understand that it's real. Unlike Woods and many other players before him, Scheffler does not crave the spotlight; he tries his best to repel it. Yet his game can't help itself -- it continues to place him there.\"There's two Chipotles that I eat at [at] home,\" Scheffler said. \"There's one right where I grew up, kind of near SMU's campus. If I was to go to that Chipotle and try to eat nowadays, it would be very difficult for me. There's another one in a different part of town that I'm not going to tell you where it is, but if I go there, nobody recognizes me ever.\"As the sun went down on the summer night in Portrush, Scheffler returned to the 18th green as the most famous man in the arena for the trophy ceremony. Soon the words were coming out of R&A CEO Mark Darbon's mouth.\"The champion golfer of the year, Scottie Scheffler.\"His family members looked at each other and smiled.\"I don't think I'm anything special just because some weeks I'm better at shooting a lower score than other guys are,\" Scheffler said. \"In some circles, like right now I'm the best player in the world. This week I was the best player in the world. I'm sitting here with the trophy. We're going to start all over in Memphis, back to even par, show goes on.\"Scheffler is right. The show will go on, but the evidence continues to pile up: The game everyone else can't always seem to bend to their will is the one he is breaking.</p>"

And that's something I can't deal with,\" Tretter told CBS Sports on Sunday. \"So, the short bullet points are: I have no interest in being [executive director]. I have no interest in being considered. I've let the executive committee know that. I'm also going to leave the NFLPA in the coming days because I don't have anything left to give the organization.\"Tretter, 34, had been in the role since October 2024. He was the player president from 2020 to 2024 and reportedly was a candidate to serve as the interim executive director after Lloyd Howell's resignation last Thursday night.Several former NFL players reacted to Tretter's candidacy with public criticism on social media.\"We've gotta be the dumbest Union in all of sports,\" former linebacker Will Compton posted on X early Sunday. \"Ya -- let's vote for the guy who was in charge of hiring Lloyd Howell. Lets vote for the guy who swept a lot of s--- under the rug when NFL owners were colluding to not give out guaranteed contracts. The NFLPA is constantly outmatched and it's truly our own doing.\"\"They would be wise to remove Tretter as well,\" former player and NFLPA executive committee member Ben Watson posted Saturday.Tretter was the NFLPA's player president in 2023 when Howell was elected as the union's executive director. Tretter presided over a vote that changed the NFLPA's constitution to make the search and election process more confidential. He led the 16-month search process that resulted in Howell, whose leadership had come under question in recent weeks after reports from the \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" podcast and ESPN over matters that included a controversial confidentiality agreement with the NFL and Howell's strip club expenses.In 2022, the NFLPA sued the owners, alleging that they were colluding to prevent guaranteed contracts. In 2023, the NFL sued the union over Tretter's comments that suggested that running backs who were unhappy with their contracts could fake injuries -- a violation of the collective bargaining agreement. Both grievances were decided this year, and both decisions were not shared publicly by either the NFL or the NFLPA. ESPN reported that the NFLPA and the NFL had a confidentiality agreement for the collusion grievance that hid the information within the 61-page decision.In an interview with CBS Sports, Tretter denied having access to the collusion grievance or being involved in the agreement struck by the union and the league to keep those findings confidential to a select group of executives.The NFLPA's board of player representatives will meet Sunday night to discuss candidates for interim director, a source with knowledge of the situation told ESPN. NFLPA chief player officer Don Davis, executive director of the NFLPA trust Zamir Cobb and NFLPA associate general counsel Ned Ehrlich are among the candidates who will be discussed.The board of representatives also will discuss the selection process for the next executive director, including whether the executive committee or the interim director will lead that task.</p>"

Volpe responded with a sacrifice fly to the warning track after Chisholm might have tipped off his teammate that a fastball was on its way from Montero.It is legal in MLB to relay signs, provided it is done naturally and without electronic communications. But Perez, according to MLB.com, was telling Chisholm to think about his actions, a strategy that might have been viewed as a threat to Chisholm, a warning that next time he's at the plate, he might get hit with a pitch.\"I was just saying, 'Be smart.' I like that guy. He's one of my favorites,\" Perez told MLB.com, in reference to Chisholm. \"And he got mad about it. I don't know why he got mad about it. So, I was like, 'Take it easy,' and he started doing some [stuff].\"Yankees manager Aaron Boone addressed the issue Sunday morning, before his club's 4-2 victory in the series finale. Chisholm, who had no comment regarding Perez on Sunday, went 2-for-4 with an RBI in the win.\"Every team now, from the start of the year to the end, you're trying to find little advantages out there. You're trying to find little ways to help you win a ballgame,\" Boone said. \"That's all within the parameters of the rules. Every team we play against is no different, and we're not either. So, you're constantly trying to find advantages where you can and where they present themselves in a certain game. That's all good.\"When asked about the potential threat, Boone told reporters that \"obviously, there's no place for that. That's certainly something that would not be OK.

He joined ESPN in 2010.OXNARD, Calif. -- Dallas Cowboys Pro Bowl guard Tyler Smith is not shy about what he expects in 2025 as training camp begins this week.\"Super Bowl champions,\" Smith said as the team arrived in Oxnard, California, after its flight from Dallas. \"That's always the expectation.\"The Cowboys have not played in a Super Bowl since 1995. They haven't reached an NFC Championship Game in the past 30 years, the longest drought in the conference after the Washington Commanders and Detroit Lions made it each of the past two years. The Cowboys finished 7-10 last year and will have a rookie head coach in Brian Schottenheimer replacing Mike McCarthy.\"I think it's a realistic goal, yeah,\" Smith said.Why?\"Because we can win a Super Bowl. Why not? Why can't we win?\" he said. \"Do you think it's unrealistic?\"Before 2024, the Cowboys finished 12-5 three straight seasons but lost to the San Francisco 49ers (twice) and Green Bay Packers in the postseason. The Cowboys acquired wide receiver George Pickens from the Pittsburgh Steelers in a trade to bolster the group alongside Pro Bowl wideout CeeDee Lamb. Dallas added linebackers Kenneth Murray Jr. and Jack Sanborn, defensive tackle Solomon Thomas and pass rusher Dante Fowler Jr in free agency. The Cowboys acquired former first-round pick Kaiir Elam, a corner, from the Buffalo Bills, as well.Dallas will also have a healthy Dak Prescott, who missed nine games last year because of a hamstring avulsion but is cleared for full activities in camp. When Prescott has played more than half of the team's games, the Cowboys have made the playoffs in five of seven years.\"I think we built a great core on offense; the addition of George and all the other key pieces,\" Smith said. \"I think drafting [guard Tyler] Booker [in the first round], he's going to be a hell of a guy just to bolster the front line. And we have many guys across the board, but those are some of the guys who are the key pieces on what we do this year.\"Perhaps the biggest key will be pass rusher Micah Parsons, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract and looking for an extension that likely will make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. There has been no recent dialogue between the two sides. Parsons can take the team charter to California, but he does not have to officially report until Monday for the start of training camp.Parsons said during June's minicamp that he would attend camp, but he did not indicate if he would practice. Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones will hold his State of the Cowboys news conference Monday. Parsons' contract and the team's bid for a Super Bowl appearance likely will be top of mind.</p>"

He joined ESPN in 2024 after covering the University of Oklahoma for Sellout Crowd and the Tulsa World.Days after landing No. 1 outside linebacker Tyler Atkinson, Texas secured its latest five-star addition Sunday when coveted rusher Derrek Cooper, ESPN's No. 1 running back in the 2026 class, announced his commitment to the Longhorns.Cooper, a 6-foot-2, 205-pound recruit from Chaminade-Madonna Preparatory School in Hollywood, Florida, is the seventh-ranked prospect in the 2026 ESPN 300. After an unofficial trip to Texas in April, Cooper did not officially visit the program before choosing the Longhorns over finalists Florida State, Georgia, Miami and Ohio State on Sunday night.Cooper's father told ESPN that the presence of Longhorns running back coach Chad Scott, who replaced former assistant Tashard Choice in February, and the all-purpose role Texas coach Steve Sarkisian laid out for Cooper in the program's offense were leading factors in his son's decision.\"They've talked about his skill set and compared his build to [former UT running back] Bijan Robinson,\" Corey Cooper told ESPN. \"They don't have a running back like Derrek right now. They feel like they can do a lot with him.\"Derrek Cooper is the fourth five-star pledge in the Longhorns' 2026 class and continues a summer recruiting tear for the Longhorns, who have added 10 ESPN 300 commits since June 1.Cooper's commitment comes days after Texas edged Georgia for the pledge of Atkinson -- No. 14 in the 2026 ESPN 300 and the No. 1 prospect in the state of Georgia -- then flipped four-star Bulldogs defensive line commit James Johnson (No. 123 overall) later in the day.Cooper is the second-highest ranked of six top-100 recruits committed to Sarkisian's incoming class, joining Atkinson, fellow five-star pledges Dia Bell (No. 4) and Richard Wesley (No. 11), and four-stars John Turntine III (No. 43) and Samari Matthews (No. 99).A gifted two-way star at Chaminade-Madonna Prep, Cooper trails only fellow Texas pledge Bell -- ESPN's No. 1 quarterback in 2026 -- as the second-ranked recruit in Florida this cycle.Cooper was credited with 124 carries for 905 yards and 13 touchdowns as a junior last fall while leading Chaminade-Madonna Prep to a 1A state championship. In 2024, he added 46 total tackles and four sacks on defense, where he was a linebacker and safety.Cooper will join a potentially crowded running back group next year with as many as five current Texas rushers eligible to return in 2026. However, with elite pass-catching ability out of the backfield, Cooper's versatility could create early opportunities in a Longhorns offense that has routinely found clever ways to use skill position talents under Sarkisian.\"He wants to run, he wants to be able to catch the ball out of the backfield, he wants to line up at wide receiver,\" Cooper's father said. \"He wants to show he has all the skills to play at the next level, and they're going to let him do that at Texas.\"Upon Cooper's pledge, defensive end Jake Kreul (No. 22 overall) stands as the last uncommitted player among ESPN's 23 five-star prospects in 2026. Savion Hiter and Davian Groce, ESPN's No. 2 and No. 4 running back prospects, respectively, are the only uncommitted running backs in the 2026 ESPN 300.</p>"

      "content": "<p>ESPN News ServicesJul 20, 2025, 01:42 PM ETPORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- Scottie Scheffler may not find his life's true fulfillment in winning, but that's not going to keep him from continuing to do it on the sport's biggest stages.Scheffler had all the time in the world to celebrate his latest major title, carding a 68 on Sunday to cruise to a four-stroke victory in the Open Championship at Royal Portrush.The outcome was never in doubt Sunday, as golf's No. 1 player finished at 17-under 267, delivering yet another dominant performance to win his second major this year and grab the third leg of the career Grand Slam.Scheffler tapped in for par on the final hole, making it all look so routine. But then Scheffler saw his family -- wife Meredith, 15-month-old son Bennett, and his parents -- and thrust both arms into the air, pumped both arms and tossed his cap in the air. That's what it was all about for the 29-year-old from Texas, who gets to keep the silver Claret Jug for a year.\"He is the bar that we're all trying to get to,\" Masters champion Rory McIlroy said. \"In a historical context, you could argue that there's only maybe two or three players in the history of the game that have been on a run the one that Scottie's been on here for the last 24 to 36 months. Incredibly impressive.\"American Harris English, who arrived in Britain two weeks ago without his caddie, and Chris Gotterup, who flew over without a plane ticket for Ireland, finished second and third, respectively.Scheffler became just the fourth player in Open Championship history to shoot 68 or better in all four rounds, joining Collin Morikawa (2021), Henrik Stenson (2016) and Jesper Parnevik (1994).\"Being able to walk up 18 with the tournament in hand is a really tough thing to describe. It's a really cool feeling,\" Scheffler said. \"I have a lot of gratitude towards being able to accomplish something like this.\"It's taken a lot of work -- not only a lot of work, but it takes a lot of patience. It's a high level of focus over 72 holes of a tournament. This was, I felt like, one of my best performances mentally.\"The start of Scheffler's final round was ideal. From the first cut of rough, Scheffler hit his approach to the right side of the green on the slope. The ball trickled back and then rolled down to 10 inches from the cup for a tap-in birdie.Scheffler already won the PGA Championship by five shots this year. He won the Masters last year by four shots and the Masters in 2022 by three shots. Before Sunday, no one had ever won each of their first four major titles by three shots or more.He also became just the third golfer to win multiple majors by four or more strokes in a single year, joining Ben Hogan (Masters, U.S. Open, The Open in 1953) and Tiger Woods (U.S. Open, The Open in 2000).Scheffler has won 20 times worldwide since February 2022, and this was the 11th straight time he turned a 54-hole lead into a victory.\"I don't think we thought the golfing world would see someone as dominant as Tiger come through so soon, and here's Scottie sort of taking that throne of dominance,\" said Xander Schauffele, who tied for seventh.\"You can't even say he's on a run. He's just been killing it for over two years now. He's a tough man to beat, and when you see his name up on the leaderboard, it sucks for us.\"Scheffler arrived in Northern Ireland and shared some extraordinary insight when he said celebrating tournament wins doesn't last but for a few minutes before it was on to the next one. He said he loves the work required to be the best and that he thrives on competition, but in terms of fulfillment, he said he often questions why he wants to win so badly when the thrill of winning is fleeting.There was just one wobble on Sunday. Scheffler's tee shot on the par-4 eighth found a bunker, and he got too aggressive, with his next shot hitting the top of the vetted side and rolling back into the bunker.He got the next one out safely into the fairway, hit wedge to 18 feet and took two putts for a double bogey -- ending his streak of 32 consecutive holes without a bogey.Scheffler then drilled his drive on No. 9, hit wedge to 5 feet for birdie and he was back on his horse. He played the back nine with eight pars and a birdie because that's all he needed. No one could catch him.\"I played with him the first two days, and honestly I thought he was going to birdie every hole. It was incredible to watch,\" Shane Lowry said. \"If Scottie's feet stayed stable and his swing looked like Adam Scott's, we'd be talking about him in the same words as Tiger Woods. ... His bad shots are really good. That's when you know he's really good.\"The only other stumble from Scheffler came from his 15-month-old son, who tried to walk up a slope to the 18th green toward his dad and the Claret Jug, only to face-plant.\"I don't think he's ever been up a hill that big before,\" Scheffler said with a laugh.It was an extraordinary test for Scheffler because of the cheers, not all of them for him. There was pure adulation for McIlroy, playing before a home crowd in Northern Ireland. He started the round six shots behind, needing his greatest closing round in a major and help from Scheffler, but McIlroy wound up seven back in a tie for seventh.\"I wish I had have been closer to Scottie going into today and been able to make a real push,\" said McIlroy, who became just the sixth player to win the career slam earlier this year. \"But he's been on a different level all week and he's been on a different level for the last two years to the rest of us.\"English shot a closing 5-under 66 on Sunday to secure a second runner-up finish to Scheffler at a major this year, after the PGA Championship in May. One of the best years of his career could yet include an appearance in the Ryder Cup at New York in September.Gotterup's last two weeks on the links have been life-changing. As the world No. 158, he outlasted McIlroy to win the Scottish Open last week and earn a late qualifying berth for the Open Championship where, on his major debut, he shot weekend rounds of 68 and 67 to finish third.In the space of eight days, Gotterup has earned around $2.7 million -- double his career earnings. Oh, and it was his 26th birthday on Sunday, too.\"I don't know what's going on over here,\" said Gotterup, whose family roots are Danish, \"but maybe my European blood in me a little bit has come to life.\"English finished at 13 under, despite being without longtime caddie Eric Larson, who couldn't get a travel visa for the U.K. because of prison time served 20 years ago. Instead, his short-game coach, Ramon Bescansa, was on the bag.\"Ramon and I did a great job of coming up with a strategy,\" the No. 19-ranked English said. \"He kind of knows how I operate.\"English is now just outside the automatic qualifying positions for the American Ryder Cup team\"Hopefully I can get in that top six to lock up a spot,\" he said.Haotong Li of China (70), Matt Fitzpatrick (69) and Wyndham Clark (65) tied for fourth. That gets Li into the Masters next year.The Associated Press and ESPN Research contributed to this report.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Associated PressJul 20, 2025, 04:48 PM ETCLEVELAND -- President Donald Trump is threatening to hold up a new stadium deal for Washington's NFL team if it does not restore its old name of the Redskins, which is considered offensive to Native Americans.Trump also said Sunday that he wants Cleveland's baseball team to revert to its former name, the Indians, saying there was a \"big clamoring for this\" as well.The Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians have had their current names since their respective seasons in 2022, and both have said that they don't plan to change them back.Trump said that the Commanders would be \"much more valuable\" if they restored their old name.\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump said on his social media site.His latest interest in changing the names reflects his broader effort to roll back changes that followed a national debate on cultural sensitivity and racial justice. Washington announced it would drop its former name and logo in 2020 during a broader reckoning with systemic racism and police brutality.The Commanders and the District of Columbia government announced a deal earlier this year to build a new home for the football team at the site of the old RFK Stadium, the place the franchise called home for more than three decades.Trump's ability to hold up the deal remains to be seen. President Joe Biden signed a bill in January that transferred the land from the federal government to the District of Columbia.The provision was part of a short-term spending bill passed by Congress in December. Though D.C. residents elect a mayor, a city council and commissioners to run day-to-day operations, Congress maintains control of the city's budget.Josh Harris, whose group bought the Commanders from former owner Dan Snyder in 2023, said earlier this year that the name was here to stay. Not long after taking over, Harris quieted speculation about going back to the former name, saying that would not happen. The team did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Trump's social media posts Sunday.The Washington team started in Boston as the Redskins in 1933 before moving to the nation's capital four years later.Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti indicated before Sunday's game against the Athletics that there weren't any plans to revisit the name change.\"We understand there are different perspectives on the decision we made a few years ago, but obviously, it's a decision we made. We've got the opportunity to build a brand as the Guardians over the last four years and are excited about the future that's in front of us,\" he said.Cleveland announced in December 2020 that it would drop its Indians nickname. It announced the switch to Guardians in July 2021. In 2018, the team phased out \"Chief Wahoo\" as its primary logo.The name changes had their share of supporters and critics as part of the national discussions about logos and names considered racist.Trump posted Sunday afternoon that \"The Owner of the Cleveland Baseball Team, Matt Dolan, who is very political, has lost three Elections in a row because of that ridiculous name change. What he doesn't understand is that if he changed the name back to the Cleveland Indians, he might actually win an Election. Indians are being treated very unfairly. MAKE INDIANS GREAT AGAIN (MIGA)!\"Matt Dolan, the son of late owner Larry Dolan, no longer has a role with the Guardians. He ran the team's charity endeavors until 2016.Matt Dolan was a candidate in the Ohio U.S. Senate elections in 2022 and 2024, but lost.Washington and Cleveland share another thing in common: David Blitzer is a member of Harris' ownership group with the Commanders and holds a minority stake in the Guardians.</p>"

He posted 38 points, 16 rebounds and 12 blocks for Maine United and the following day, Flagg went for 37 points, 12 rebounds and 10 blocks. He guided Maine United to the title game, but the team lost to Cameron Boozer and NightRydas Elite. Flagg averaged 25.4 points, 13 rebounds, 6.9 blocks and 5.7 assists in the event. A month later, Flagg reclassified to the 2024 class. He was named Gatorade National Player of the Year and led his high school team to the Chipotle Nationals title as a senior. He then dominated at Duke before being selected with the No. 1 pick by the Dallas Mavericks in the 2025 draft.</p>\n\n<p>Jalen Green, Phoenix SunsIn 2019, Green led Team Why Not (California) to the Peach Jam title game, averaging 23.7 points, 4.3 rebounds and three assists. Green, the top high school prospect in the ESPN 100 for 2020, showed the full range of his athletic capabilities with viral dunks throughout the week. He was named high school player of the year during his senior season and was selected with the No. 2 pick by the Houston Rockets in the 2021 NBA draft.Cameron Boozer, DukeIn 2024, Boozer helped NightRydas Elite (Florida) become the first grassroots team to win consecutive Peach Jam championships at the 15U, 16U and 17U levels after defeating the Oakland Soldiers (California) 71-62. Boozer dominated the event, capping his week with 19 points (7-of-8 from the field), 10 rebounds and 5 assists in the title game. Boozer, who was ranked No. 3 in the ESPN 100 for 2025, was named the Gatorade National Player of the Year in his senior year.Trae Young and Michael Porter Jr., Atlanta Hawks/Brooklyn NetsGood luck finding a better Peach Jam tandem than Young and Porter, who both were spectacular during the 2016 event. The duo led Mokan Elite (Kansas) to an undefeated Peach Jam run in dominant fashion. Young posted 27 points, 7.2 assists and 3.8 rebounds, and Porter pumped in 26.4 points, 11.4 rebounds and three steals. Young, who was ranked No. 23 in the ESPN 100 for 2017, led the country in points and assists as a freshman at Oklahoma before being picked fifth by the Dallas Mavericks and immediately traded to the Atlanta Hawks in 2018. Porter, who was ranked No. 2 in the class, was selected No. 14 in the same draft by the Denver Nuggets.</p>\n\n<p>Jayson Tatum, Boston CelticsTatum was a devastating three-level matchup problem in 2015, leading the St. Louis Eagles (Missouri) to the title game while averaging 24.1 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.6 assists. His combination of size and skill made him a one-man highlight reel as he led Chaminade College Prep (Missouri) to its second straight state title and claimed the Gatorade National Player of the Year award. Tatum thrived at Duke, averaging 16.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.1 blocks before being taken with the third pick by the Boston Celtics in the 2017 draft.Isaiah Briscoe, former NBA guardBriscoe, who was nicknamed \"Must-See TV,\" led the NJ Playaz to the Peach Jam title in 2014. His combination of speed, quickness and mind-boggling ballhandling made him nearly impossible to defend. Briscoe, who was ranked No. 13 in the ESPN 100 for 2015, averaged 19.2 points, and five assists a game at Peach Jam, where he posted 20 points, 12 rebounds and 7 assists in the championship game.

That was after suspicious betting was reported on his 4-0 defeat against Joe Perry in February that year at the Welsh Open. Perry was not accused of any wrongdoing.King has always denied the charge and lost an appeal in May. He was ordered to pay more than £113,000 in costs.He was found guilty of match-fixing in November 2024 and suspended until March 2028.The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association said \"there was no more serious breach of the rules than betting related match fixing\" and it had \"a long track record of thoroughly investigating such allegations\".The WPBSA added there was evidence King had been involved in fixing match results.\"In this case there was strong evidence against King that necessitated action under the WPBSA's Conduct Regulations. This was vindicated by the findings of two independent KC Chaired Tribunals,\" a statement added.Strain on familyKing, a former Northern Ireland Open champion, said the situation had put a strain on his family. \"I think the hardest person affected is my wife. She had a pacemaker fitted not long after the investigation started,\" he added.\"It's really took a toll on her.\"The Essex player, who climbed to 11th in the world in 2003, is a recovering gambling addict.He said he has struggled with poor mental health since first being suspended.The WPBSA said the mental well-being of players was always a priority. \"From the start of this case Mark King was offered a full range of support,\" it said.\"This was both continued pastoral support, including the availability of counselling therapy through Sporting Chance, the Mental Health & Wellbeing partner of WPBSA Players, and signposting to pro-bono legal advice to ensure that he had access to informed and independent guidance.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mark King said fellow player Mark Williams reached out to himAfter receiving his suspension, King said he received a phone call from three-time world champion Mark Williams and a few other professional players.\"One of the first players that rang me straight away was Mark Williams,\" King said.\"He said, 'listen, I don't care what's going on. I'm just ringing up to see how you are'. That's a proper friend, we've known each other a long time.\"King said he was struggling to pay the costs. \"Well, I obviously haven't got £113,000 in my back pocket for a start,\" he said.\"I'm out of work because obviously I'm a 51-year-old man. I did a little bit of a labouring job but that was a bit too much for me.\"He said he was not sure if he would return to the sport when his suspension was lifted in just under three years.\"I honestly don't know at this time,\" he added. \"I love playing and I love the life of it and travelling all around the world and playing but at the same time I still feel hurt and angry.\"More on this story</p>"

He was 55.The former Surrey player will be remembered on the second day of the fifth Test at the ground where he had a 17-year county career. That day, 1 August, would have been his 56th birthday.In a nod to the trademark headband Thorpe wore while batting, headbands designed by his wife Amanda and daughters Kitty and Emma will be sold to raise money for mental health charity Mind.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Amanda said: \"That day will be very powerful. We want to celebrate him and his memory. His light was so bright. He'll go on.\"Kitty added: \"Death and grief in general isn't talked about enough, considering it happens to everyone. It surrounds us. When you add the layer of death by suicide, that makes it even more taboo.\"I understand it's difficult to talk about - people don't want to say the wrong thing. That doesn't help tackle the stigma around it. We need to change the way we're addressing the topic. That's why we're working with Mind to do something to help that.\"Media caption, Graham Thorpe's wife and daughters want to celebrate his memoryThorpe famously became the first England batter for 20 years to score a hundred on their Test debut when he reached three figures against Australia at Trent Bridge in 1993.A stylish left-hander, Thorpe would go on to become one of only 17 men to reach 100 Test caps for England, scoring 6,744 runs at an average of 44.66.Following his playing career, he held coaching roles with Surrey and England. He was part of the England staff during the taxing 2021-22 Ashes in Australia, played under Covid restrictions. He was let go after England lost that series 4-0.He was named head coach of Afghanistan in March of 2022, then made a first attempt on his life in May of the same year, subsequently spending a prolonged period in intensive care.\"Working in the Covid bubbles, he found that tough,\" said Amanda. \"He wasn't great at following rules at the best of times. He would turn up for a team dinner in the wrong clothes, that is if he turned up at all.\"The last tour he did when he was coaching, the Ashes, that was a really hard tour because there were still full Covid restrictions.\"It was all very stressful and he wasn't great on that trip. Then he came back, and, as happens, his job ended, then he got offered another job. It was hard for him, probably harder than we knew. He got a lot worse then, very quickly, actually.\"Thorpe died on 4 August last year.\"It was impossible not to notice his spark and whole personality changed, over time to almost unrecognisable,\" said Kitty. \"It was awful to see. What started as a mental illness turned into a physical illness.\"Over two years he aged about 15 years. He looked really weak. He found the most easy, menial tasks so challenging, like making a meal or walking the dog. He started struggling to even do that. He lost his strength.\"We tried many different treatments, but nothing worked for him.\"In the run-up to 'A Day for Thorpey', Amanda has visited 'Bat and Chat' in Burton-upon-Trent - an initiative from Mind designed to support mental health through cricket.The sessions are to be renamed 'Thorpey's Bat and Chat' and funds raised from the day at The Oval will be used to roll them out across the country.\"My dad was quite a private person, so for us to share his and our experience is important to help other people who have gone through similar things,\" said Emma.\"To start a conversation, to reduce the shame and stigma there are around these conversations.\"Kitty added: \"Our key message is to speak up and reach out for help early on. There is help out there. It needs to be spoken about more.\"There are great charities like Mind and many more. Hopefully over time this will grow, there will be more help and services. That's what we're raising money for.\"If you're affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations who can help via the BBC Action Line.More on this story</p>"

Farrell will wear 12 in a team which also features the fit-again Blair Kinghorn at full-back and two new arrivals in Jamie Osborne and Darcy Graham at centre and wing respectively.The bench also contains a number of players bussed in as cover for a fixture that has reignited the debate over whether it dilutes the honour of Lions’ representation to call up replacements players primarily on geographical grounds. The Scottish trio of Ewan Ashman, Rory Sutherland and Gregor Brown have been all been named on the bench after being summoned from New Zealand where Scotland have been playing.The Leinster and Ireland prop Thomas Clarkson is another new face while there is a bench return for Garry Ringrose, ruled out of first Test contention with delayed concussion symptoms. “This fixture gives players another opportunity to put their hand up for selection for the final two Tests,” said Andy Farrell, whose side won the first Test 27-19 in Brisbane on Saturday.“The coaches’ minds are open when it comes to selection. They have to be with so many players performing and pushing for places, and we want that to continue for the remaining two Tests. This group know the level of performance that we will require against a First Nations [and] Pasifika team that is packed with talent and power.”First Nations & Pasifika XV captain Kurtley Beale kicks the ball during the captain’s run in Melbourne. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesThe 36-year-old Kurtley Beale will captain a First Nations & Pasifika XV which also contains Taniela Tupou and Filipo Daugunu, both released from the Wallabies squad for the fixture by head coach Joe Schmidt.The ex-Wallaby forward Pete Samu will not feature, however, because he did not fulfil the strict criteria in the tour agreement that all players involved should have been involved in this season’s Super Rugby competition. Samu helped Bordeaux win this year’s Champions Cup and has returned home to join the Waratahs but the Lions management declined to make an exception for him.Toutai Kefu, the First Nations & Pasifika head coach, is nevertheless hopeful that his side will be competitive. “The team has a really nice feel to it, with a blend of not only youth and experience, but also cultures,” he said. “The Lions have shown how strong they are on this tour ... but we’re not here to make up the numbers.

But in perhaps the first sign of a passing of the baton, Owen looked comfortable facing both the West Indies pacers and spinners, and clubbed six stunning sixes to reach 50 from 26 balls.The 23-year-old was caught on the boundary from the next ball after raising his bat, but by then Australia were back in control and only needed 15 more runs. Cameron Green was just as critical to rebuilding the Australia innings as he carried over his reasonable form from the Test series with 51 runs from 26 balls that included five sixes and two boundaries.Mitch Owen hits a six for Australia against the West Indies at Sabina Park. Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesWest Indies were left to wonder what could have been after getting off to a flyer with half-centuries to captain Shai Hope and Roston Chase taking them to 159 for two in the 16th over. When Hope lofted a slower ball from debutant Owen to point when on 55, and with Chase already back in the pavilion, the hosts soon looked shaky after a target beyond 200 had seemed much more likely. The collapse that followed might not have been to the depths of the recent red-ball horror show, but losing six wickets for a scarily familiar 27 runs allowed Australia to chase an achievable target.This was the first of Australia’s 16 T20 internationals over the next four months as they seek answers to their questionable form in the shortest format ahead of the T20 World Cup early next year. Greater depth, power-hitting options and flexibility within games are among the more obvious concerns as white-ball specialists and emerging players were handed an opportunity to impress at Sabina Park. Green and Josh Inglis were the only survivors from the 13 players used to claim a 3-0 Test series sweep, while the West Indies could take some early relief from Australia resting all of their formidable red-ball attack.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionWith Dwarshuis and Abbott posing fewer problems with the new ball, Brandon King returned to the top of the order in place of the injured Evin Lewis and set out to ensure that the West Indies left the third Test humiliation behind them. King was one of seven batters to be dismissed for a duck in a fourth-innings total of 27 last week, but back in his preferred format the opener clattered four boundaries from the first two overs of the game. When King stepped down the pitch once too often and was stumped for 18, Chase came to the crease and took little time to blast Australia’s spinners out of the attack.The all-rounder made next to no impact with his own off-breaks in the three-Test series but looked like a different player with the bat as he smashed his fastest T20I half-century. Chase reached 60 from 32 balls with a pair of sixes and nine boundaries before becoming the first of Dwarshuis’s four victims when picking out Maxwell just inside the rope at long-on.Hope moved through the gears to keep the run-rate above 10 an over with Shimron Hetmyer (38 from 19) lending valuable support. But when Owen made his first critical intervention to dismiss the skipper, the West Indies crumbled and Dwarshuis soon claimed three lower-order wickets in an over as the hosts’ dream of a hint of redemption was gradually lost.</p>"

Styles made his long-awaited return to TNA Wrestling at Sunday's Slammiversary, his first appearance with the company since 2014. Approximately 7,000 fans in attendance came unglued as \"Get Ready to Fly,\" Styles' old TNA theme song, blared through the speakers at UBS Arena in Elmont, New York. Styles hit the stage shortly after Leon Slater, 20, defeated Moose to become the youngest X-Division champion in history. \"TNA, did you miss me?\" Styles said as the crowd cheered, \"Welcome home!\"</p>\n\n<p>Styles, the inaugural X-Division champion, congratulated Slater on the milestone, saying the division has a bright future with him. The hot crowd called for \"one more match.\" Styles, 48, did not formally commit to another TNA run but said, \"We'll get to that.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's not clear if Styles' appearance was a one-off or if he'll continue making TNA appearances. WWE and TNA announced a multi-year partnership in January. The partnership has primarily resulted in a talent exchange between TNA and NXT, though former TNA world champion Joe Hendry notably appeared at the Royal Rumble and WrestleMania this year.Earlier on Sunday, Styles reflected on his journey from TNA to multiple WWE championship reigns.\"If I had the ability to go back in time, I'd tell  myself, 'You have no idea how far this ride's about to take you. All the ups, the downs, the doubts -- they're gonna shape you into one of the best in the world. Don't lose that chip on your shoulder, but learn when to let go of your pride. You're gonna walk into places you never thought you'd belong… Way better than you could imagine. Stay humble, stay hungry, and trust God's timing—it's perfect, even when it doesn't feel like it. You're not just phenomenal. You're built for this,'\" Styles wrote.Styles, still an active WWE superstar, competed primarily for TNA  between 2002 and 2014. \"The  Phenomenal\" one was a cornerstone of the  promotion's innovative  X-Division. He's TNA's first triple crown and  grand slam champion, an achievement that includes five world heavyweight  title reigns.</p>\n\n<p>Styles contributed to many classic matches.

      "category": "general",
      "content": "<p>The Year of the Catcher continues! With the trade deadline looming, we've been hoping the Braves would look to move Sean Murphy to clear up one of the most frustrating playing time gluts at the position, but they came up with a different solution to that problem: Why not play both? With DH stalwart Marcell Ozuna looking no closer to breaking out of his multi-month slump, the Braves started both Murphy and Drake Baldwin in two of the final three games of the first half and then did the same thing to open the second half, with Ozuna only starting Sunday's series finale against the Yankees. That's not quite everyday playing time for both Baldwin and Murphy if it sticks, but it's more than enough to make both viable starting Fantasy options in basically all formats. When they were mostly just splitting starts behind the plate, neither quite looked like a one-catcher league starter, but now they might both be. And they both deserve it.Murphy, the veteran, is hitting .239/.325/.517 with 16 homers in just 62 games, while Baldwin brings a bit less pop to the plate (11 homers in 67 games) but has been a better source of batting average, sporting a .283/.355/.480 line for the season. That's an easy 20-plus homer pace for both of them, with Murphy enjoying a bounceback season that has him on pace for 30-plus if he got enough opportunities.And I'm thinking both should get enough opportunities moving forward. Whether that comes from a trade of Murphy – which is still possible, per reports – or because the Braves find a taker for Ozuna, an impending free agent,, or just stick with Ozuna being a part-time player, I think we're going to see both Baldwin and Murphy get enough playing time to be in that one-catcher-league mix. So, if you're looking for an upgrade, go check and see if Baldwin (43% rostered in CBS Fantasy leagues) or Murphy (41% rostered) are available.</p>\n\n<p>Here's who else we're looking to add ahead of Week 18 of the Fantasy Baseball season.   Week 16 Waiver TargetsFirst BaseJac Caglianone, Royals (72%) – This remains a bet on a supremely talented player who has shown flashes turning those flashes into production at some point. He didn't exactly tear it up coming out of the break, with two hits in two games, but Caglianone still hits the ball hard and doesn't strike out as much as you might think (19% in July), so I'm still going to believe in him figuring it out at some point soon. Deep-league target: Andrew Vaughn, Brewers (18%) – I don't know how much of this is because of what he's done since joining the Brewers, but I'm kind of shocked at how decent Vaughn's underlying data looks right now. He's striking out around an average clip and has a .267 expected batting average and .477 expected slugging percentage on the season, with above-average quality of contact metrics pretty much across the board. He's been a disappointment for so long that it's fair to be skeptical, but it's also possible a change of scenery is just what the former top prospect needed.</p>\n\n<p>Second baseOtto Lopez, Marlins (68%) – Lopez has slowed down in July, but it still kind of speaks to how productive he's become that \"slowing down\" still means three homers, a steal and 12 RBI in 15 games. He makes a lot of contact which helps lead to a .293 expected batting average, and there's been a lot more pop than expected here, with a .495 expected slugging percentage. Lopez probably deserves to be more widely rostered than this. Deep-league target: Luke Keaschall, Twins (30%) – Keaschall began his rehab assignment Friday after recovering from a fractured forearm, which means he's probably going to be back in the Twins lineup in the next week or so, and that's very exciting. The 22-year-old only played in 23 games between Triple-A and the Majors before his injury, but he showed a knack for getting on base and wreaking havoc when he gets there, stealing nine bases in those 23 games, including five in seven in the majors. That kind of pace is unsustainable, but the green light here could make Keaschall a big-time contributor in steals, and his .881 career minor-league OPS suggests he won't just be a speed specialist, either.Third baseNoelvi Marte, Reds (72%) – Marte has hit .231 since coming back from the IL, but he's done just about everything else right. In 12 games since his return from injury, Marte has three homers and a steal, and while the batting average is poor, it comes with just an 18% strikeout rate, which suggests better days should be ahead. Marte has been making solid amounts of contact all season without sacrificing power, and is looking like the top prospect we were all so excited about a few years back. At this point, the biggest obstacle seems to be just staying on the field, but he's healthy right now.</p>\n\n<p>Deep-league target: Brady House, Nationals (29%) – House didn't come to the majors with a ton of hype, but he's starting to show that he belongs. After striking out 25% of the time in June, he's cut that down to 18.4% in July, while hitting .292/.306/.458. You'd like to see more patience and/or power from him, but House is holding his own as a 22-year-old in the majors, and his .330 xwOBA for the season suggests he's probably had a fair bit of bad luck come his way so far. He could be a viable corner infielder if his .305 xBA is at all for real.ShortstopEzequiel Tovar, Rockies (49%) – It was frustrating to see the Rockies give Tovar the day off Sunday after he had what looks like a coming out game Saturday with three hits and a homer, but I suppose it's good to see them being proactive with Tovar's health after such a long layoff due to an oblique injury. It's also good to see a big game from him in just his second game back from an injury that has a tendency to linger even when guys get fully healthy. Tovar was universally rostered coming into the season and was coming off a .333/.379/.574 line in May before the injury, so I think at least in categories leagues he needs to be rostered. Deep-league target: Ha-seong Kim, Rays (25%) – I'm genuinely surprised at how slowly Kim's roster rate is climbing. I've found him to be pretty overrated for Fantasy over the years, to be fair, but he's also been viewed as a must-roster option in the past. He hasn't been great to open the season, but with three steals in nine games, he's doing what we've always valued him for – and on an aggressive Rays team, I do expect him to be a very healthy source of steals. He played all three games this weekend coming out of the break and should be an everyday player moving forward – and he appeared in his second game at second base Sunday, which would only help his Fantasy outlook if he can get three more appearances there quickly. At least in categories leagues, Kim feels like he needs to be more widely rostered than this.</p>\n\n<p>OutfieldChandler Simpson, Rays (60%) – Since his return from Triple-A, Simpson is the No. 25 outfielder in Roto leagues, just behind Julio Rodriguez and Pete Crow-Armstrong. Okay, but that's his best format, and points leagues are probably the majority of the leagues where he isn't rostered, right? Well, he's the No. 30 outfielder in points leagues since his promotion, and he has started 20 of 22 games in that span – including as a leadoff hitter in four straight. He might just be worth rostering in all formats. Austin Hays, Reds (55%) – I mean … he's hitting .389/.337/.540. He's on a 30-plus homer pace. He's averaging 3.4 Fantasy points per game, a mark only 11 outfielders are doing better than. He's ahead of, among others, Cody Bellinger, Jackson Chourio, Brent Rooker, George Springer, Riley Green, Christian Yelich, and … well, almost everyone else. I'm saying all this to say I think the burden of proof is on all of you to tell me why Hays shouldn't be universally rostered. Or just add him. Tyler Freeman, Rockies (42%) – There's very little power here, and Freeman isn't going to drive in many runs as a result. But he does enough else well that I still think he's way under-rostered right now. In Roto leagues, the appeal is obvious – he's hitting .324 with 12 steals in 56 games, and neither part of that looks like a fluke. But even in points leagues, I think he's underrated, thanks to his exceptional plate discipline (more walks than strikeouts on the season) and eligibility at both outfield and second base.</p>\n\n<p>Evan Carter, Rangers (58%) – Carter has slowed down since June, when he hit .333/.421/.530. He hasn't it a homer since June 12 and has just four in 44 games, with the kind of poor quality of contact metrics that make me think maybe he'll never be an impact power hitter – though his career-high 111.1 mph average exit velocity this season is at least one reason for optimism. But he has managed to get on base at a solid clip and has been aggressive when he gets on, stealing 12 bases, including four already in July. He's not the superstar we once hoped he would be, but Carter looks like a solid No. 4 or 5 outfielder in categories leagues. Owen Caissie, Cubs (14%) – Caissie has been around long enough that there is probably some prospect fatigue going on around him – he's been one of the top outfield prospects in baseball since he reached Double-A back in 2023. He has now played 202 games at Triple-A and is more than ready for the bigs, with 38 homers and an .875 OPS to his name. The Cubs don't have anywhere to play him right now, but Caissie feels like one of the more obvious names to be traded at the upcoming deadline, and I suspect whichever team does acquire him will slot him right into their MLB outfield, so we should be mere weeks from Caissie's debut. Starting pitcherZebby Matthews, Twins (45%) – You know what: I don't care that Matthews gave up five runs in his first start back from the IL. I don't. I almost always treat the first start back from a month-plus long absence as a mulligan, and this one was at Coors Field, which makes it even tougher to judge. And, despite the poor showing, Matthews still did a lot worth getting excited about, including inducing 17 whiffs on his 77 pitches. His velocity was fine coming off a shoulder injury, so I think we'll see a lot more good than bad from Matthews moving forward. My optimism remains undimmed.</p>\n\n<p>Quinn Priester, Brewers (74%) – 10 strikeouts? Against the Dodgers? Okay, the Dodgers lineup has been kind of mediocre for a while now with both Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts stuck in some of the longest and deepest slumps of their Hall of Fame careers. Still, 10 strikeouts against the Dodgers! Priester has a 2.45 ERA in eight appearances (six starts) since June 1, with 48 strikeouts to just nine walks in 44 innings of work, so this isn't just a one-start, flash-in-the-pan kind of thing. Eric Lauer, Blue Jays (40%) – I don't quite understand how Lauer is getting away with this, but that's now three straight starts with at least six strikeouts and no more than two runs allowed. His season ERA is down to 2.80, he has more than a strikeout per innings, and his 3.06 xERA suggests it isn't a fluke. I have my doubts that it'll last, and his next matchup against the Tigers has me pretty wary. But he'll be in line for a two-start week against the Orioles and Royals the following week, and that should be pretty useful for Fantasy. Dean Kremer, Orioles (55%) – It's pretty wild how well Kremer is pitching right now. He started turning things around in May, but then gave up nine runs across consecutive starts to open June and I figured he was back to being a non-entity for Fantasy. But in six starts since he has a 2.00 ERA with 33 strikeouts in 36 innings of work. This turnaround has coincided with Kremer throwing his cutter less and his splitter more, and that's probably not a bad decision given the significantly better results with both swings and misses and quality of contact allowed on the splitter. Maybe he can keep it up.</p>\n\n<p>Nestor Cortes, Brewers (45%) – There are a lot of pitchers on the IL worth stashing, and I'd probably prioritize Shane Bieber, Shane McClanahan, and Kyle Bradish ahead of Cortes if I'm looking for more long-term upside. But Cortes is working his way back from an elbow injury and looks like he's a bit closer than the rest of those guys from returning, having thrown 5.1 innings in his most recent rehab start Friday in Triple-A. He's probably going to make one more start before returning, and if we write off his early-season struggles as being a result of the injury, there's still a path for him to be pretty useful for Fantasy – he had a 3.77 ERA and 1.15 WHIP in 174.1 innings last season. Relief pitcherBrandon Walter, Astros (34%) – Walter just continues to shine. He tossed his second quality start in a row Friday against the Mariners and has now thrown five in eight tries since joining the rotation in late May. He has a really strong 25% strikeout rate and pairs it with elite control (1.6% walk rate) and good results on balls in play (.359 xwOBA on contact), which helps explain the strong 2.95 xERA he carries. I think this probably isn't sustainable, but Walter is pitching at a very high level right now and it's worth riding the hot hand. Kevin Ginkel, Diamondbacks (17%) – The Diamondbacks haven't had a lot of save opportunities since Shelby Miller went on the IL, with Anthony DeSclafani's three-inning save Sunday just the team's second in the month of July. That makes it hard to say that Ginkel is definitely the team's closer, but I'm pretty sure that's how it's going to end up in the long run. He has finished the game out in three of his last five appearances, with his two others coming in the eighth and ninth inning. If you're looking for saves in Arizona, I think this is where you'll find them.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The 2025 NASCAR Cup Series has featured both an international and grassroots flair</p>\n\n<p>Jul 20, 2025</p>\n\n<p>at</p>\n\n<p>8:15 pm ET</p>\n\n<p>•</p>\n\n<p>4 min read</p>\n\n<p>Getty Images</p>\n\n<p>From humble beginnings in the Carolinas and across the Southeast, NASCAR has grown into not only the most popular form of auto racing in the United States, but also one that can attract the intrigue and attention of the rest of the world. And the places that NASCAR seeks to go, but also the place where it came from, is reflected in where its premier division will be racing in 2025.The 2025 NASCAR Cup Series season features familiar stops from the superspeedways of Daytona and Talladega to the sport's most iconic tracks like Darlington, Charlotte and Martinsville, but also two new additions to the schedule both near and far away. The year began with Chase Elliott winning The Clash at the legendary Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, N.C., while Shane van Gisbergen would win at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, scoring the win in the first international Cup Series race in NASCAR's modern era and the first overall since 1958.After a spate of road course races, Shane van Gisbergen's third win of the season at Sonoma tied him with Kyle Larson, Denny Hamlin and Christopher Bell for the most wins among drivers this season. But the tiebreaker was broken at Dover, as Denny Hamlin earned his fourth win of the year and took total control of the winningest driver mark as the fight to be the No. 1 seed in the playoffs continues.</p>\n\n<p>NASCAR at Dover results: Denny Hamlin fends off Joe Gibbs Racing teammates for his fourth win of 2025</p>\n\n<p>Steven Taranto</p>\n\n<p>Among the other major changes to the remaining schedule this year include:Nashville  Superspeedway's race date moves from late June to the beginning of  June, immediately following the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte. Michigan and  Pocono return to June dates as well.Sonoma and Dover's race dates have both been moved to July. Iowa Speedway's race date has been moved from June to August.Mexico City's date has come at the expense of Richmond Raceway, which will now have just one race weekend in August.Atlanta,  Watkins Glen and Homestead-Miami have been moved out of the playoffs,  with Gateway and New Hampshire moved into the playoffs instead. The  Southern 500 at Darlington has also returned to being the  playoff-opening race, and the Coke Zero Sugar 400 is once again the  regular-season finale after a scheduling quirk because the Olympic break pushed the season forward a week.Talladega  Superspeedway's playoff race has been moved into the Round of 8, with  that race now set to potentially determine a place in the Championship  4.In the Xfinity and Truck Series, the legendary Rockingham  Speedway has returned to the schedule in both series for the first time  since 2004 and 2013, respectively. The Truck Series also gains an  entirely new racetrack with NASCAR's first-ever trip to Lime Rock Park  in Connecticut.2025 NASCAR Cup Series schedule(* -- Denotes non-points race)Feb. 2 -- Cook Out Clash -- Bowman Gray Stadium* (Winner: Chase Elliott)Feb. 16 -- Daytona 500 -- Daytona International Speedway (Winner: William Byron)Feb. 23 -- Ambetter Health 400 -- EchoPark Speedway (Winner: Christopher Bell)March 2 -- Echopark Texas Grand Prix -- Circuit of the Americas (Winner: Christopher Bell)March 9 -- Shriners Children's 500 -- Phoenix Raceway (Winner: Christopher Bell)March 16 -- Pennzoil 400 -- Las Vegas Motor Speedway (Winner: Josh Berry)March 23 -- Straight Talk Wireless 400 -- Homestead-Miami Speedway (Winner: Kyle Larson)March 30 -- Cook Out 400 -- Martinsville Speedway (Winner: Denny Hamlin)April 6 -- Goodyear 400 -- Darlington Raceway (Winner: Denny Hamlin)April 13 -- Food City 500 -- Bristol Motor Speedway (Winner: Kyle Larson)April 27 -- Jack Link's 500 -- Talladega Superspeedway (Winner: Austin Cindric)May 4 -- Wurth 400 --Texas Motor Speedway (Winner: Joey Logano)May 11 -- AdventHealth 400 -- Kansas Speedway (Winner: Kyle Larson)May 18 -- All-Star Race -- North Wilkesboro Speedway* (Winner: Christopher Bell)May 25 -- Coca-Cola 600 -- Charlotte Motor Speedway (Winner: Ross Chastain)June 1 -- Cracker Barrel 400 -- Nashville Superspeedway (Winner: Ryan Blaney)June 8 -- FireKeepers Casino 400 -- Michigan International Speedway (Winner: Denny Hamlin)June 15 -- Viva Mexico 250 -- Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez (Winner: Shane van Gisbergen)June 22 -- The Great American Getaway 400 -- Pocono Raceway (Winner: Chase Briscoe)June 28 -- Quaker State 400 -- EchoPark Speedway (Winner: Chase Elliott)July 6 -- Grant Park 165 -- Chicago Street Course (Winner: Shane van Gisbergen)July 13 -- Toyota/Save Mart 350 -- Sonoma Raceway (Winner: Shane van Gisbergen)July 20 -- Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 400 -- Dover Motor Speedway (Winner: Denny Hamlin)July 27 -- Brickyard 400 -- Indianapolis Motor SpeedwayAug. 3 -- Iowa Corn 350 -- Iowa SpeedwayAug. 10 -- Go Bowling at the Glen -- Watkins Glen InternationalAug. 16 -- Cook Out 400 -- Richmond RacewayAug. 23 -- Coke Zero Sugar 400 -- Daytona International SpeedwayNASCAR playoffsRound of 16</p>\n\n<p>Aug. 31 -- Cook Out Southern 500 -- Darlington RacewaySept. 7 -- Enjoy Illinois 300 -- World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway (St. Louis, Missouri)Sept. 13 -- Bass Pro Shops Night Race -- Bristol Motor SpeedwayRound of 12Sept. 21 -- USA Today 301 -- New Hampshire Motor SpeedwaySept. 28 -- Hollywood Casino 400 -- Kansas SpeedwayOct. 6 -- Bank of America ROVAL 400 -- Charlotte Motor Speedway RovalRound of 8Oct. 12 -- South Point 400 -- Las Vegas Motor SpeedwayOct. 19 -- YellaWood 500 -- Talladega SuperspeedwayOct. 26 -- Xfinity 500 -- Martinsville SpeedwayChampionship</p>\n\n<p>Nov. 2 -- NASCAR Cup Series Championship -- Phoenix Raceway</p>"

      "content": "<p>Despite being at a disadvantage on tires over the final runs of the race, Denny Hamlin put on a defensive driving clinic to go back-to-back at Dover Motor Speedway, winning the Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 400 for the second year in a row. Hamlin's win on Sunday is the 58th of his Cup career and his fourth of 2025, giving him more wins than any other driver in Cup this season.Following his final pit stop, Hamlin was left with tires that were several laps older than Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Christopher Bell's, putting him at a disadvantage on grip as Bell began to close in. With the threat of rain looming and the laps winding down, Hamlin began making his car wide, doing all he could to block the flow of clean air to Bell's and bog him down in dirty air off his car.</p>\n\n<p>NASCAR 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks, locations</p>\n\n<p>Steven Taranto</p>\n\n<p>Hamlin held on long enough to be out front when the rains came, but the shower passed quickly enough that it allowed NASCAR to dry the racetrack and run the final 13 laps. Hamlin fought off Bell again on a restart -- in a battle that ended with Bell spinning off turn 4 -- but he was quickly confronted with another JGR teammate in Chase Briscoe, who had pitted for fresh tires after the red flag lifted and went on a tear all the way to second by double overtime.</p>\n\n<p>Briscoe was able to drive alongside Hamlin on the final restart, but couldn't clear him before getting loose to Hamlin's inside coming to the white flag. That break in momentum was all Hamlin needed to drive away on the final lap and complete his Dover defense.</p>\n\n<p>\"Winning here in Dover is super special to me,\" Hamlin told TNT Sports. \"This is a place that I have not been very good for at the first half of my career. And to have back-to-back over the last few years is amazing. ... I just studied some of the greats here. I was very fortunate to have Martin Truex as a teammate, Jimmie Johnson, watching him win 10 times here... You learn from the greats and you change your game to match them, and you have success like this.\"Briscoe would have to settle for second, followed by Alex Bowman, Kyle Larson and Ty Gibbs rounding out the top five. The rest of the top 10 consisted of Chase Elliott, Bubba Wallace, Ryan Blaney, Chris Buescher and Brad Keselowski, with Wallace's seventh-place finish being particularly important. Wallace's top 10 finish and overtime troubles for Ryan Preece (who finished 19th) allowed Wallace to pad his advantage over the playoff cut line to 16 points with five races to go in the regular season.Meanwhile, the final laps saw a massive development in the In-Season Challenge and the continuation of the tournament's biggest Cinderella story. After a race-long battle in his semifinal matchup with John Hunter Nemechek, Ty Dillon would finally gain the edge when he received the free pass after the first caution of overtime, putting him back on the lead lap while Nemechek remained a lap down.</p>\n\n<p>With a 20th-place finish, Dillon -- the No. 32 and final seed in the In-Season Challenge -- advanced to the final round of the tournament, where he will race Gibbs (who won his matchup against Tyler Reddick) for a $1 million prize in next weekend's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis.</p>\n\n<p>Ty Dillon, star of NASCAR's In-Season Challenge, regaining confidence and having fun again as Cup driver</p>\n\n<p>Steven Taranto</p>\n\n<p>Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 400 results#11 - Denny Hamlin#19 - Chase Briscoe#48 - Alex Bowman#5 - Kyle Larson#54 - Ty Gibbs#9 - Chase Elliott#23 - Bubba Wallace#12 - Ryan Blaney#17 - Chris Buescher#6 - Brad Keselowski#8 - Kyle Busch#45 - Tyler Reddick#71 - Michael McDowell#22 - Joey Logano#3 - Austin Dillon#2 - Austin Cindric#7 - Justin Haley#20 - Christopher Bell#60 - Ryan Preece#10 - Ty Dillon#42 - John Hunter Nemechek#38 - Zane Smith#47 - Ricky Stenhouse Jr.#35 - Riley Herbst (R)#34 - Todd Gilliland#99 - Daniel Suarez#43 - Erik Jones#21 - Josh Berry#41 - Cole Custer#88 - Shane van Gisbergen (R)#24 - William Byron#4 - Noah Gragson#1 - Ross Chastain#44 - J.J.
