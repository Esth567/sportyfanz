Football Daily might even have watched it on S4C due to our commitment to the underdog and love of Welsh commentary. “There is one thing everyone can be proud of through the club, it’s that everyone gave everything that they had,” chirped manager Craig Harrison. “No one could give anything more and sometimes that’s all you can ask.” There was greater cruelty for Lithuania’s Zalgaris, who last won a two-legged Big Cup tie in 2000, as they were sent packing by Malta’s mighty Hamrun Spartans 11-10 on penalties after 28 spot-kicks. It is the first time a Maltese side have made it beyond this round, becoming part of football history in the process.</p><p>Even in defeat there can be triumph. Andorra’s national team are ranked 173rd in the world, therefore when their best and brightest, Inter Club d’Escaldes, drew Romanian giants FCSB, who won the competition back in the 1986 by beating Barcelona, when they were known as Steaua, no one gave them a chance. Inter Club d’Escaldes obviously lost over two legs because FCSB possess the former Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches and ex-Port Vale man Dennis Politic. Respectfully beaten 3-1 in the Romanian capital, a lesser team would have given up and gone through the motions. But Inter Club could not let down the 509 fans inside the Nou Estadi Encamp and ran out 2-1 winners, exiting by a single-goal margin. The names of Sascha Andreu and Alexandre Llovet will be sung on the streets of Escaldes–Engordany for years to come.</p><p>Dynamo Kyiv, Slovan Bratislava and Crvena<strong> </strong>Zvezda enter in the next round, readying themselves to bring their lesser-known rivals back down to earth and restore the natural order at the top of the second qualifying round tree. Come May, the ending will doubtless be the same given that the biggest clubs win the biggest prizes, but the summer months provide a reminder that football is more than just millionaires battling for trinkets and there is still glory to be had for those other professionals who can say they are Bigger Cup players.

Months of waiting, for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid\" target=\"_blank\">Joel Embiid</a> to play, for him not to play, for him to decide what, if anything, he wants to say about a season that once seemed so full of promise.</p><p>We're in his piano room. He's leaning back on a couch that seemed spacious until he eased his long body onto it. He's wearing a matching set -- pinstriped shorts and a camp collar shirt. His son, Arthur, peeks around corners from the hallway to see what we're up to. His wife, Anne de Paula, is upstairs preparing for her birthday celebration that evening. Decorations are being arranged in his dining room. It's the end of March, nine days before the knee surgery that will have a lot to say about Embiid's basketball fate.</p><p>He used to have fun with interviews. Before he ever played a game in the NBA, while he spent two years on the shelf rehabbing from surgeries to his right foot in the summers of 2014 and 2015, he was a media darling, both wry fabulist and helpless confessor.</p><p>But not after this past year. These days, he's wary, a little distracted by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\" target=\"_blank\">Phillies</a> game he's watching on his phone. I wonder if he may politely show me the door. We make small talk for a bit. He looks bored.</p><p>He does this with new people -- gives little of himself, pretends not to watch while he weighs and measures.</p><p>I ask if we can start, on the record. He agrees.</p><p>Embiid has many reasons to call this off. He thinks explaining himself will be distorted into defending himself, which will be caricatured as complaining. And look around -- his second child, a daughter, is on the way. His parents are taken care of. His family is secure for generations. He's an inspiration in Cameroon.</p><p>We're inside his lavish stone colonial, a mansion that sits perched atop a gently sloping hill in the Philadelphia suburbs. The hand towels in at least one of his 11 bathrooms are monogrammed with his initials -- what does he have to complain about?</p><p>\"I care about how I'm going to be remembered when it comes to basketball, but not as a man,\" Embiid says. \"As a man, you can't tell me nothing.\"</p><p>We're a few feet from each other, and I find myself edging forward in my chair to hear him. His voice is so small it seems to emphasize his other dimensions. This is the inward, solitary Joel Embiid, known by very few.</p><p>His friends are protective, verging on paranoid. They see Embiid as he sees himself, as someone beset on all sides. Which is to say, they love him on his terms.</p><p>\"When you have his trust, it's kind of intoxicating,\" one says. \"It's like you just penetrated this force field that nobody gets to be in.\"</p><p>So I ask him right away, \"Who do you trust?\"</p><p>\"Hmm,\" Embiid says, seconds of silence passing by. \"I mean, uhh.\"</p><p>He looks at me, a sharpening of his attention seems to ask: <i>What do you think you know? </i></p><p>\"I've never been the one to have a lot of friends,\" he says finally. \"And even then, with the ones that I consider close, I never try to go deep into anything.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I ask.</p><p>\"A quiet family. Dad, extremely quiet. Mom, quiet too. ... From the moment that I was really young, you could never really open up about anything.\"</p><p>He expects me to understand. We're both from the same part of the world, neighboring countries in West and Central Africa. We run through our short diaspora litany together: Beatings. Demanding fathers. Mothers more than their match.</p><p>What it is to be loved by such people: \"You know they love you. ... But it is not all love like, 'Come here and give me a hug.' That's not happening. I never got any of that.\"</p><p>The need to defend them: \"The way I was raised is also one of the main reasons why I'm here.\"</p><p>The need to renounce them, too: \"The way I was raised is not the way I'm raising my kids.\"</p><p>Maybe it's the background we share. Maybe it's because he started therapy in the fall. Maybe it's the six months he's spent in the basketball void -- his fans on the verge of mutiny, his relationship with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\" target=\"_blank\">76ers</a> shot through with strife, the late prime of his career interrupted by a lost season at 31 years old, just as he seemed to attain the full flowering of his brilliance -- maybe now he <em>needs</em> to talk.</p><p>Everyone else is. The Embiid discourse, let's call it; a narrative meant to assign a verdict of blame for why Embiid's transcendent ability has not produced a championship or even a Finals appearance. And there are summary statements bubbling now, too, career obituaries. The Ringer, citing his injuries, recently ranked Embiid -- who was league MVP in 2023 -- as the 84th best player in the NBA. Bleacher Report has him at 66th all-time.</p><p>After surgery to repair his meniscus last February, Embiid spent the 2024-25 season either recovering from or playing through pain. He played just 19 games and looked like himself in only a fraction of those. Now, he's in the middle of what he's rightly calling the \"most important\" offseason of his life, rebuilding his body again, preparing to launch into what he hopes will be, if all goes well, his final chapter as an elite-level player. It's not hysterical to wonder about the end -- we may be watching it. And if we are, then what has Joel Embiid been?</p><p>He's been misunderstood. He's not blameless in that. He's been dominant, and then hobbled or absent. He's been resented for that.</p><p>Even his most painful grief has been thrown in his face. At the start of Embiid's rookie season in 2014, his 13-year-old brother Arthur was hit by a truck and killed. The day Arthur died, Embiid ignored a series of phone calls. When he finally answered, it was terrible news.</p><p>Even now, phone calls can send a tremor through him, a quicksilver slice of panic -- someone is dead. In fact, he rarely answers texts or calls. His notifications are turned off.</p><p>Those who need to reach him do so through his assistant or his wife. His replies can take months.</p><p>\"I have a reputation of being not a good texter,\" Embiid tells me, adding that he probably has 10,000 unread messages.</p><p>\"You're kidding,\" I say.</p><p>He reaches for his phone, taps the screen and leans forward to show me. More than 9,500 unread texts and 875 missed calls. Some of the messages are years old.</p><p>\"I just can't do it,\" he says, sitting back.</p><p>I ask who this annoys most in his life.</p><p>\"Everybody,\" he says.</p><hr><p><b>EMBIID'S GETTING COMFORTABLE</b>, stretching his legs. I ask him why some people who adore him have jokingly called him an a--hole.</p><p>\"I like to troll a lot,\" he says. \"I wouldn't say I'm an a--hole.\"</p><p>He thinks on it for a second, then concedes, \"At times, I can be an a--hole.\"</p><p>I first met Embiid in Chicago late last year, after he returned from a seven-game absence due to left knee issues. Loose, jovial talk filled the visitors' locker room at United Center, an air of celebration. Sixers veteran guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3012/kyle-lowry\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle Lowry</a> ordered four trays of wings from Chicago's famous Harold's Chicken.</p><p>After a cold start against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\" target=\"_blank\">Bulls</a>, Embiid looked like himself in an eight-point victory. Lithe and destructive, a one-man revolution of hybrid plays who has layered skill on skill for years. Watch him think his way around the court, moving, as he did that afternoon, between low-post bully to mid-post spinning fadeaway artist to metronomic rise-up shooter at the elbows and nail. See the film study, the drills, the painstaking work. This is talent working on itself, shaping and reshaping.</p><p>He outscored the Bulls by himself in the second quarter.</p><p>His offense was a sideshow compared to what he did to then-Bulls guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine\" target=\"_blank\">Zach LaVine</a> late in the second. LaVine attacked Embiid downhill off a screen, swerving left and wrong-footing Embiid. What happened next happened very slowly and very fast all at once. Embiid whirled, turning his back to LaVine for a moment. Against 99% of the NBA, LaVine wins the duel from this position. But Embiid came out of his twirl between LaVine and the rim. They jumped together, Embiid's momentum carrying him backward, a high hand turning what looked like a LaVine dunk into a contested miss.</p><p>No coach in the world would teach that. No drill can prepare you for it. At Embiid's best, there's no one to compare him to.

It was early December, and there was still enough time to hope.</p><p>Embiid eyed the Harold's Chicken spread, plucked a wing and walked to his locker. After a wait, he fronted the media scrum.</p><p>I asked him how he found a rhythm after starting 0-for-7 from the field. Postgame white noise.</p><p>\"I just got lucky and started making shots,\" Embiid said.</p><p>Refusing to smarten up, I asked, \"Does it really feel like luck?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, it is luck.\"</p><p>I stood directly in front of him. His expression was frozen in an affectation of boredom. He held that for a tense second before a smile started to play at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>Everyone cracked up.</p><p>This is a perquisite Joel Embiid experience, one where he decides how full of it you are by watching as you try to discern how full of it he is.</p><p>During his freshman year at Kansas, Embiid would sometimes pretend his English wasn't good enough to understand what people were saying. He started to tell an exoticizing story in those days, that as a boy in Cameroon, he wandered alone into the jungle and killed a lion as a rite of passage.</p><p>\"People actually believed him,\" his college coach, Bill Self, recalls. \"There was a lot of things that he would do in fun, but I never knew him to be much of a talker as far as expressing true feelings.\"</p><p>The jokes worked as shelters, places to hide himself. Instead of being known, he subsisted on being known as clever.</p><p>Watching him in the locker room in Chicago, I imagined him looking at his college teammates, trying not to smirk at their credulity. A reporter asked how hard he worked to get back for this game.</p><p>\"Trust the process,\" Embiid said, referencing the Sixers' 2013-2016 tanking strategy from which his nickname derives. His smile is gone.</p><p>But stony hostility doesn't suit him. He's sensitive, about to display his wounds. \"I got to give short answers, because when I give long answers, they try to twist my words,\" Embiid said, turning to a couple of teammates.</p><p>\"Good answer! Good answer!\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4431678/tyrese-maxey\" target=\"_blank\">Tyrese Maxey</a> called out from his locker.</p><p>We stood in the aftermath of a galling media cycle. It started in late October when a Philadelphia Inquirer writer mentioned Embiid's son and his late brother in a column chastising Embiid's lack of professionalism and inability to stay in shape. The column implied there was a gap between Embiid's conduct and his public statements about playing to honor his brother's memory.</p><p>\"I've done way too much for this city, putting myself at risk,\" Embiid responded days later. \"I've done way too much for this f---ing city to be treated like this.\"</p><p>When the columnist showed up in the locker room the next day, the two men came face to face. \"The next time you bring up my dead brother and my son again, you are going to see what I'm going to do to you,\" Embiid said. The altercation ended when Embiid shoved the columnist and Sixers staff stepped in between them. The NBA suspended Embiid three games without pay.</p><p>Months later, the column still gnaws at him.</p><p>\"I don't care if the NBA wants to fine me $1 million, $2 million, $5 million, $10 million, I would still do it,\" Embiid says. \"If he walked up to me just like he did, I would push him away again.\"</p><p>Embiid hasn't stopped blaming himself for leaving his brother in Cameroon to play basketball in 2011. Francois Nyam, one of his agents in 2014, called Embiid the night Arthur died. He says the first thing Embiid managed to say after sobbing was, \"That's my fault. I'm a piece of s---.\"</p><p>Embiid's family had planned to be together on draft night in 2014, but after Embiid's first foot surgery, doctors told him not to fly. He remained in Los Angeles at his agent's home while Arthur stayed with family friends on the East Coast before returning to Cameroon. The accident happened nearly four months later. The brothers hadn't seen each other in three years.</p><p>\"It's never going to change,\" Embiid says, all but whispering. \"I still feel it.\"</p><hr><p><b>WEEKS AFTER</b> the locker room altercation in November, the Sixers held a closed-door meeting to address the team's calamitous 2-11 start.</p><p>Details of the meeting leaked the following day. Maxey, who Embiid considers one of his best friends, confronted Embiid about being late for team events and dragging the morale of the group down.</p><p>Embiid told a reporter, \"Whoever leaked that is a real piece of s---.\" He reportedly vowed to find the source.</p><p>\"I know who leaked it,\" Embiid tells me during a late-night phone call after the season ends.</p><p>\"You do?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but I'm not going to -- the past is the past,\" Embiid says. \"The one thing I'll say is, it's hard being around people that do those sorts of stuff.</p><p>\"That goes back to the trust thing. Once you cross that -- you can't expect me to be part of a team meeting again. That's just not going to happen.\"</p><p>\"The way you're talking, it sounds like this person is still around,\" I say.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" he says.</p><p>\"Come on, Joel, you know who's on your team right now,\" I say, laughing.</p><p>\"Free agency just started,\" he says. \"I don't know what's going on.\"</p><p>\"So there's a chance this person may not be around next season,\" I say.</p><p>\"No,\" he says. \"There's a chance they're still around.\"</p><hr><p><b>TAKE A SENTIMENTAL</b> journey: A young Joel Embiid watches Kobe Bryant win his fourth championship in 2009 and falls in love with basketball. He starts playing seriously at 16. In July 2011, he is discovered at a camp in Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital and Embiid's hometown. He leaves his family behind and moves to the U.S. as a raw but gifted prospect two months later. He improves at a miraculous rate, is recruited by several elite programs and ends up at Kansas after witnessing Late Night in the Phog in Lawrence. He is the No. 3 pick in the 2014 NBA draft. You know the rest.</p><p>It's a fairy-tale, one that obscures a period of profound rupture for Embiid. He was first shepherded by then-NBA player and fellow Cameroonian <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3451/luc-mbah-a-moute\">Luc Mbah a Moute</a> and Nyam to Montverde Academy, a prep school west of Orlando, Florida. After struggling for playing time his first year, Embiid was relocated again, this time to The Rock School in Gainesville, Florida.</p><p>With the help of his new coach at The Rock, Embiid moved in with a host family. Marcy Hansen's first thought when she saw 18-year-old Joel Embiid was that there was no way he would be able to sleep on her daughter's recently vacated twin mattress.</p><p>He was nearing 7 feet tall. His accent was thick, his English halting. If someone asked him what city he lived in, the best he could come up with was \"Florida.\" Hansen noticed quickly that he was struggling. He would lie to his parents on the phone, insisting he was well, then sink into a morose silence.</p><p>There has always been something lonely in Embiid, something he can't quite explain. One of his most vivid childhood memories is of visiting France on a family vacation around the age of 12. But while everyone left to go sightseeing, Joel stubbornly holed up in his aunt's apartment, playing video games. His parents left him out of subsequent family trips to France, bringing just his two siblings.</p><p>\"From then, it never really changed,\" he says.</p><p>Hansen was desperate to cheer him up and connect with him. She made him chocolate chip cookies and brought him Chinese takeout for lunch. She hoped her son would bond with him over basketball, but Joel was too closed off.</p><p>\"It felt weird for me,\" Embiid remembers. \"I got there, one of the first things that I saw was guns.\"</p><p>Hansen's husband, Ric, is a veteran and avid hunter. Embiid's father, Thomas, was an officer in Cameroon's military, but Embiid didn't know people lived with so many guns in their homes.</p><p>\"I don't think anybody understands my point of view,\" Embiid tells me. \"Why I was reserved and why I liked to be in my room, why I tried to lock the door...I was kind of scared.</p><p>Basketball was little consolation. Embiid hardly bonded with teammates; they noticed the distance and left him alone. He told his coach he had preferred the dorms at Montverde, where he roomed with another international student who also spoke very little English.</p><p>\"He was thrown into a totally different world and then thrown into another world, within a year,\" Hansen says. \"He probably didn't let us in as much as I would have liked.\"</p><p>Eventually, Ric approached Embiid's coach, and they arranged for Joel to move in with one of the team's assistant coaches.</p><p>Memories of Embiid from this period are often bright and vivid and totally superficial: He was in the room, he was friendly, tall, he ate something sweet, he didn't seem to be paying attention until he would supply a sharp quip, surprising people. He is beloved, missed, cheered from afar.</p><p>Nothing was above Embiid's suspicion, not even evaluations of his talent. \"He didn't know that he was going to be a D-1 player, which is kind of crazy to me,\" says Freddy Bitondo, a friend and former Rock teammate. \"He would tell me stuff, like, 'If basketball don't work, I'll just go to a school for four years and find a job.' And I'm looking at him, like, 'Yo, you're killing us in practice, what are you talking about, bro?'\"</p><p>When he arrived at Kansas, Embiid was convinced he would redshirt as a freshman and spend five years in school. \"You're going to be the best guy I've ever had,\" Self told Embiid.</p><p>By the end of his freshman season in spring 2014, Embiid was a projected No. 1 pick. He went to Self and confessed he didn't feel ready. He didn't know how to eat healthy. He didn't even know how to drive.</p><p>\"I actually decided to stay,\" he says. \"In my head, I was like, 'I don't deserve this. I only averaged 11 points.' I didn't know much about basketball. I didn't understand how the whole system worked.\"</p><p>But those closest to him -- his father, Mbah a Moute and Nyam -- told Embiid it was time to go. He packed his bags and moved to his agent's mansion in Los Angeles.</p><p>While there, recovering after his first navicular bone surgery, Embiid remembers returning late one night and realizing he didn't know the security code to get back inside. So, he did what any teenager might do: He jumped the fence, his surgically repaired right foot still in a cast, and set off the intruder alarm.</p><p>He was, at the time, less than three years removed from the JV team at Montverde, where he once caught an outlet pass alone under the basket, only to leap cluelessly in the air, past the backboard and out of bounds. His life was being accelerated at a speed he could not comprehend, propelled by a story about himself he did not believe, supplied by people he did not trust.</p><p>\"I never knew how good I was,\" Embiid says. \"What are these people talking about? What am I going to do about it? Am I going to believe what they say?\"</p><hr><p><b>THE MOMENT</b> Adam Silver announced Embiid as the No. 3 pick in the 2014 NBA draft, ESPN's feed cut to Embiid staring blankly into the camera.</p><p>\"He seems confused,\" former ESPN columnist Bill Simmons said on the broadcast. \"Get Joel some coffee.\"</p><p>Embiid later explained that the tape was delayed, and the broadcast eventually played his actual reaction -- he pumped his fists and smiled. But in some ways, he's never fully caught up to that delay.</p><p>Embiid and the 76ers waited two years for his foot to heal. Reports at the time claimed that he hadn't been taking his rehab and nutrition seriously. His third year in the league (but first on the court) was cut short by a meniscus tear in the same left knee that troubles him now. A couple of weeks after the 76ers shut him down that season, he jumped on stage at a Meek Mill show, ripped off his shirt and danced to the sound of cheers. The 76ers president of basketball operations at the time, Bryan Colangelo, scolded Embiid publicly. Embiid had \"crossed a line, perception-wise,\" Colangelo said.</p><p>The following season, 2017-18, he was recorded eating a burger courtside while having his foot rubbed by a trainer before a game. An early iteration of the Embiid discourse emerged: <i>Joel's lazy. He doesn't care.</i></p><hr><p><b>\"I STILL SEE</b> a lot of people bring it up, talking about the silly stuff I used to do as a kid, just my second, my third year in the league,\" he says. \"I started playing basketball at 16. You would not be in this position by being lazy.</p><p>\"Starting so much later than everybody else, having to learn the game at the rapid rate that I did, coming to a new country, not knowing the language, learning a different culture, adjusting, being by yourself, that would not happen if you weren't focused.\"</p><p>I ask him in what ways he is responsible for being misunderstood.</p><p>\"Go through all the media narratives,\" Embiid says. \"I haven't been paying attention. So, I don't know what's happened.\"</p><p>He's kidding, of course. I'm expecting him to smile any second now.</p><p>But he doesn't. Instead, he repeats himself, his voice more urgent: \"Go through the narratives.\"</p><p><i>Joel makes excuses.</i></p><p>\"It's not making excuses. When you're hurt every year and everybody knows it, it's the truth,\" he says. \"Now, do you believe, if he was 100 percent does he have what it takes to have a chance at winning? I think a lot of people believe that because I've shown it in the regular season when I was healthy.\"</p><p>Now, he's the one leaning forward.</p><p>\"What if I did this and I was like, 'You know what? I'm just going to chill all season and coast and average 25? Or 20.' And in the playoffs, I go average 30. Would that make me look great? Probably. If I went from averaging 23 to 30 -- A playoff riser. Oh, my God. Joel Jordan. Whatever.</p><p>\"The Brooklyn series two years ago is a perfect example. Double me everywhere. Half court, as soon as I had the ball, that coach was like, 'Go get it.' And guess what? I was fine with it because we kicked the ball out, we made shots, and we won. But guess what it did? It lowered the stats.</p><p>\"So, if that's the narrative that's out there, I'm OK with that because I know what I'm going through and I know what's going on. And no one is in my body to understand what I'm going through.\"</p><p>\"What other narratives?\" he asks.</p><p><i>Joel cares too much about individual awards.</i></p><p>\"If you are in a position to win an MVP, I don't care who you are, you're going after it because I never believed I would be in this position, first of all. Second of all, when I got in the league I thought, 'Yeah, maybe I'll have a chance to be a great defensive player.' I never thought I was going to be this good offensively.\"</p><p>His thoughts drift back to the playoffs, irritated: \"You're basically saying that he's playing harder in the regular season than he's playing in the playoffs, which doesn't make sense because if you look at the minutes, the minutes rise. And you're playing harder. And you do more on both ends of the floor.\"</p><p>He takes a detour into his postseason plus/minus numbers, which measure up with the greats of the game, then chides himself for sounding like his trainer and confidante, Drew Hanlen, who 13 minutes into a phone call sent me a link to Embiid's playoff stats.</p><p>\"You want one more?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Yeah, I want it,\" he says.</p><p><i>Joel is talented but doesn't have the extra intangible stuff it takes to lead.</i></p><p>\"No one is a winner until they've done it. I'm fine with that narrative because I haven't done it. Charles Barkley, great player, right? But he never won. [Allen Iverson] never won. ... But that doesn't mean they weren't great. They were amazing.</p><p>\"Everybody leads in his own way. I lead on the court,\" Embiid continues. \"Over the years, you also grow, and you learn a lot. If you ask my teammates now, they'll tell you a way different story than my teammates a couple years ago, because years ago, I was nowhere to be found.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I ask.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" he says, briefly leaving the battle against his critics to look inward. \"I think it goes back to how I was raised. I don't want to say, lonely but I came to the states, I was alone. I always taught myself to not trust anybody.\"</p><hr><p><b>BY THE SUMMER</b> of 2014, the 76ers were a year into then GM Sam Hinkie's \"Process.\" At that point, all Hinkie had produced was an injured big man (Nerlens Noel) and a flawed, soon-to-be-traded Rookie of the Year (Michael Carter-Williams) who couldn't shoot.</p><p>Embiid arrived in Philadelphia that fall and had already been declared out for the entire 2014-15 season after surgery on the navicular bone of his right foot. He was 20 years old, cast as a Redeemer, and a cloud of uncertainty hung over him and the team.</p><p>Deflecting the pressure, he instead played the part of the cutup. He loved social media banter, fronting a one-sided Twitter romance with Rihanna and taking a ride with VICE Sports where he sarcastically played up stories that he drank Shirley Temples by the pitcher.</p><p>His former coaches in Florida and Kansas barely recognized him. \"I didn't know that he had the ability, or wanted to have the ability, to have all eyes on him,\" Self says. \"In my mind, I'm thinking, 'Jo, what are you doing? Would you just keep your mouth shut? Stay off of social media.'\"</p><p>Behind the scenes, Embiid was in crisis. He was crushed under the grief of his brother's death, living alone at the Ritz-Carlton in downtown Philadelphia, like he didn't expect to be around for long. He played video games, ate poorly and hardly slept. His foot wasn't healing. He couldn't play basketball. Rumors spread that his weight rose to nearly 300 pounds. He contemplated quitting.</p><p>\"He was hanging on by a thread,\" one friend says.</p><p>His relationship with the 76ers unraveled. Embiid believed something was wrong with his injury, but the team brushed it off as laziness, several sources told me. Frustrated, he quit showing up to rehab and training and stopped communicating with the team.</p><p>\"I had to start being an a--hole,\" Embiid says. \"Whatever they asked me to do, I was, like, 'I'm not doing it.'\"</p><p>The 76ers, unsure what to do, responded by repeatedly fining him. Embiid tells me he stopped keeping track of how much he was fined that year after the amount reached $300,000. \"It's worth it,\" Embiid remembers thinking. \"They're not listening to me and I'm not going to keep putting my body at risk.\"</p><p>Hinkie, meanwhile, raced to modernize the 76ers' health and performance operation with Embiid in mind. At the start of Embiid's tenure with the 76ers, his rehab had been overseen by an intern.</p><p>Hinkie hired David Martin, who had been working at the Australian Institute of Sport for 21 years. For the next year, Martin fielded monthly email questions -- the most rigorous professional test of his career. One question stood out: <i>How would you build a team and treatment plan for a 7-footer with a navicular bone injury?</i></p><p>In one of their first meetings, Hinkie drew a square and then another square inside that one that took up about 90% of the first one's area. The first square was the totality of Martin's time. The second was time spent getting Embiid healthy.</p><p>Hinkie emphasized that Embiid's combination of size, skill and talent was extremely rare. Martin had worked with special forces units and a Tour de France champion, but as he listened to Hinkie, Martin thought he had found the culmination of his career.</p><p>In June 2015, Hinkie and Martin flew to LA to meet with Embiid and Dr. Richard Ferkel, who had operated on Embiid's foot a year before. The news was bad. Embiid's foot had not healed. Embiid sat quietly. Martin was the stranger in the room. He felt Embiid watching him.</p><p>\"He has a real piercing gaze,\" Martin says. \"You can just see him looking at you in a way. Like, 'Don't feed me any BS.'\"</p><p>Embiid remembers feeling disappointed but also vindicated. He was right, and his critics within the organization were wrong. Something had been wrong with his foot. He wasn't imagining pain or making excuses. This was a difficult lesson to unlearn; it is easy to become a prisoner of one's own victories.</p><p>A nebulous and contradictory <i>they</i> began to form in Embiid's mind: the coaches, front office executives and medical staff who had \"cast him out,\" as one friend puts it. They wanted to save their jobs, he thought. They wanted him to play hurt -- to prove themselves right for drafting him, to prove themselves right for not wanting to draft him, to sell tickets, to show that he didn't sell tickets. <i>They </i>would be just as happy if his career lasted 18 months or 18 years.</p><p>Loyalty became overwhelmingly important to him, and his search for it, his willingness to test it in others, became a way he forged a path within the organization. He remained in a protective bubble, amassing and shedding adherents.</p><p>Martin, eager to prove that he could be trusted not to abandon the young star, often stayed in Philadelphia with Embiid instead of traveling with the team. One day, he noticed a mess of $20 bills on a table in Embiid's apartment. Martin suggested Embiid put the money away; traffic through Embiid's apartment was frequent -- nutritionists, trainers, housekeeping staff.</p><p>No, Embiid said, if anyone took anything, he would know.</p><p>\"Are you planting this?\" Martin asked. \"Are you trying to see if anyone will steal from you?\"</p><p>Embiid didn't say anything.</p><p>\"Maybe you're checking me out,\" Martin said. \"Maybe you want to know if I would take your money.\"</p><p>They both laughed.</p><p>\"I don't necessarily do it <i>to</i> people,\" Embiid tells me. \"I'm just going to leave it, and if something is missing, I'm going to know exactly who took it.</p><p>\"Because that's happened, I've had money or other things that have gone missing,\" he says.</p><p>\"When it did happen, I didn't need to confront anybody. That was just, like, 'OK, all right. I got what I needed.' Now, I know not to talk to these people and never trust them.\"</p><hr><p><b>AFTER EMBIID'S SECOND</b> surgery in the summer of 2015, Martin assembled a small, protective core of advocates.</p><p>Kim Caspare, an experienced physical therapist, quickly became a key member of the group. What others mistook for laziness in Embiid, she saw fear --  this was a young man who didn't trust his body, the advice he was getting, or the intentions of those giving it. Embiid needed \"a family around him,\" Caspare remembers thinking. \"'I've got to just take care of this guy, because this guy is hurting.'\"</p><p>Caspare began as a consultant but became such a steadying force for Embiid that the Sixers hired her full-time in 2019 as a physical therapist. Her initial stint was supposed to last four weeks, but she went on to work with Embiid for nine years.</p><p>By the time he met Caspare, Embiid's reputation for flaking was well-established. But Caspare says that was never a problem between them. \"Never once did Joel not show up when we said we were going to,\" she says. \"But I've seen over [nine] years that he didn't show up for many people.\"</p><p>Embiid did not bend to the traditional command structure of NBA teams. \"It's the NBA. People are wrong and strong all the time,\" Martin says. \"They say it loud and say it with authority and expect people to listen to them -- and Joel's not easily manipulated.\"</p><p>Embiid's reputation within the organization was toxic. Everyone was talking: training staff, coaches, massage therapists, reporters, even interns whose main activity was snagging rebounds.</p><p>\"People whisper in hallways,\" Martin says.</p><p>Embiid was an enigmatic giant, his face shrouded in a hoodie, shuffling slowly and wordlessly, appearing and disappearing, it seemed, on his whim. \"He just wouldn't talk to anybody on the team,\" one person familiar with the situation says. \"Literally completely silent.\"</p><p>Things got so bad that Martin drew up a confidential survey for members of the performance department. They were asked to answer multiple-choice questions about several players, including Embiid: <i>Do you think this guy will ever be an MVP? An All-Star? A starter on a championship team? A rotation player? Do you think he'll end up in Europe?</i></p><p>The results were dismaying. \"Nobody believed in Joel,\" Martin tells me. \"They just weren't into him.\" Martin was convinced Embiid would never be able to heal in an environment that was so hostile. He decided to go to Hinkie and owner Josh Harris and ask to take Embiid out of the country, to Aspetar, an orthopedic and sports medicine hospital in Doha, Qatar. After some resistance, the team relented.</p><p>Desperate to make the trip count, Martin scheduled a series of appointments with experts. Embiid often missed those meetings. When Martin asked him what was wrong, Embiid explained he wanted to stay on an NBA schedule. Games are played in the evening; players go to bed late and wake up late. That made sense to Martin -- one of the goals of the visit was to improve Embiid's sleep. When he switched the consultations to the afternoon, Embiid's absences and tardiness stopped. Embiid liked Aspetar so much that the team sent him twice, once in February 2016 and again for a two-week stint at the end of March that year.</p><p>A pattern had emerged. Those loyal to Embiid and invested in his future became an organization within the 76ers organization. Embiid's allies saw him as wounded and gifted and alone and in need of reinforcing. Martin, trying to understand how to work with Embiid and explain his behavior, started reading in-depth about working with gifted children. They flattered his proclivities (he did not communicate so they became his go-betweens, covering for his tardiness) to get the most they could out of him, if not always the best.</p><p>\"I probably should've just been like, 'Get your ass up off the table and get on the floor,'\" Caspare says. \"But I didn't do that because he would've maybe gotten off the table and walked into the locker room and done nothing. So I couldn't risk that.\"</p><p>I asked Martin if he feels now that he might have coddled Embiid during this critical early period of his career.</p><p>\"Joel is really unique,\" Martin says. \"When you sit with him for a bit, it feels like you don't need to play by all the rules. There's a lot of weird rules in the NBA, and there's a lot of things that are culturally expected in the NBA, and they're really designed to make owners feel comfortable, and general managers feel powerful, and coaches feel intelligent, and support staff feel respected.\"</p><p>\"I don't know if I'm being perceptive,\" Martin continues. \"Or if I'm creating an elaborate justification for him.\"</p><p>Years later, it's difficult for those who surrounded and supported Embiid to parse between damaging him with indulgence and saving his career.</p><p>\"If you really went back to the past, and you were there in those moments, you would know him being in the league, and becoming an MVP is a miracle,\" one member of Embiid's circle says. \"There are top coaches, there are top league executives who did not believe he would step foot on the court again.\"</p><hr><p><b>I SAT WITH</b> 76ers head coach Nick Nurse and president of basketball operations Daryl Morey in a sunny conference room at the team's practice facility in Camden, New Jersey. It was a late morning in early April, and players trickled in for practice.</p><p>There were only five games left in the season. The Sixers would lose four of them, finishing 24-58, their worst record since 2015-16, the year before Embiid's debut.</p><p>Both men have had run-ins with the Sixers fans and media throughout the 2024-25 season. At MIT's Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in March, Morey caused a stir when he said he used AI modeling to help make personnel decisions and angered fans further when he said, \"Anger is all that drives Sixers fans as far as I can tell.\"</p><p>For Nurse, it was the aggravation of spending the season as a mix between surgeon general and press secretary, a role he was clearly fed up with. \"I'm up there answering medical questions all the time,\" Nurse tells me, his hands gesticulating. \"'Hey, [Embiid's] getting this thing on Tuesday. We'll have more information on Wednesday.' Well, something happens on Tuesday, and this MRI doesn't happen, and now it's Wednesday, and they're like, 'You said you were going to give us an update today. Why didn't you?' Well, the timeline has changed. That's the timeline I had two days ago, but now it's changed.</p><p>\"Don't be mad at me, I'm just telling you what's happening.\"</p><p>The confusion about when Embiid would play became an ongoing storyline, causing frequent tension between fans, reporters and the organization. In late November, an unexpected Embiid absence turned the Wells Fargo Center into a mass game of Clue. Embiid was scheduled to warm up and then decide about playing, but he never did. One reporter said he wasn't even in the arena. Another said they spotted his knee brace in front of his locker. Another said they saw a cellphone on his usual chair but couldn't confirm if the phone was Embiid's.</p><p>\"He's insanely private,\" one Sixers staffer told me that night.</p><p>But not inscrutable. Nurse and Morey only had to look.</p><p>His pregame warmups were little operas. Every miss in his routine aggravated him. Missed and looked up at the sky, raised his arms and asked, why? Missed and rolled his eyes in contempt. Missed and shook his head in exasperation. Missed and bent over to clutch his sweats at the knee, hands balled in tight fists.</p><p>There was more, a repertoire of Embiidian gesture and expression: There's the head clutch that means he's irritated with himself or a teammate but can also mean it's so stupid and ridiculous how good I am. There's the one he does when a shot comes off his fingers wrong but goes in anyway, where he tilts his head and does that thing with his mouth that signals he's having a little mock think. A little jut of the lower lip, the \"could be worse\" face. There's the one where he shoots his arms out from his hips like he's about to flash finger pistols and say let me see your hands. Instead, his fists stay balled, and he swears at himself, viciously or rapturously.</p><p>He was waiting for things to go wrong, and they did. He somehow tripped and fell on two separate occasions during warmups. First in Chicago, where no one seemed to notice, and then again on Christmas Day against <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2ca761df-5f60-b2e9-22ed-e099c46d889b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics\">Boston</a>, where the clip went viral.</p><p>When he got to his feet and slid off the black protective mask he had been wearing (weeks before he'd suffered the fifth major facial injury of his career, dating to his Florida AAU team), his face was a particularly Embiidian blend of expressions: He was pissed. Over it -- I mean truly, deeply sick of it all. He couldn't believe it, and then, wait, of course he could. He stared at the ground, shaking his head at it like even the parquet court was out to betray him.</p><p>He turned Christmas afternoon into a spectacle of exuberant spite. He hates Boston, and Boston hates him. Where better?</p><p>He Eurostepped past <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3917376/jaylen-brown\" target=\"_blank\">Jaylen Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066354/payton-pritchard\" target=\"_blank\">Payton Pritchard</a> for an and-1 and did the DX chop. He drained a 3 right before halftime and swung his arms into an up yours gesture that made the crowd shriek its loathing. He stood near center court yapping at fans, placing his hand over his heart, waving goodbye. He made two late free throws to seal it and walked backward with a diabolical grin on his face.</p><p>His moods descend on him and become the weather of a whole game, a whole team, a whole season.</p><hr><p><b>\"I THINK PEOPLE FORGET</b> he had a real injury at <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\" target=\"_blank\">Golden State</a>,\" Nurse says. \"But leading up to that point, he was playing the best basketball of his life.\"</p><p>It was some of the best basketball we have ever seen.</p><p>The Sixers were 26-7 with Embiid in the lineup before he injured his left knee at Golden State in January 2024. He was averaging 35.3 points in 34 minutes, outpacing Wilt Chamberlain's 1961-62 season and on his way to becoming only the second player in history to score more than a point a minute. He scored at least 30 in 22 consecutive games, the fifth-longest 30-point stretch in NBA history. He tallied 16 straight games with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds, tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the second longest such streak.</p><p>In December 2023, the Sixers went 8-1 with Embiid on the floor. He averaged 40.2 points and 12.6 rebounds at a comical 60.6% shooting rate.</p><p>There were statement pieces, too. A 51-point, 12-rebound performance in a late December dismantling of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves\" target=\"_blank\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a>. Then, in January, a breezy 70-point, 18-rebound outburst against the Spurs, the old-fashioned way -- he made one of two 3s.</p><p>Embiid missed the next two months after the Golden State game, recovering from meniscus surgery on his left knee. He returned late in the season to make a playoff push, clearly hobbled. The Sixers won their final eight games and qualified for the play-in tournament, where they beat the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"81e3212c-30ef-9b1b-5edb-453b13ff265a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a> and moved on to a first-round series against the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\" target=\"_blank\">New York Knicks</a>.</p><p>Embiid looked dominant early in Game 1, starting 4-of-5. In the second quarter, he pump-faked, then stepped through and chucked the ball off the backboard, leaping past <a data-player-guid=\"0f21507b-ed4f-c040-eefc-8223b67fab5b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4351852/mitchell-robinson\">Mitchell Robinson</a> to dunk the ball over <a data-player-guid=\"31ec117d-6e14-d4f0-9414-9d2467197179\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3934719/og-anunoby\">OG Anunoby</a>. It was an incredible, audacious move, an all-time playoff highlight until he landed and his left knee wobbled and he collapsed to the floor.</p><p>As he lay on his back, an overhead camera showed him with his hands clasped on top of his head, the left side of his face frozen. He made an improbable return in the second half of Game 1, though the 76ers lost. And after a controversial loss in the final seconds of Game 2, Embiid conducted his postgame interview at his locker with his head bowed and his hand over his brow, trying to hide his facial paralysis.</p><p>He was defiant, bristling as one reporter asked him a question in French. \"I'm not talking in French,\" Embiid said, cutting the reporter off. He promised the 76ers would win the series.</p><p>But the pressure of his rushed return from injury was starting to tell. He had been diagnosed with Bell's palsy days before the series started, after he began suffering migraines. He was short of fitness because of the injury, visibly limping, worried about the integrity of his grotesquely swollen knee, enduring nearly round-the-clock treatment and forced to play heavy minutes in the most critical games of the season. His vision was blurry, and his head ached. He was hardly sleeping because his left eye wouldn't close.</p><p>Caspare began running Embiid through a battery of exercises to help him reorient himself in space, to move his whole head to scan his surroundings because his eye couldn't move in the way he was used to.</p><p>\"I was sitting next to him in the locker room,\" his former teammate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3416/nicolas-batum\" target=\"_blank\">Nicolas Batum</a> told me. \"I saw his knee before every game, after every game.\"</p><p>Batum shook his head. \"I saw his knee,\" he said again. \"I have no idea how he could even walk.\"</p><p>Embiid doesn't know how he managed to keep playing. Hanlen would ask him after every game if he was going to keep going. \"I was like, 'No. There is no chance,'\" Embiid says.</p><p>Hardly anyone knew how bad it was. Information about him is at a premium in the best of times; in a crisis, he closes himself off. Embiid was \"alone in his agony,\" Caspare says. \"People don't really know what's what. They think it's his knee. But it's not his knee. It's his knee, it's his eye, it's his whole system.\"</p><p>In the middle of late-night treatment sessions, Embiid would look at Caspare, his eyes drained. \"I don't know if I can do it again,\" he would say. \"I can't do another minute.\" But then he'd talk himself back up, \"OK, I'm going to do another minute.\"</p><p>Embiid cycled through a wheel of emotions: deflated, worried about his long-term health, overwhelmed by pain, desperate to play, desperate to be saved from himself, afraid of letting the team and the fans down, wary of letting anyone know what condition he was in.</p><p>On the morning of April 25, the day of Game 3, Caspare left Embiid's house after another late-night treatment session. She had seen enough. She sent Embiid a long text at 2:29 a.m.</p><p>It reads, in part: \"Do you have the ability to give yourself some grace and compassion? I'm here to remind you that you are deserving of that. Who cares about what people think about your eye? You are allowed to fail. You're allowed to lose. But you are not allowed to feel shame or feel hopeless. There is no place for such emotions. You have fought. It has been a courageous fight.\"</p><p>She tried to give him an out, worrying his efforts had reached \"crushing proportions.\" She urged him to play under a hard minutes restriction, even though it was the playoffs: \"Maybe we discuss it with the team. Joel wants to go out there and give everything he has, but the team has to put a hard minute restriction on you, limit you to 25 minutes.\"</p><p>Regardless of his decision, she promised: \"You can do anything. And I am with you no matter what.\"</p><p>She didn't hear from him that morning or afternoon. He showed up at her treatment table in the arena at his usual time. She started getting him ready. She handed him her phone.</p><p>\"Did you read this?\" Caspare asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Embiid said.</p><p>They shared a look -- he was going to play. Embiid scored 50 points that night in a must-win Game 3, a playoff career high.</p><p>The Sixers lost the series in six games. Embiid averaged 33 points, 10.8 rebounds and 5.7 assists. He had nothing left late in games when the adrenaline wore off and the pain took hold. \"I knew I only had about two quarters,\" he says. \"My body just was, like, 'Nope, that's it.' There was nothing I could do. I shot probably, like, 10 percent in the fourth quarter.\"</p><p>Embiid looks back at the series with ambivalence. \"In those situations, you wish some of the people upstairs kind of had your back and were like, this is not OK,\" he says. \"You're not playing.\"</p><p>\"I've had to stop Joel a couple of times,\" says Martin, who left the team in 2019. \"When he gets into competition mode, it's really difficult to have a meaningful conversation. ... And that was before he was super famous.\"</p><p>Embiid worries that too often, he's made the wrong call, allowed himself to be coaxed back to the court too soon, pushed himself because of what type of player and person he wanted to be, taxing his body and leaving him vulnerable to repeat injuries. This is one of the feelings he's been trying to unpack in therapy.</p><p>\"It's basically damned if you do, damned if you don't. Because if you don't play, then, you know, there's this whole narrative. ... I never cared about the 'soft' comments,\" Embiid tells me on the phone. \"All I cared about was the team and my teammates. I never wanted to feel like I was quitting on them. And obviously, that goes back to the whole thing in therapy about not wanting to disappoint people.\"</p><p>\"Ultimately, I guess I made those decisions. And then you got to live with it.\"</p><p>Weeks before, at his home, when I brought up the Knicks series, he sounded like he had made a different kind of peace with his choices. I asked him if he was going to take steps to protect himself if others wouldn't.</p><p>He looked me in the eye and said, \"We can sit here and I'll tell you I'm changing, but I know myself. I don't think that's going to happen. ... I always want to play.\"</p><hr><p><b>GRANT HILL, THE</b> managing director of USA Basketball, watched Embiid toil through the Knicks-Sixers series from courtside as a broadcaster. He admired that Embiid played injured, even if he thought it wasn't \"the smartest thing.\" Hill had spent a year recruiting Embiid for the Paris Games that would begin later that summer.</p><p>It started with a visit to Embiid's house in the fall of 2022. Embiid had recently become a citizen of France and the United States. His Olympic allegiance was up for grabs. Hill knew that Team USA needed a big who could contend with the size and physicality of the international game. The 1996 USA team Hill played on had featured Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson.</p><p>\"He brought a dimension to our team that we hadn't had in really quite some time,\" Hill says. \"In previous Olympics, you know, we had bigs that were very mobile, bigs that could get out and switch, but weren't necessarily a post presence, with all due respect.\"</p><p>The meeting, which Hill thought might only be 15 minutes, went for nearly two hours and left a strong impression on Embiid. \"He just came to get to know me,\" Embiid says. \"I appreciated that.\"</p><p>Hill was equally impressed. \"He was very thoughtful, very smart, very engaging,\" Hill says. \"There was just a lot of depth. ... I don't know if he's accurately or adequately portrayed.\"</p><p>Embiid gave no indication where he was leaning, and the two men kept in contact for the next 12 months. Hill visited the Sixers in a Boulder, Colorado, hotel on Oct. 4, 2023, sneaking past Sixers beat writers. Reports had surfaced that France wanted an answer from Embiid by Oct. 10. Embiid resented the ultimatum: \"I was like, 'Nope, you're not going to do this to me.'\"</p><p>Hill's phone rang the next morning. Embiid said he was going to play for Team USA. It was Oct. 5, Hill's birthday. \"That was the best birthday present I got that day,\" Hill says.</p><p>When Embiid reported to camp for Team USA in early July, he was \"not at his best,\" Hill says. \"But we were patient ... we knew we needed him.\" He had been working daily with Hanlen and Caspare by his side in the weeks leading up to the camp. By the time Team USA was in France preparing for its first match of the group stage against Serbia, Hill says Embiid \"was the best player on the court.\"</p><p>Embiid was excited to do the little things. He geeked out about setting screens for <a data-player-guid=\"5dda51f1-50c9-66e1-2026-400b73f34fad\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Steph Curry</a>. But he promptly got sick [\"Really sick,\" Caspare says. \"Nobody really knows how sick.\"] in the rain at the opening ceremonies, traveling from Paris to Lille apart from the rest of the team. He played wanly against Serbia in the first game of the round-robin and sat out the next game on orders from team doctors.</p><p>His presence was vital in the medal rounds, though, especially in the semifinal rematch against Serbia. For the first and only time at the Paris Games, Team USA trailed in the fourth quarter before Embiid and Curry led a comeback. Embiid scored seven consecutive points.</p><p>\"We don't beat Serbia without him,\" Hill says. \"Us being patient with him had paid off.\"</p><p>But nothing with Embiid is ever so simple. \"He's pushing his risk of injury in a setting where he's not even gaining anything except riding tails of other all-stars,\" wrote one veteran Philadelphia commentator before the medal rounds had begun.</p><p>Even Embiid's choice to represent Team USA was criticized. On one hand, by those who said Embiid should have tried to qualify with Cameroon, and on the other by members of the French delegation who said Embiid had approached them about playing for France and being fast-tracked to French citizenship for that purpose.</p><p>As the Sixers rolled into their season and Embiid's knee did not respond to the ramp-up, his Olympics moment became tarnished. A new appendix was added to the Embiid discourse: <em>Glory seeking in Paris had cost him his health</em>.</p><p>Embiid and his circle are quick to swat the notion away. \"Compare that to the way I was moving against New York,\" Embiid says. \"No, it did not set me back.\" His responsibilities in Paris were limited, and his playing time was irregular. He says he wasn't 100% but his knee and body felt good.</p><p>\"He was OK to get his contract, and he was OK to win a gold medal,\" Caspare says. \"We were OK.\"</p><hr><p><b>THE 76ERS FALTERED</b> while Embiid missed 17 of last season's first 21 games through injury and league suspension. Injuries to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george\" target=\"_blank\">Paul George</a> and promising rookie <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683778/jared-mccain\" target=\"_blank\">Jared McCain</a> compounded the problem. The public grew hungry for answers. Embiid's old doubts, the sense of spooky doom that accompanied some of his injuries, began to take hold. Postseason after postseason, a broken face, a shattered thumb, an LCL sprain, a hyperextension, meniscus tears, Bell's palsy.</p><p>\"Every single year, you start asking yourself questions like, 'Why?'\" he said to reporters during the Knicks series. He brought it up again in December, saying he struggled not to feel bad about himself.</p><p>And next to his bad luck has always been this: \"He's so big and he's so mobile,\" Caspare says. \"That's two contradictory things when you jump, and land, and load, and push.\" Embiid is large, dense and long and yet he has traits one finds in smaller athletes: rhythm, coordination, scary fluidity. Martin compares Embiid to a semi-truck maneuvering like a Ferrari. \"That's a lot of inertia,\" he says. \"It only takes a small angulation to be a little bit off and then the joints are going to weather that abuse.\"</p><p>His brilliance sits hand in hand with his risk. We are always witnessing both.</p><p>And on top of his risk was this: He had never quite silenced his own doubts. The questions that had persisted in his mind since his days at The Rock when he baffled teammates with the idea he was going to have a normal job or that led him into Self's office wanting to redshirt and then wanting to stay even when he had emerged as the consensus No. 1 pick -- those are voices only recently subdued.</p><p>Embiid won his first MVP in 2023, but it wasn't until the next season that Hanlen felt Embiid fully stepped into his talent. \"There were so many times where I was, like, 'You're better than you think,'\" Hanlen says. \"Last year [2023-24], was the first year that I thought he had 'f--- it' mode. Where he just knew, like, 'Man, I am good enough to impact the game in whatever way I want to.'\"</p><p>Embiid says before he injured his left knee against Golden State, he was close to what he considers his final form: 35, 12 and 7 rebounds on 50-40-90. \"I'd seen everything. There was nothing you could throw at me that could throw me off,\" he says. \"From me being 16 to 29, and even in those 13 years of playing basketball, I missed about five years' worth of games. ... The way I see it, that was a normal progression for someone that started playing basketball that late.\"</p><p>Last year's injury threatened to undo all this work, not just physically but psychologically. \"I'm telling you that this confidence, the trust, that's a big factor,\" Caspare says. \"He never really believed in himself until very recently and then he got fricking hurt.\"</p><p>Loved ones started to notice just how badly he was struggling. Eventually, it was Jameer Nelson, a friend and former player and now assistant GM of the 76ers, who approached Embiid in September and recommended a therapist Nelson trusted.</p><p>\"I was, like, 'There is no chance. I don't believe in none of that,'\" Embiid says.</p><p>But he trusted Nelson, so he started going -- and he's still going.</p><p>\"To this day, I'm 100 percent committed to it,\" Embiid says. \"But I will not sit here and say that my belief is ever going to be 100 percent in therapy.\"</p><p>The sessions have gifted him a narrative about himself, an explanation he defaults to frequently. \"Feeding into the pressure of you got to play, got to go out there, can't let people down and this and that,\" Embiid tells me. \"That's probably one of the reasons why I'm in this position now.\"</p><p>The uncertainty about his knee reignited old tensions between Embiid and the Sixers' front office.</p><p>After months of uncertainty, false starts and recurrent swelling, Embiid couldn't take it anymore. In February, before a loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks\" target=\"_blank\">Milwaukee Bucks</a>, Embiid told ESPN's Lisa Salters that he would need another surgery, which reportedly surprised the organization. Morey acknowledged that surprise in our meeting.</p><p>\"If you don't want to listen to me, then I have to find something else, to make sure that I'm going to be listened to,\" Embiid tells me. \"When I told Lisa that, I think it was a cry for help. ... It feels like everybody refuses to acknowledge what's actually going on.\"</p><hr><p><b>NICK NURSE LEFT</b> to run practice as Morey and I lingered in the conference room. We spoke about his job, about being in the middle of Embiid's story when so many talk as if we're at the end, about holding a bunch of possible futures in your head at the same time.</p><p>\"That's exactly how I think about it,\" Morey said. \"Very few people get that actually.\"</p><p>But the story wants an ending. So I asked.</p><p>I asked Morey about a possible future where Embiid's knee doesn't heal, a future where he's never an MVP-level player again.</p><p>Morey paused.</p><p>In September, he and 76ers owners bet $192.9 million against that future, a three-year extension that will pay nearly $70 million to Embiid at age 34. They bet George's four-year, nearly $212 contract, too, a deal for a skillful but diminishing player whose value as a premium third option can only be justified if he's the elite supplement to a championship-winning superstar. Embiid is the kind of player you double down on, triple down. You lose your job over him. Disappear. Hinkie did. Hinkie's mentor, Morey, might yet.</p><p>\"I take it back,\" Morey said. \"I don't think...\"</p><p>Morey never finished the sentence. Mulling that future sent a current through his body, and through the entire room. His words came apart in a laughing fit. He laughed, and the 76ers' head of communications, who had been sitting in the room, laughed, and I laughed, and I didn't even know why.</p><p>Morey stood out of his chair and walked to the door. \"I'm going to choose to think of the positive today,\" he said, and walked out.</p><hr><p><b>I VISIT EMBIID AGAIN</b> a week after his surgery in April, enter through the same door, use the same bathroom, slip on the same shoe covers, walk down the same pale hall, sit in the piano room and wait. He's watching baseball on the phone again when he lumbers in, his left knee wrapped in gauze. He's wearing a Team USA T-shirt and Sixers shorts and furry slides. This is his second operation on that knee in 14 months. He's already started rehab.</p><p>He has a cold. His voice is scratchy, even quieter this time. He looks exhausted.</p><p>I tell him what happened with Morey and then ask Embiid the same question.</p><p>He gives me an inscrutable look. \"I'm about to stand up and leave, too,\" he says.</p><p>And it happens all over again. He starts wheeze laughing. A member of his team who has been sitting in the room starts laughing, and I start laughing.</p><p>When it's over, Embiid is coughing, tears in his eyes.</p><p>\"It's going to work out,\" he says after we settle. \"I believe in myself, believe in God. It's all about doing the right things. It's going to pay off. So, there's no question of if it doesn't work out.\"</p><p>I asked them both to look into the abyss, a future of salaries they couldn't live up to, careers they couldn't rescue. They both laughed in my face and said, yeah, right.</p><p>Earlier, I had asked him a broader version of that question. I asked him to imagine a future where he's finished playing basketball, whatever successes and failures the next few years bring.</p><p>He talked about escaping, traveling with his family, enjoying the fruits of his labor. His face was expectant. \"The end looks like y'all would never hear from me again,\" he says. \"I can't wait.\"</p><hr><p><b>THE PIANO ROOM </b>-- occupied by dark oversized ottomans, high curtains, a marble fireplace -- looks ripped from a catalogue. Sometimes Embiid and Arthur sit at the piano to bang some keys, but the only people who play are Embiid's sister or Nurse when one of them comes over.</p><p>But above the couch where Embiid sits hangs a painting, a portrait of Embiid dressed like an aristocrat. At his chest, he holds a Goldendoodle. I laugh when I first see it.</p><p>Embiid tells me he snagged it from the set of a Mountain Dew shoot. A gag gift, hardly worth remarking upon except it's the only thing in the room that looks like a decision made by Embiid.</p><p>The Goldendoodle in the painting is Klaus Hinkie De Paula Embiid. De Paula is Embiid's wife's last name. Hinkie is for Sam, the GM who drafted him and was forced out before Embiid played a single NBA game. Klaus is Embiid's favorite character from \"The Vampire Diaries,\" a TV show he has rewatched maybe 10 times.</p><p>All of this sounds funny until Embiid tells me he rewatches his favorite shows to fall asleep at night.</p><p>And there's no laughter left in it after I learn his dog Klaus died in October 2020 from internal injuries after an elevator closed on him. Like many of Embiid's jokes, the painting contains shards of his pain.</p><p>\"I lost my best friend this morning!\" Embiid posted on Instagram. \"Knowing my background, Dogs in the house was always unheard of and impossible, but having you taught me something different about this world we live in.\"</p><p>\"That was my first dog,\" Embiid later tells me on the phone. \"When you have that, and tragedies like my brother, you don't want to forget. You always want to...\"</p><p>His son, Arthur, who has been floating in and out of the conversation, playing hide and seek, grudgingly leaving to brush his teeth, walks back in, having lost his struggle to avoid being sent to bed.</p><p>\"Can I get 21 hugs?\" Arthur asks.</p><p>I listen to them count out their hugs.</p><p>\"OK, love you,\" Embiid says.</p><p>When Arthur is gone, Embiid continues: \"I don't know how people deal with death. But I always felt like I need stuff to kind of remind me of why I'm doing this. The reason why I'm in this position is because I pushed myself because of what happened to my brother. ... Same thing with the birth of my son.</p><p>\"Sometimes when you just walk by and you look at that, it kind of reminds you. But then again, at times, that also has a negative effect. When I go home to Cameroon like I did last year ... there's a lot of pictures of my little brother all over the house.</p><p>\"You see it, you just start crying.\"</p><hr><p><b>\"I HOPE ONE DAY</b> someone makes a show or, whatever, writes a book about it,\" Embiid says of his time with the Sixers. \"We went from GMs having burner accounts. And then we've had great guys that we drafted, but then again, stuff happened that no one could ever figure it out. The drama, Sam Hinkie being kicked out, bringing in the Colangelos. It's been a lot of things that have happened. And that's what I'm talking about when I'm talking about continuity. It starts at the top.\"</p><p>In so many ways that count, he's at the top. Through three front office regimes, three head coaches, a gallery of failed, too quickly aborted or still emergent costars -- <a data-player-guid=\"c5525079-4a9b-1491-713f-1f48699e89b0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907387/ben-simmons\">Ben Simmons</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler-iii\" target=\"_blank\">Jimmy Butler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\" target=\"_blank\">James Harden</a>, Tyrese Maxey -- Embiid has been the 76ers' continuity, and the ways he has learned to carry or shirk that responsibility have shaped the 76ers in his image.</p><p>Embiid learned the game in a solitary way. He was an autodidact who would watch Hakeem Olajuwon videos and replicate the moves. He blew Self and his Kansas teammates away with the rapid evolution of his skills. One night, before Kansas played New Mexico, Embiid walked into a teammate's room with his laptop open. Look at this move, he said. I'm doing this tomorrow.</p><p>And he did. Embiid caught a botched lob pass on the break, backed down his defender on the low block and left him frozen with a dream shake, finishing with an up-and-under reverse layup. \"Ooh! Ooh!\" Shouted the color commentator. \"Olajuwon!\"</p><p>When Hanlen and Embiid work on something new, Hanlen will demonstrate the move while Embiid circles him, asking questions and narrating what he's seeing. \"Show me again. Show me again. Show me again,\" Embiid says. Then, \"I got it.\"</p><p>But the restless solitude in which he nurtured his talent is no use in leading a team. \"I never wanted to be a vocal leader,\" Embiid tells me. \"The way I was going to lead is my action. When I get on the court, whether it's playing hard, carrying the team, doing whatever I have to do to put us in a position to win, that's how I always saw myself as leading.\"</p><p>His first NBA head coach, Brett Brown, tried to steer Embiid toward the example of another quiet-by-nature big man, Tim Duncan. But Duncan had the organization of the Spurs around him. Embiid had the Process, and all its attendant chaos. And he had a Twitter account, where he put on a persona at odds with who teammates and coaches encountered in private.</p><p>\"You try to find yourself. You don't really know who you are,\" Embiid tells me, exasperated with how the foibles of his youth have clung to him. \"I tried to become a little bit more serious because I felt like that was more me. ... The trolling part, which I still do, I couldn't keep up with it because that just wasn't me.\"</p><p>Embiid's season and a half long stint alongside Harden, with whom he grew close, accelerated Embiid's evolution as a leader. Their bond taught Embiid that closeness off the court translated into on-court success. Maxey has been a particular beneficiary of this change. It was Embiid who steered Hanlen and Maxey together. And last summer, when Maxey signed a new deal with the 76ers, he credited Embiid as the first person to vocally support him. In Sixers camp in October, Embiid was the first to single out the promising rookie McCain.</p><p>Embiid speaks of Harden with deep affection. He thinks the 76ers gave up too quickly on that iteration of the team. What was required after their Game 7 collapse against Boston in 2023 was tinkering in the margins, not another restart.</p><p>\"I kept going back to it, the continuity,\" Embiid says. \"When you feel like you have something, instead of building up on it, you just start over. And that's been like that every single year.\"</p><hr><p><b>LACK OF CONTINUITY</b> is more than just an organizational gripe for Embiid, it has been a feature of his life since he committed himself to basketball as a teenager. And with the 76ers, the departures are partly of his own making.</p><p>He refuses to exert himself over personnel decisions, only to later complain about them. The exit of Jimmy Butler is the most obvious example. His reasons for this are rooted in his own personal history.</p><p>He wonders what would have happened to him if the 76ers had an established star with the clout to ship him out early in his career.</p><p>\"I always told myself I will never be responsible for someone losing their job, someone getting traded, someone getting fired,\" Embiid says. \"Don't ask me about if we should sign and if we should trade anybody.\"</p><p>It's a principled stance, but it's also a desire to have something his talent and status will not allow him: innocence. When Embiid plays his latest sports video game obsession, \"MLB The Show,\" he trades and trades until his team is invulnerable, only then does he play, securing in make believe what he cannot in life -- a guarantee against his doubts, his silence, his bad luck, his frailty, his complicity.</p><p>\"No one knows this, but even James [Harden] is not talking to me,\" Embiid tells me. \"That's the part I don't like about being 'that guy,' because it puts you in the middle of those situations. Because if you ask James, he probably believes I had something to do with him not being here. And I'm just like, 'I won the scoring title. You won the assists title. We had a pick-and-roll that was unstoppable.'\"</p><p>\"It hurts when you feel like you haven't done anything wrong,\" he continues. \"When you think you have a relationship like that with somebody ... you lose a lot.\"</p><hr><p><b>EMBIID INVITED MARCY</b> and Ric Hansen to a Sixers game last fall in Orlando. They waited by the locker rooms after the buzzer, taking pictures with Nurse and a couple of players until Embiid was dressed. Marcy sent me a picture of the three of them from that night. Embiid, wearing a cream sweat suit, stands between her and Rick, arms around them both.</p><p>\"She's one of my favorite persons,\" Embiid says of Marcy. \"She was great to me.\"</p><p>\"We talked about his son,\" Hansen says of the reunion. \"And I know that he's going through stuff. But I feel like he's settled, he's good.\"</p><p>She starts to cry softly.</p><p>\"I wish I could see him more. And he probably wouldn't even understand that,\" she says. \"I'm a mom. And I gave my heart to him as a mom. And I don't know that he ever received it that way.\"</p><p>Kim Caspare has a 5- and 2-year-old, but friends call Embiid her oldest kid. The first time we speak, she's on her way to relieve the babysitter. When I bring up a picture of her and Embiid hugging after he won his MVP award, she starts sobbing.</p><p>\"I just know how many hours we put in that were not seen, that nobody knows about ... 365 days, I think we worked 355 of those days that year,\" she says. \"Finally, he was seen. He held an entire team. The 76ers weren't that great then. He was the guy that got them great. He was that. He was the one.\"</p><p>She and Embiid stopped working together after the Olympics. There was no longer any way to balance working with Embiid with the needs of her family. She's based primarily in her New York offices, where she works with athletes throughout the NBA.</p><p>The pressures of spring and summer 2024 -- the Knicks series and the turnaround to make it to Paris, the worrying about Embiid's health with a major contract extension hanging in the balance -- took a toll on their working relationship.</p><p>\"I felt really helpless sometimes,\" she says. \"I lost my guy. He's not in tune. I don't know. It was weird.\" He still showed up for her. He still worked hard. But he grew distant.</p><p>Embiid knows working with him on his body is an all-consuming job. He understands why Caspare had to break away, but if it were up to him, and her family situation allowed, they would still be working together.</p><p>We're on the phone and I hear something in his voice, something guarded, far different from the person who just counted out hugs with his son.</p><p>\"Can I ask you something personal?\" I say, which is ridiculous. Everything we talk about is personal.</p><p>A little pause. \"Yeah,\" he says.</p><p>\"Is that relationship OK?\"</p><p>\"If you want me to be honest,\" he says. \"I'll be honest.\"</p><p>His voice takes on a hard edge: \"We all have a job to do and my job, obviously, is to go out on the basketball court and produce.\"</p><p>Then it softens; he's about to show his wounds: \"It just wasn't the same anymore. So, I felt like everything kind of changed when things got bad.\"</p><p>And I can hear it now, he thinks he's found another betrayal, another abandonment. He cannot see that maybe this time, the roles are reversed: \"You want people to be there when things are going great, and when things are going bad, you want the same people that you trust. And I felt like that wasn't the case.\"</p><p>He and Caspare text every couple of months. When his relationships go sour, they tend to lapse into silence. He retreats into his formidable privacy. Caspare thinks this is the first year she won't be invited to Arthur's birthday party.</p><p>\"You never know with Joel,\" she says.</p><p>I asked if that was hard for her.</p><p>\"I gave my entire life to him -- nine years,\" she says. \"Yeah, it's kind of hard to fathom that.\"</p><hr><p><b>WHEN EMBIID AND I</b> speak for the final time in late June, he tells me he's making some changes this offseason.</p><p>\"We're not going to push anything,\" he says. \"For my whole career, I felt like we never took that approach.\"</p><p>A week before, Morey had said he was hopeful Embiid would be back in time for training camp in September.</p><p>\"We don't have a timeline,\" Embiid tells me. \"Hopefully, sooner rather than later.\"</p><p>I ask if the organization supports his new, patient approach.</p><p>\"I don't know how they feel. The only thing I'd say is -- this is a business,\" Embiid tells me. \"It's all about the results. ... If I come back early enough and I'm still not myself, guess what? You're not winning any games.\"</p><p>Embiid, who says the only \"stain\" on his career is being ringless, spent the postseason a picture of thwarted desire, too pained to watch any games, too pained not to pore over the box scores. \"I wanted nothing to do with the playoffs,\" he says. Because of rehab, he hasn't stepped on a court. He resorted to texting his friend and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"547fc042-3e02-4795-9637-9ab84322b625\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-pacers\">Pacers</a>' star <a data-player-guid=\"c4a0ba92-4e50-60af-a617-3345255115a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396993/tyrese-haliburton\">Tyrese Haliburton</a> to offer encouragement during Indiana's run to the Finals.</p><p>It was Haliburton who coaxed Embiid back toward the game. \"He kind of got to me, he kept trying to convince me to watch,\" Embiid says. He tuned in to see Haliburton close out the Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals.</p><p>He ignored the Finals too until the lure of Game 7 proved irresistible.</p><p>When Haliburton went down about five minutes left in the first quarter, his right Achilles torn, Embiid turned the game off in disgust. \"Unbelievable,\" he says. \"I kind of shed a tear.\"</p><hr><p><b>WE'RE TALKING REGRET</b>. Still in his high-curtained piano room. By now, it's early evening, the light is starting to dim.</p><p>\"I wish I had someone that could have told me,\" Embiid starts to say. \"You know, when you're young...\"</p><p>He stops, swerves into a surprising confession, unsolicited. He showed up late to the arena the night he scored 70. One of basketball's greatest scoring feats was tossed off by a player who had to scramble into his jersey, lace his sneakers in a hurry and skip his warmup. He's half sheepish, half bragging when he says it.</p><p>I watch him, try to read his face. I don't believe him at first. \"You didn't just casually say you showed up and dropped 70 without warming up, did you?\"</p><p>He looks at me and says, \"I guess.\"</p><p>And for a second, I can't tell, hours into talking to him, months into looking at him, whether this is one of his tests of my credulity. But his smile starts to tell, slow and sly until it cracks into laughter, and I know -- he's serious.</p><p>He takes me on a sentimental journey, one with familiar steps. First, he fesses up: \"That's not the right approach. The right approach would be to come in, get your lift in.\"</p><p>Then manages, just about, to look himself in the eye: \"When I was younger, I still took care of myself but not enough.\"</p><p>He takes a breathless step forward, near to the dark heart of it, the narrative that buttresses all the others, <i>What if Joel did this to himself, what if he's to blame</i>: \"I don't know if that could've played a role in some of the injuries that I've had.\"</p><p>Before retreating into safety consolation: \"How do you stop someone elbowing you in the face,\" he asks. \"How do you stop someone falling on your knee? You can't stop that. And it happened, a meniscus tear, because someone fell on your knee. It doesn't matter what type of preparation you do.\"</p><p>His weaknesses and his misfortune are no truer than his courage, his strength, his sacrifices, his astonishing ascent. He has made and is made of all of it.</p><p>\"It's not like I didn't prepare myself. I did,\" he says. Embiid stirs, fists stuffed in the front of his T-shirt, and barely contains the eddying of unreconciled things. He burrows in. There's no place in him safer than this, no narrative more perceptive or elaborately justifying -- he's taking his long view. How far he's come, how much it's cost and how much he's done, the miracle of it.</p><p>\"Because if I didn't prepare myself and I didn't work hard, there's no way you start playing at 16 and you get to this level, it's impossible, I don't care what anybody says, and...\"</p><p>And you know the rest.</p>\n</div></div>"

Thanks to a rule change three years ago, baseball unveiled its version of penalty kicks in soccer or a shootout in hockey: Break a tie after nine innings via a Home Run Derby-style swing-off. And there was perhaps no one on the planet better to meet the moment than Schwarber, the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> slugger, who homered on all three of his swings in the impromptu batting practice session to propel the NL to the win (6-6, with a 4-3 edge in homers) in the Midsummer Classic.</p><p>For an All-Star Game that has grown relatively stale in recent years, larded with pitching changes and substitutions, the swing-off lent it an air of freshness and excitement. Amid all of the oddities -- Atlanta Braves fans at a sold-out Truist Park cheering on a star from their hated rival, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> players urging on Schwarber, all of it against the backdrop of the NL blowing a 6-0 lead -- the one constant was Schwarber playing hero at a time of import.</p><p>As the American League blitzed back from a half-dozen-run deficit, the possibility of the swing-off was tantalizingly close -- not just for the wide swath of fans who hadn't known that Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association had agreed to a sudden-death All-Star Game derby, but for the players who had stuck around until the end of the game to bear witness to a contest teeming with pressure -- particularly for an exhibition.</p><p>The rules were simple: NL manager Dave Roberts and AL manager Aaron Boone selected three players and one alternate to take three swings. The team with the most home runs wins the game. As nice as it would have been for <a data-player-guid=\"04a76996-4a5c-456d-8022-a9d45e3ff933\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a> to participate, when they made their choices in the days leading up to the game, both managers selected players they anticipated would be warm from finishing on the field: Schwarber, Mets first baseman <a data-player-guid=\"33ba43fd-9a28-0e56-1012-5c9e5881a570\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37498/pete-alonso\">Pete Alonso</a> and Diamondbacks third baseman <a data-player-guid=\"1a1ec65f-a81f-8ce9-9f38-7275b93a2474\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez\">Eugenio Suarez</a> for the NL, countering <a data-player-guid=\"0fc2e345-a28a-9c20-023a-e80747e8d0d0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40926/brent-rooker\">Brent Rooker</a> of the A's, Mariners outfielder <a data-player-guid=\"ff4e0d11-a441-34db-29d8-8567b71547b7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36488/randy-arozarena\">Randy Arozarena</a> and Tampa Bay first baseman <a data-player-guid=\"4d197bc2-9bdd-0f37-fb96-21bd05f8ce1e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40810/jonathan-aranda\">Jonathan Aranda</a>.</p><p>Late in the game, with the possibility of a tie three outs away, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> bench coach Danny Lehmann approached Marlins outfielder <a data-player-guid=\"8359e8e4-86e5-3587-bbd4-5c729d0d54f7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42796/kyle-stowers\">Kyle Stowers</a> and told him if the game did indeed go extra innings, he would need to hit for Suarez, who was removed from the game after being hit by a 100 mph pitch on his hand.</p><p>\"You're f---ing with me,\" Stowers said.</p><p>\"No, I'm seriously not,\" Lehmann said. \"This is real.\"</p><p>\"You're kidding,\" Stowers said.</p><p>\"I'm serious,\" Lehmann said.</p><p>\"I thought I was the young guy getting teased,\" Stowers later said. \"Lo and behold, after the game ends, the managers meet up. And I think, 'This might be for real.'\"</p><p>Boone and Roberts had a finite group from which to choose. Around half the players were gone from the stadium, already headed home after a long, hot week here. Those who stuck around were rewarded with an urgent, entertaining gimmick that put players in a crucible, cranked the temperature and challenged them not to melt.</p><p>The format differed from the Home Run Derby the previous night, during which Seattle catcher <a data-player-guid=\"6c27dcb5-a741-d526-b5ac-f3988e288a70\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41292/cal-raleigh\">Cal Raleigh</a> won a contest that required stamina to make it through minuteslong rounds. The swing-off was different -- reminiscent of the bonus rounds in the Derby during which fans get to admire home runs without the specter of another ball flying off the bat soon thereafter.</p><p>Ohtani wasn't there. Neither was Judge. And it didn't really matter, because the players were undeniably into the results, the sort of reaction that lent credibility to the format. After the AL tied the game on an infield hit from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41996/steven-kwan\">Steve Kwan</a> with two outs and two strikes in the ninth, reigning AL Cy Young winner <a data-player-guid=\"2e709af2-d8bb-3d70-978d-f33a50695c14\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42409/tarik-skubal\">Tarik Skubal</a> -- already in the clubhouse and in his street clothes -- and Kansas City left-hander <a data-player-guid=\"115397d1-d7cb-90d6-43dd-36f2df479e17\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41201/kris-bubic\">Kris Bubic</a> were happy to follow the lead of Minnesota right-hander <a data-player-guid=\"9b1bacc4-95aa-3a7c-903c-52669d180c7a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42450/joe-ryan\">Joe Ryan</a>, who said: \"We gotta go out and watch this.\"</p><p>They saw a show. And showmanship. And a comeback from a 2-1 deficit after Rooker hit two of his three swings out and Stowers parked one home run. And of course it was delivered by the ultimate showman, Schwarber. The 32-year-old introduced himself a decade ago with five home runs in his first postseason and then equaled that number in the 2023 NL Championship Series. All told, he has 21 homers in 69 postseason games. This was nothing, Schwarber being Schwarber, launching titanic shots in the most opportune of scenarios.</p><p>Even though he never takes batting practice on the field, Schwarber was perfectly thrilled to break that habit for the sake of the NL. With Dodgers third-base coach Dino Ebel throwing, Schwarber used a brand-new bat -- a 99 mph <a data-player-guid=\"1c3e51f0-e619-be48-8aac-443cc62d5b44\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30442/aroldis-chapman\">Aroldis Chapman</a> sinker had broken his lumber in the ninth inning -- and then lined his first swing over the fence to center field. He followed with a high parabola 461 feet into right-center. His final swing was classic Schwarber, taking him down to his back knee, as if he were proposing the swing-off end right there with his third home run, down the right-field line.</p><p>It didn't, not officially: Aranda, one of the breakout hitters of the first half, stepped up and proceeded to hit one ball off Truist Park's brick wall in the outfield. He didn't come close to a home run with two others. NL players rejoiced around Schwarber, leaving Alonso with nothing to do but celebrate the win.</p><p>\"I don't think I'd like that in-season if we lost on it,\" <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a> reliever <a data-player-guid=\"ddbf0d6d-baee-e5d0-46db-ad9b34a08666\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32145/jason-adam\">Jason Adam</a> said. \"But for this setting, it was awesome.\"</p><p>Almost everyone in both clubhouses shared Adam's sentiment. The exigency of a limited-swing Derby -- and the difficulty in going from game to batting practice with essentially a moment's notice -- transfixed players. And the audience, though understandably lamenting the absenteeism of some of the game's biggest stars, mostly embraced the idea as novelty done right.</p><p>\"There's probably a world where you could see that in the future, where maybe it's in some regular-season mix,\" Boone said. \"I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if people start talking about it like that. Obviously, I don't think that should happen, necessarily, or would at any time in the near future. But I've got to say, it was pretty exciting.\"</p><p>Already Tuesday had offered an All-Star Game filled with firsts. The inclusion of the automated ball-strike challenge system saw borderline ball-strike calls overturned by a simple tap on the head. Amid an outing in which he threw nine of his 18 pitches at 100-plus mph, rookie sensation <a data-player-guid=\"0ea828df-ab12-3e43-8900-dee0563e68d4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080761/jacob-misiorowski\">Jacob Misiorowski</a> unleashed an ungodly 98.1 mph slider so nasty it awed players in both dugouts.</p><p>In the end, it was an electric night for baseball, with Schwarber serving as the conduit. And when Jon Shestakofsky of the National Baseball Hall of Fame went to collect the bat Schwarber used to go 3-for-3 -- a decade after Schwarber gave the Hall his bat used to collect the MVP award of the Futures Game -- he noticed not a single scratch or sign that the bat had even been used.</p><p>\"No ball marks when you flush it,\" Schwarber said.</p><p>He had indeed -- and in the process lent validity to the idea that the swing-off could be an entertaining way to cap All-Star week. Players around both clubhouses said they would consider signing up for the swing-off next year -- and Stowers said the swing-off made him want to participate in the Home Run Derby in the future. The champion of this year's Derby was perfectly content to share the spotlight with Schwarber.</p><p>\"It's good for the game, it's good for baseball, it's good for the fans,\" Raleigh said.</p><p>And that's the point, right? All of the consternation over Misiorowski making the NL team after just 25⅔ major league innings ignored a fundamental element of All-Star week -- as much as it's to reward the players, it's to grow the game's fandom, too.</p><p>Tuesday's swing-off was baseball balm, surprisingly comforting, and sent the game into its second half with momentum. The trade deadline will provide that tension for the next two weeks and pennant races thereafter. The game is in a good place because it is evermore the realm of the unforeseen and unknowable.</p><p>We might not get many of these -- only 13 past Midsummer Classics have gone to extra innings -- which will only increase its charm, allowing the swing-off to become the most pleasant of surprises. As we saw Tuesday, there is glory in the pressure, the stress, the thrill of knowing you've got only three swings. It's a beautiful little distillation of baseball, exceptional in portioned doses.</p>\n</div></div>"

It also had many wondering what the 2025-26 season holds for Indiana.</p><p>After losing <a data-player-guid=\"c4a0ba92-4e50-60af-a617-3345255115a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396993/tyrese-haliburton\">Tyrese Haliburton</a> to an Achilles tear and <a data-player-guid=\"a61d70b4-d544-33c8-3eb9-aa6e5074f97e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3133628/myles-turner\">Myles Turner</a> as a free agent to the Bucks, the Pacers are facing an uphill battle to defend their Eastern Conference championship and rebuild their team. In the meantime, the Pacers are expecting an offense that could look much different next season and will almost certainly not be as high-octane without Haliburton running the show, team sources told ESPN. Instead, the Pacers are likely going to lean into the strengths of <a data-player-guid=\"175da6ce-ca4a-d4af-7ad0-cba0c8486080\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395712/andrew-nembhard\">Andrew Nembhard</a> as a ball handler. He doesn't have the same burst as Haliburton, especially as a scorer, but is a good decision-maker with good timing in the half court.</p><p>A few executives also pointed to <a data-player-guid=\"5bee0335-89c7-30ba-9cdc-097e17878ac6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683634/bennedict-mathurin\">Bennedict Mathurin</a> as someone they believe will pick up the scoring slack left by those two absences. They'll be keeping a close eye on him this season to see how he handles a primary scoring role. <i> -- Jamal Collier </i></p><hr><h2>Negotiations between <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\">Chicago Bulls</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"501894e4-c167-38d3-8dda-8412203e3fcf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4871145/josh-giddey\">Josh Giddey</a> are ongoing</h2><p>The stalemate between Giddey and the Bulls continues into another week as the market for restricted free agents remains cold. Giddey was present in Las Vegas and had lunch with Bulls coach Billy Donovan, sources told ESPN, and Bulls executives were scheduled to meet with Giddey's agent during the week.</p><p>Multiple sources told ESPN they expect Giddey and the Bulls to eventually come to a contract agreement, and the two sides have had some positive discussions. Yet, Giddey has been seeking a contract for approximately $30 million annually. With little cap space available this summer, Giddey's options for alternatives outside of Chicago dried up quickly, giving the Bulls leverage to hold off for a more team-friendly deal. <i> -- Collier </i></p><hr><h2>Execs ring the alarms on 2027 draft</h2><p>After a banner 2026 class, executives are concerned about what's next</p><p>Bleary-eyed executives have barely had a chance to turn the page on the 2025 NBA draft class. Still, they are already moving full throttle into the next draft cycle, with a busy summer in store headlined by FIBA tournaments, grassroots events, sneaker company camps and college practices.</p><p>The most forward-thinking of those executives are already ringing alarm bells in their front offices for the 2027 NBA draft, which appears to be an especially weak group of rising high school seniors and international players born in 2007 and 2008.</p><p>\"This is one of the weakest high school classes I've seen in a long time,\" one grizzled talent evaluator with extensive experience in the amateur youth space told ESPN.</p><p>\"There might not be a single All-Star in this group, and after the first few prospects, I'm not sure how many NBA starters I see either from the other five-star recruits. New players always emerge, but by now we usually have a pretty good idea of who the most elite prospects are, and it's looking like slim pickings, even more so than the weak 2024 NBA draft, which at least had several high-end international prospects we could point to.\"</p><p>College coaches making the rounds at summer league have echoed similar thoughts, saying they've been largely underwhelmed by the lack of star power among prospects ranked at the top of the 2026 recruiting class. This is causing them to plan on being even more aggressive in the transfer portal rather than spending significant sums on five-star prospects who might not be good enough to make impacts as freshmen at the college level.</p><p>This development could also have major implications on how aggressive NBA teams decide to be in dangling 2027 first-round picks while potentially repressing the appetite for teams considering tanking their way to a high draft pick. It also puts significant pressure on rebuilding teams to ensure they are in position to land in the talent-rich top five of the 2026 draft, which features five All-Star or franchise-caliber prospects: high-schoolers Darryn Peterson, AJ Dybantsa, Cam Boozer, Nate Ament and Mikel Brown.</p><p>NBA teams are hoping to find new prospects who emerge at next week's FIBA U18 EuroBasket tournament in Belgrade, Serbia. Last year's event yielded six first-round picks, not including a seventh international prospect in <a data-player-guid=\"fb0aca8f-4878-3010-abe0-05b507191367\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5175643/egor-demin\">Egor Demin</a>, who would have participated had his Russian national team not been banned because of the war in Ukraine. <i> -- Jonathan Givony </i></p><hr><h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5217746/yang-hansen\">Yang Hansen</a> impresses</h2><p>The biggest surprise of the draft was the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a>, who seemingly reached to take 7-foot-2 big man Hansen with the No. 16 pick a year after drafting 7-2 center <a data-player-guid=\"069d1202-d59b-31e4-9f66-db1e56f009f4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5105565/donovan-clingan\">Donovan Clingan</a> in the lottery.</p><p>But in his first moments under the lights, his skill level impressed rival coaches and executives, particularly with his passing. He's going to be a project, but it didn't take long to see why Portland was interested in him. Some observers wondered how he will handle the pace in the NBA in the long term. But Hansen, who has said he's a fan of <a data-player-guid=\"22f57511-06ae-1587-f01b-33965365ce0d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3112335/nikola-jokic\">Nikola Jokic</a>, is going to remain a subject of interest heading into next season, especially in seeing how quickly he can adapt to the league -- and how he and Clingan will coexist. <i> -- Tim Bontemps </i></p><hr><h2>The most interesting move to watch</h2><p>As the NBA considers expansion, with Las Vegas and Seattle <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/41286389/nba-expansion-cities-draft-teams-leagues-line\">the most likely destinations</a>, one battle to watch is which team might slide to the Eastern Conference to accommodate two newcomers in the West.

I think getting Bill Belichick to come to the Patriots in 1999 was a big risk, and I got hammered in the Boston area, but he was with us for 24 years.\"</p><p>\"And we did OK,\" Kraft added, wryly.</p><p>A certain first-ballot Hall of Famer, Belichick compiled a 266-121 record with the Patriots, won 17 AFC East titles, appeared 13 times in the AFC Championship Game and won a record six Super Bowl titles.</p><p>Belichick declined to name the previous coaches he said had warned him to stay away from New England. One was likely Bill Parcells, Belichick's mentor and former boss who criticized Kraft's outsized role in personnel decisions after he left the Patriots in 1996.</p><p>Belichick also did not detail the \"many internal obstacles\" he faced when first working for Kraft. One was a 2000 Patriots team that was $10 million over the salary cap. For the Patriots, exceeding the cap was an anomaly; New England ranks 31st out of 32 teams in spending since the NFL instituted the salary cap in 1994, a challenge Belichick overcame as coach through ruthless management of the roster.</p><p>During his first season in New England, Belichick released several high-paid players whom he had inherited, including offensive tackle Bruce Armstrong, guard Todd Rucci, defensive tackle Henry Thomas and tight end Ben Coates. That season, the Patriots finished 5-11. But during his second campaign, in 2001, Belichick benched Drew Bledsoe for Tom Brady and the Patriots went on to clinch their first Super Bowl title.</p><p>\"I appreciated Robert giving me the opportunity to make those changes and build a program that was consistent with my vision for a championship team,\" Belichick told ESPN.</p><p>Asked by ESPN why he felt Kraft made statements now that hiring him was \"a big risk,\" Belichick said, \"You'll have to ask Robert.\"</p><p>Patriots spokesman Stacey James did not respond to questions from ESPN and said Kraft could not be reached for comment.</p><p>Belichick has been largely silent during Kraft's intensifying, multifront effort to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41073940/the-secret-history-robert-kraft-hall-fame-quest\">burnish his legacy</a> as team owner. Kraft, 84, is entering the 14th year of a campaign by his supporters to secure him induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p>In describing why hiring Belichick amounted to \"a big risk,\" Kraft highlighted his tenure as <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"539babc5-e5fb-753b-8ae1-c15032a91ef4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns</a> coach, saying he had won \"a little over 40% of his games.\" (Belichick's record in Cleveland from 1991 to 1995 was 36-44, a .450 winning percentage.)</p><p>Kraft did not detail Belichick's run of success across a decade as one of the most dominant defensive coordinators in NFL history, starting with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"378600ea-2397-8364-8399-b7c1606a49a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants</a> for Parcells on two Super Bowl-winning teams. After leaving Cleveland, Belichick reunited with Parcells in New England in 1996, and they took the Patriots to the Super Bowl, which New England lost to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"06cd3bcf-7a86-53d4-28e7-aa049dd36261\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers\">Green Bay Packers</a>. From 1997 to 1999, Belichick worked for Parcells as defensive coordinator on a Jets team that played in the 1998 AFC Championship Game but lost to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"51042145-e3c1-0694-ae0d-f720342ff8fc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a>.</p><p>\"The Jets were a solid team after three years of rebuilding under Bill Parcells, which included an AFC Championship Game appearance in [January] 1999,\" Belichick told ESPN. \"Meanwhile, the Patriots Organization had dismantled their 1996 AFC Championship team and became one of the worst in the AFC. It didn't help that they were $10 million over the cap heading into my first season as Head Coach in 2000.\"</p><p>Belichick, who this fall will begin his first season as a college coach at <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"30776972-a2c7-1cf2-4530-1c3820f5a4ea\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/153/north-carolina-tar-heels\">North Carolina</a>, is eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the first time this winter.</p><p>In the spring, Kraft announced that Parcells would be inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame as a contributor. Last year, Brady entered the Patriots Hall of Fame.</p><p>Belichick, 73, is still not a member of the Patriots Hall of Fame.</p>\n</div></div>"

But her second WNBA season has been riddled by injuries. She has sat out nine regular-season games (10, including the Commissioner's Cup final) this summer.</p><p>Clark first sat out a preseason game because of quad tightness, though she played the following day in an exhibition at the University of Iowa, her alma mater. She was later sidelined five games across May and June because of a left quad strain -- separate from the initial issue -- then was out for another two-week stretch from late June to early July because of a groin injury on her left side.</p><p>Clark made her return from that injury less than a week ago in a loss to the visiting <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"170598de-f63a-3497-a04d-1fc514508f56\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-valkyries\">Golden State Valkyries</a>.</p><p>Asked postgame about the physical play Clark faces on a nightly basis, White responded that \"there's a level of physicality that they're able to play with against her.\"</p><p>\"I knew it as an opponent, and I see it as her coach,\" White said. \"I'm not exactly sure why, but it just is what it is, and we've got to help her learn to adjust and use it against them in certain ways. We've got to find some ways to make it a little bit easier for her. But the level of physicality overall in our league has been at a different level than it's been for a long time.\"</p><p>Indiana improved Tuesday to 8-5 with Clark this season after going 4-5 without her. She finished with 14 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists against the Sun, including nine points and two assists in the fourth quarter to help the Fever pull away for good. Clark is averaging 16.5 points, 8.8 assists and 5.0 rebounds this season.</p><p>The 12-10 Fever -- who improved to two games above .500 for the first time this season -- will complete the second leg of a back-to-back Wednesday, when they face the defending champion <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ad8ccde6-59b3-fbe6-2faf-a835fa224ca1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-liberty\">New York Liberty</a> in Brooklyn.</p><p>Clark, a 2025 All-Star Game captain and starter, also was named a participant in Friday's 3-point contest earlier Tuesday.</p><p>\"I think we just take it one step at a time,\" White said of Clark. \"We'll get some food and get on the plane and start talking about New York. She's being evaluated; we'll see where we are with that. And certainly, we'll have another evaluation, probably, and conversation in the morning, see where we are. But this group has played without her. At least we've got experience in that.</p><p>\"We know that we have a tough opponent in New York. We know that it's going to be a challenge, no matter what, and we've just got to get locked in and ready to compete.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

Covered the Washington Wizards from 2014 to 2016 and the Washington Nationals from 2016 to 2018 for The Washington Post before covering the Los Angeles Dodgers and MLB for the Los Angeles Times from 2018 to 2024.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p>ATLANTA -- The 2025 MLB All-Star Game featured the two best pitchers in the world on the mound to start for their respective leagues and the two best position players in the opposing lineups. It included the first automatic ball-strike system challenges in All-Star Game history, a rousing six-run comeback, a memorable appearance for a future first-ballot Hall of Famer and a beautiful tribute to the late Hank Aaron just miles from where he surpassed Babe Ruth on the career home run list.</p><p>But the exhibition, a remarkable show played at Truist Park on a muggy Tuesday night, will be remembered for how it ended.</p><p>When it was over, nearly four hours after the first pitch, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/game/_/gameId/401696358/american-national\">the National League outlasted the American League</a> behind <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> slugger <a data-player-guid=\"657f83eb-5046-ab51-fc42-003dd9c43710\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33712/kyle-schwarber\">Kyle Schwarber</a> in an unprecedented Home Run Derby-style swing-off, with a 4-3 homer edge after the score was tied at 6-6 through nine innings.</p><p>Schwarber pulverized three home runs on three swings in the swing-off after going 0-for-2 with a walk during the nine innings, becoming the first position player to win All-Star Game MVP without recording a hit in the game.</p><p>The American League leads the National League in the All-Star Game, with a record of 48 wins, 44 losses and 2 ties.</p><p>Officially, the result, just the Senior Circuit's second victory in the past 12 matchups, didn't have a winning or losing pitcher of record. Unofficially, it was one of the most enthralling endings to any marquee baseball game, exhibition or not.</p><p>\"It's like wiffle ball in the backyard,\" AL manager Aaron Boone said.</p><p>The tiebreaker, a baseball version of a hockey shootout, was established in 2022. On Monday, both managers -- Boone and the NL's Dave Roberts -- were required to submit their list of participants and alternates to MLB should the game need the swing-off after nine innings. Knowing starters usually shower and leave the ballpark well before the end of the game, the managers opted for reserves.</p><p>The exercise again appeared to be unnecessary once the NL took a 6-0 lead -- fueled by <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> first baseman <a data-player-guid=\"33ba43fd-9a28-0e56-1012-5c9e5881a570\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37498/pete-alonso\">Pete Alonso</a>'s three-run homer -- into the seventh inning. But the AL scored four runs in the seventh and tied the game when down to its last out in the ninth to send the 95th All-Star Game to the swing-off.</p><p>\"Dave asked yesterday, 'If there's a tie, would you do it?'\" said Schwarber, the only member of the Phillies who participated in this year's All-Star festivities. \"I said, 'Absolutely,' not thinking that we were going to end up in a tie when you say yes. And then as the game's going, you're looking at the score, you're not really thinking the game's going to end in a tie.\"</p><p>But even that process prompted brief confusion. Roberts originally selected Schwarber, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"43e14a76-ff66-49ed-24fc-2835932f99dd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> third baseman <a data-player-guid=\"1a1ec65f-a81f-8ce9-9f38-7275b93a2474\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez\">Eugenio Suarez</a> and Alonso, a two-time Home Run Derby champion.

Stowers followed with one. Arozarena then extended the AL's lead to 3-1, setting the stage for Schwarber.</p><p>Schwarber, a man seemingly built to smash baseballs over the wall, has never won a Home Run Derby. He lost in the finals in 2018 and failed to advance out of the first round in 2022; he hasn't entered another one since. On Tuesday, however, he did not falter.</p><p>The three-time All-Star, after building some drama with a delayed emergence from the NL dugout, crushed three home runs, drawing louder and louder reactions with each one. The first was a 428-foot laser that traveled 107 mph to straightaway center. Next, he cracked a 461-foot, 109 mph moon shot to right field. He finished the spree with a 382-foot dinger, dropping down to one knee as the ball soared into the right-field seats and eliciting a rambunctious reaction from his temporary teammates.</p><p>\"I think the first swing was kind of the big one,\" Schwarber said. \"I was just really trying to hit a line drive versus trying to hit the home run. Usually, that tends to work out, especially in games.\"</p><p>The pressure shifted to Aranda. Needing one homer to tie, Aranda lifted a fly ball to the warning track before clanking a ball off the top of the brick wall in right field. His last swing produced a weak fly ball to left field, giving the NL the win at eight minutes to midnight.</p><p>\"First time in history we got to do this,\" Roberts said, \"and I think it played pretty well tonight.\"</p><p>By then, the early talk of the night was old news.</p><p>This year's exhibition was the first game at the major league level outside of spring training to feature the automated ball-strike system, an expected precursor to MLB implementing the arrangement for all games beginning next season.</p><p>The rules on Tuesday were the same as the ABS challenge rules introduced during spring training. Each team received two challenges for the game. Only the pitcher, catcher or batter could request a challenge, and the request needed to be immediate without help from the dugout or other players on the field.</p><p>Five pitches were challenged Tuesday. The first was an 0-2 changeup that AL starter <a data-player-guid=\"2e709af2-d8bb-3d70-978d-f33a50695c14\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42409/tarik-skubal\">Tarik Skubal</a> threw to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a> third baseman <a data-player-guid=\"f648627a-f607-58d0-f02a-9282e6a7b5ef\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31097/manny-machado\">Manny Machado</a> that plate umpire Dan Iassogna called a ball in the first inning.

The call was overturned, ending Machado's at-bat with a strikeout.</p><p>\"I wasn't even going to use them,\" Skubal said. \"But I felt like that was a strike, and you want that in an 0-2 count.\"</p><p>Skubal became the first <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b27c64bf-4f18-f713-ba06-db1bce2394e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/det/detroit-tigers\">Detroit Tigers</a> pitcher to start an All-Star Game since <a data-player-guid=\"a9fe8a8f-25e3-3d90-b410-96f40b03a927\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28976/max-scherzer\">Max Scherzer</a> in 2013.

We love the golf course, but we've got some big logistical challenges there,\" he said. \"You see the scale of their setup here, and we've got some work to do on the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure around Turnberry.\"</p><p>Darbon said that the R&amp;A met with Eric Trump and other leaders of Trump Golf a few months ago and that the talks had been constructive.</p><p>\"I think they understand clearly where we're coming from. We talked through some of the challenges that we have, so we've got a good dialogue with them,\" he said.</p><p>Slumbers had previously said the R&amp;A would not be going to Turnberry until it was comfortable the focus would be on the golf and not the owner.</p><p>Turnberry has hosted the Open Championship four times, first in 1977 with the famous \"Duel in the Sun\" when <a data-player-guid=\"e0a0f08c-d056-38a0-88bb-2f2450ef9b30\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/449/tom-watson\">Tom Watson</a> beat <a data-player-guid=\"a05dfa7e-bea8-cc6c-f7fb-0e76cb450bde\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/320/jack-nicklaus\">Jack Nicklaus</a>. But the Open is getting bigger, and the roads are limited for getting to Turnberry.</p><p>There has been speculation Trump, whose golf courses have never hosted a men's major, might ask the British government to intercede in getting the Open back to Turnberry.</p><p>\"We have an ongoing dialogue with the U.K. government, given that we're a major event that creates significant value into the U.K. economy,\" Darbon said. \"We've spoken to them specifically about Turnberry, and I think they've made it clear that the decision around where we take our championship rests with us.</p><p>\"I would find it difficult to predict whether there will be any discussion on the Open if the president is making a visit here.\"</p><p>Turnberry is not the only Scottish links being passed over by the R&amp;A. Muirfield, located along the Firth of Forth east of Edinburgh, is reputed to be the purest of links courses. Its first Open was in 1892, and there have been 15 others, most recently in 2013 won by <a data-player-guid=\"622fce94-22b9-eba8-74e0-98fe8a022b83\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/308/phil-mickelson\">Phil Mickelson</a>.</p><p>Only St. Andrews has hosted more Opens than Muirfield.</p><p>But the event has not been back there since 2013 as the R&amp;A has been geared toward taking golf's oldest championship to courses that can hold big crowds. It is expected 278,000 spectators will be at Royal Portrush this week, the second-largest behind St. Andrews. The last Open at Muirfield had 142,000 spectators.</p><p>The Open will be at Royal Birkdale next year, and then at St. Andrews in 2027. The site for 2028 has not been announced. Muirfield has never gone more than 11 years -- except for interruptions from World War I and World War II -- between Opens.</p><p>\"We love the golf course at Muirfield. We're in a discussion with the venue right now,\" Darbon said. \"There's some things that we need to evolve at Muirfield -- the practice ground in particular is a challenge for us with a modern Open, and there's some work we need to do with the venue to facilitate some of the infrastructure that we require.</p><p>\"But it's a good dialogue, and we'd love to be back there in the future.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

He had some buzz a round or two higher than he went due to his big tools: 65-grade speed, center-field fit at 6-foot-3, 200 pounds, plus raw power and solid-average contact rate in the SEC. He barely played at Clemson before transferring to South Carolina this season, so the track record is short and his swing may need some tweaks, but this is a premium ball of clay with real performance in the best conference.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Brian Curley (No. 92 overall). He may be the first to make the majors in this entire draft class if he's pushed as a reliever, despite some success as a starter later in the season. His four-seamer and slider are both plus pitches while his attitude and amount of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGPjF0lO-_i/?hl=en\">SportsCenter-level reaction</a> on the mound were behind only Liam Doyle this season. The kid is just electric.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: There's a nice group in this class. Kayson Cunningham (No. 18 overall, connected here in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709418/inghespn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709252/2025-mlb-mock-draft-31-kiley-mcdaniel-predictions-final-picks-update\">almost every mock</a>) and Patrick Forbes (No. 29 overall) don't qualify as sleepers and I think everyone who watched college baseball knows Curley.</p><p>Dean Livingston (fourth round) could throw 100 mph soon, but will need to see progress in his command and breaking ball. Sawyer Hawks (sixth round) has unique shapes that let his average stuff play up. Joe Ariola (seventh round) has a 65-grade heater and curveball along with the slider to bridge the gap, but his execution needs refining. Luke Doston (11th round) probably isn't a big league starter, but has unique shapes that I think can work in multiple innings of relief.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: I love the two gambles at the end of the draft: Jacob Parker (19th round; JoJo's brother) might play center field but has 25-homer upside regardless and Ethin Bingaman (20th round) is a real prospect as both a power-hitting right fielder and right-handed pitcher.</p><p>Otherwise, the Snakes targeted stuff/athleticism on the pitching side and contact rate on the position player side, which this braintrust has been doing effectively for years.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/ath.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ath/athletics\"><strong>Athletics</strong></a></h2><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735333\" data-cerebro-id=\"686dcac07bd3d32baee891ac\" data-title=\"The traits that helped make Jamie Arnold a member of the Athletics\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735333\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:05</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Jamie Arnold a member of the Athletics</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped Jamie Arnold get drafted by the Athletics.</p></div></div><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Jamie Arnold (No. 11 overall) was probably the best value of the first round as my No. 5 overall prospect after basically losing a number of coin flips at earlier picks. He was my top prospect entering the spring and underperformed a little because of his fastball locations, which seem fixable. He should be a No. 3 or No. 4 starter with some chance to break into the frontline tier.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Zane Taylor (fifth round). He's 23 years old and was a premium senior sign who teams were jockeying to get inside of the top five rounds to set up overpays later. He has three average or better pitches and enough command to continue as a starter.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: I'll give you three guys I'm intrigued to see in pro ball: Devin Taylor (No. 48 overall), Gavin Turley (fourth round) and Grant Richardson (sixth round).</p><p>Taylor was a comp-round talent who shouldn't have made it to the 48th overall pick and may be an above-average hitter for average and power along with an above-average walk rate. Turley is also a left-field fit and has some swing-and-miss to his game, but has 25-homer upside and excellent feel to pull/lift, along the lines of Colby Thomas. Richardson missed the season with arm surgery, but is a 6-foot-3 lefty with a solid fastball and a killer slider. He could move quickly in shorter stints.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The A's did a solid job by stocking up on college performers to deepen the system and selected ones I liked in the first 11 rounds. Arnold and Taylor could be standouts while the others are more role-player types. They added prep lefty Alex Barr (12th round), who is 6-foot-2 and was into the mid-90s at his best, as a potential high-six-figure prep signee if there are savings on the early picks.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/atl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"122673a3-bf06-4432-6950-b8a32e52ac2e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Briggs<strong> </strong>McKenzie (fourth round). He's certainly going to sign for well over slot, with rumors he was looking for $3 million before the draft. He's a solid athlete with a standout, sweeping breaking ball and starter traits.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: There isn't an obvious answer, but it'll probably be whichever of Alex Lodise (No. 60 overall), Dixon Williams (fourth round) and Landon Beidelschies (sixth round) takes one step forward developmentally. If Beidelschies is a relief-only development project, then he's a clear answer.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Conor Essenburg (fifth round). He was seen more as a left-handed starter who was likely going to college entering the spring, then hit really well this spring (including a home run off of a Jack Bauer fastball) and got into the third-to-fifth-round area as a hit-over-power corner outfielder who may be just scratching the surface.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Cody Miller (No. 96 overall) looks like the major piece of savings to set up the pool to pay for McKenzie. Tate Southisene (No. 22 overall) has the tools to be an above-average every-day player if an adjustment to the setup and load of his swing can work, which is doable. He was a favorite of a number of teams that like to stockpile athletic-testing standouts.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bal.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9ca473b8-e73e-a33d-8ea0-b4d160be4be7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Wehiwa Aloy (No. 31 overall) was 15th on my final board, and I know he slipped below that because he both chased and missed in zone at a worse-than-average rate -- but he has also been productive at the plate, has plus power and strong ball flight, and will stick at shortstop after playing in the SEC. Getting either the in-zone miss or the chase up to average would be enough to make him an every-day player, and with the potential to be an All-Star.</p><p>On the broadcast, I pointed out that the Orioles did something like this with <a data-player-guid=\"c255b4c2-f678-3676-9909-d621a9bfc986\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4298641/jordan-westburg\">Jordan Westburg</a>, also an SEC infielder with big tools but limited polish at the plate, at almost the exact same pick.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: There are a few strong candidates here. Ike Irish (No. 19 overall) and Caden Bodine (No. 30 overall) are both polished hitters while Joseph Dzierwa (No. 58 overall) may have the best command in the draft. You can toss out Irish if Baltimore is set on making him a full-time catcher because that will slow down his promotion schedule.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: JT Quinn (No. 69 overall) was one of my favorite college-reliever-to-pro-starter projects this spring and I thought I may be on an island, but he demonstrated why in the Cape Cod League after the season: 3 starts, 14 IP, 13 baserunners, 25 strikeouts. His power sinker/slider/curveball combo are all above average and his delivery/athleticism suggests the strikes could be good enough, even at his 6-foot-6 height.</p><p>Cole Johnson (18th round) is an advanced hitter with average other tools in a corner-outfield fit. Hunter Allen (seventh round) is a 6-foot-4, 245-pound righty with three solid shapes and a mid-90s heater that mean he could last for multiple innings despite coming from D2 Ashland.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The O's used their draft-best bonus pool to mostly add depth to the system from the college ranks, with two contact-oriented, smaller high school position players in Slater de Brun (No. 37 overall) and Jaiden Lo Re (fifth round). As usual, pitchers were not the priority, but I like the upside gamble on Quinn and certainty of Dzierwa, with Caden Hunter (sixth round) having a chance to join them if he adds a tick more stuff.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bos.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6df06f6-785d-3900-4935-5fd13742e2ee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Kyson Witherspoon (No. 15 overall). He seemed ticketed for somewhere between picks Nos. 8 through 12 for half the spring, then seemed to be slipping late in the process as teams prioritized position players and Tyler Bremner and Gage Wood emerged as other collegiate righties.</p><p>Witherspoon's short arm circle is unusual but not as unique as it was a decade ago. On the right day, he'll show a plus four-seam fastball and cutter while keeping hitters off balance with a solid-average curveball and good-enough command. Any progress with his other pitches or command and he'll be a midrotation starter.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Witherspoon or Anthony Eyanson (No. 87 overall) could move quickly but Marcus Phillips (No. 33 overall, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709252/2025-mlb-mock-draft-31-kiley-mcdaniel-predictions-final-picks-update\">nailed in the mock</a>) has a better chance to be left in shorter stints and get to the big leagues first.</p><p>His arm action is a red flag for some teams, but he otherwise has the traits to start, with frontline potential. Does Boston try the risky move of messing with an arm action or let Phillips use his four plus pitches in shorter stints?</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: I'll give you a sampler platter of interesting picks down the board. Christian Foutch (fifth round) has plus-plus velocity that plays down some because of its shape and uses his cutter more than his splitter, but I think the splitter is better. Dylan Brown (eighth round) is a lefty with a 40- or 45-grade heater but average slider and plus changeup; if you can tease out some velo he may be a back-end starter.</p><p>Jacob Mayers (ninth round) was kind of a mess at LSU this year, but racks up strikeouts and has been into the triple digits. Maximus Martin (10th round) has plus raw power and good pull/lift rates along with a solid glove, but he has real contact issues. Patrick Galle (17th round) sits 95-97 and hits 99 mph, adding an above-average cutter and slider, but he threw just 11 innings in two seasons at Ole Miss.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Red Sox added a number of interesting pitchers and I'd expect them to see some immediate arrow-up seasons next year like they did with Brandon Clarke and Payton Tolle this year. Henry Godbout (No. 75 overall, medium tools with good skills) and Mason White (fourth round, big lefty power and infield fit, contact questions) were the two position players with low-end every-day potential. The development-focused Red Sox org seems to zero in on traits to be optimized rather than looking to high schoolers for upside as they did not take a prep player until the 19th round.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/chc.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Josiah Hartshorn<strong> </strong>(sixth round, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">mocked</a> to the Cubs on Friday). He was getting second-round reviews as a long-time standout hitter in the class with a good approach. He is limited to a corner but grew into easy plus raw power this spring.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Kade Snell (fifth round) or Nate Williams (13th round). Snell will be 23 in a few weeks and Williams turns 24 in September. They'll be pushed, but they both performed well in the SEC so they shouldn't last long in A-ball -- particularly Williams since he pitched only in relief and has an above-average four-seam/curveball combo.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Kaleb Wing (fourth round). He was a favorite of a number of analytical teams that are good at pitching development, with the Cubs also in that group. He's a standout athlete with a clean delivery and three pitches with above-average potential, though is only 6-foot-2.</p><p>Colton Book (ninth round) is an lefty with very light velocity but enormous extension (something the Cubs seem to be targeting) and 6-foot-8 lefty Pierce Coppola (seventh round) has had some trouble staying healthy (under 50 innings in four seasons at Florida) but always strikes out a ton of batters, even more than his raw stuff suggests.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Ethan Conrad (No. 17 overall) and Kane Kepley (No. 56 overall) give this class two likely big leaguers with everyday potential and I'll guess Dominick Reid (No. 90 overall; solid-average stuff with strong results) and Snell created some savings to land Wing and Hartshorn.</p><p>I like the combination of getting to the performers and seniors early to get the best of that group to create savings and to actually land top-three-rounds high school players with the savings, not just taking what's left over. There appears to be a real strategy here and one that worked, landing players I think will outperform their draft position -- something that can't be said about that many teams.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/chw.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8f4800c6-3c05-b3d5-8186-9750cd72a3c2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Gabe Davis (fifth round). He was tracking like a late first- or second-round pick entering the spring as a relief-to-starter conversion in his draft year. That didn't happen as he had trouble throwing strikes, connected to his 6-foot-9 frame. He has five average to slightly above pitches and some feel but might fit best in a multi-inning relief role.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Colby Shelton (sixth round). He turns 23 years old in December so he should be pushed aggressively, but he has also been productive offensively and defensively in the SEC for three seasons, hitting 52 homers in 170 games as a lefty-hitting shortstop.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Jaden Fauske (No. 44 overall). He had one of the better summers at the plate on the showcase circuit, has caught some in the past and was turning in above-average run times this spring, a few grades better than last summer. He didn't face much competition in the Illinois prep ranks but has a chance to be a quick-moving, polished high school bat with a shot for plus on-base and plus power output.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Billy Carlson (No. 10 overall), Fauske, and Kyle Lodise (No. 76 overall) are a nice group of position players who were good values at each pick. Landon Hodge (fourth round) is a lottery ticket and Anthony DePino (seventh round) has some of the better tools among college senior signees. I like drafts that have a position-player lean and seek some risk, but also add some likely big leaguers, which is what the White Sox did here.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cin.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"04b65a0b-3cca-d795-0e21-23606470418a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Justin Henschel (seventh round) piqued my curiosity early in the spring before needing elbow surgery after three outings. He flashed three above-average pitches and starter command for the first time but didn't show enough bulk; he could be one of the steals of the draft.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Mason Morris (No. 83 overall). He has a 60- or 65-grade cutter and slurve along with an above-average fastball but might not have good enough command to turn over a lineup, so he could be pushed as a middle-to-late relief type.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Aaron Watson (No. 51 overall) or Eli Pitts (fifth round). Watson might be the best bet in the prep pitcher class (other than Seth Hernandez) to be a real big league starter, giving off some John Lackey vibes. Pitts is a plus-plus runner with good contact skills who just needs to add more power.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Third- or fourth-round talents SS Ethan Moore (18th round) and RHP Myles Upchurch (19th round) could be solid additions if they can be signed. The Reds got a nice mix of prep upside at their first two picks and with Pitts later before moving into the college ranks.</p><p>If Steele Hall (No. 9 overall, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">connected</a> in many of the mocks) turns into a cross between Jett Williams and <a data-player-guid=\"948a03e2-0df4-d2e2-c11d-dbcd7d7b57b8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner\">Trea Turner</a> -- like I think he can -- or even something in that ballpark, this will be a successful class.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cle.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6ad8fa03-36bc-baab-c76a-345b6544424d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-guardians\">Cleveland Guardians</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Jace LaViolette (No. 27 overall). The Guardians tend to gravitate to hit-over-power types in domestic and international amateur markets but leaned hard into big power with Laviolette and Nolan Schubart (No. 101 overall).</p><p>Laviolette entered the year as the odds-on favorite to go No. 1 then had a very uneven spring headlined by a .258 average and 25% strikeout rate.

Dean Curley (No. 64 overall) and Luke Hill (fourth round, called in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">Friday mock</a>) are more Cleveland's usual type.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Ryan Prager (ninth round) or Riley Nelson (fifth round). Prager opted to return to Texas A&amp;M after going in the third round last year as a second-round talent. His stuff and performance both backed up this year, so he's not a slam dunk big leaguer, but he's a lefty with feel and unique angles who could easily be a back-of-the-staff arm.</p><p>Nelson is yet another advanced hitting first baseman along the lines of C.J. Kayfus or Cooper Ingle, both excelling in the Guardians system.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Aaron Walton (No. 66 overall) and Wil Hynes (No. 70 overall) both went a bit higher than I expected, and Nelson Keljo (sixth round) went a bit later than I expected.</p><p>Walton has a power/speed combo with enough contact skills and he might stick in center field at 6-foot-3, 220 pounds. Hynes is a lanky 6-2 prep righty who is polished but might not have a plus pitch. Keljo is a 6-4 lefty with solid-average stuff that was OK as a starter but might fit better in shorter stints.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: There are some intriguing gambles after the 10th round in Vaughn Neckar (20th round, prep righty with a good breaker), Evan Chrest (15th round, sinker/slider righty currently rehabbing elbow surgery), Aaron Savary (13th round, standout size and shapes with below-average velocity), and Ryan DeSanto (12th round, crafty 6-4 lefty who also needs more velo). The last three specifically fit types the Guardians have worked well with in the past.</p><p>If the Laviolette/Walton/Schubart college power bats work out, this will be a good class and also address a big league need.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/col.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f3f1ba71-05f1-a49a-0363-3b1d8e0db4cf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies\">Colorado Rockies</a></strong></h2><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735069\" data-cerebro-id=\"686efa12ac2b6424ea61f30d\" data-title=\"The traits that helped make Ethan Holliday a member of the Rockies\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735069\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:10</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Ethan Holliday a member of the Rockies</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped make Ethan Holliday the fourth overall pick by the Rockies.</p></div></div><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Max Belyeu (No. 74 overall). I thought Belyeu would go in the 35-55 range because he looked like a late first-rounder early in the season, then was hurt or playing through an injury the rest of the season. His metrics were just OK this year, but I don't think they reflect who he will be next season and in the future; there's a real shot he's a strong everyday right fielder.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Antoine Jean (seventh round). He might be the first player to make the big leagues from this class because he's probably a long-term reliever, he's left-handed and he performed well this year. Oh, and he'll be 24 in a few weeks.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Ethan Hedges (No. 77 overall). He's a later-blooming athlete who is a real prospect as a reliever but will be developed strictly as a third baseman. He has average-or-so tools but a strong glove and plus arm at third base. Riley Kelly (fourth round) has a curveball that's routinely over 3,000 rpm and continues to make steady progress.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Landing their guy, Ethan Holliday at the No. 4 pick will define this draft, for better or worse. I like the additions of J.B. Middleton (No. 45 overall) and Belyeu after that before getting into the lottery tickets and role players, with Jean as a likely big leaguer to return value while they wait on the rest of the group to develop.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/det.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b27c64bf-4f18-f713-ba06-db1bce2394e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/det/detroit-tigers\">Detroit Tigers</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>River Hamilton (11th round) and Ethan Rogers (18th round). I'll presume Hamilton has a deal done, as most 11th-rounders do, and Rogers might be less likely to sign. Hamilton had third-to-fourth round interest as an athletic righty with above-average stuff, and Rogers' interest was even a touch higher, as a lefty into the mid-90s with an average-to-above four-pitch mix.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Caleb Leys (fourth round). I mentioned Detroit's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">interest</a> in Rogers and Leys in the Friday mock. He could be a quick-mover if he's developed in relief because of his mid-90s heater and being a 22-year-old senior.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Malachi Witherspoon (No. 62 overall). Kyson's twin brother had buzz as high as the late 20s and seemed likely to go inside of No. 50, so landing him at No. 62 is a nice value. He isn't that different from Kyson, though just a tick behind in a couple of respects.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Doubling down on prep hitters who are missing the prime summer showcase events on their résumé is intriguing with Jordan Yost (No. 24 overall) and Michael Oliveto (No. 34 overall) as their top two picks, but also seems like a strategy in light of their interest in Coy James (bad 2024 summer numbers, better 2023 summer performance) whom the Nats drafted.</p><p>Scouting director Mark Conner was the director in San Diego in 2021 when they hit it big with <a data-player-guid=\"eb9b0c5a-cdda-302d-b72c-556c0201c9a9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4872691/jackson-merrill\">Jackson Merrill</a> with a similar lack of high-level summer at-bats, so maybe Detroit has uncovered a way to find value in the most competitive part of the draft?</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/hou.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"00a3015f-09ec-1b03-52af-656f5e0a18d5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Jase Mitchell (seventh round). I <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">connected</a> him to the Astros in my second-to-last mock as they were one of a handful of teams most on Mitchell as his profile rose this spring, with the seventh round being a great value. He's a 6-foot-3, lefty-hitting catcher with a nice mix of hit, power and defense who was tracking as if he might get seven figures.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Nick Potter (fifth round). He threw 29⅔ innings, all in relief, with 17 walks, but with a touch more control the traits are here to be a middle reliever, with a plus fastball and 55-grade slider.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Ethan Frey (No. 95 overall) and Nick Monistere (fourth round). Frey had a quiet college career at LSU then caught fire in the second half, becoming arguably the best hitter for the national champs. He was a designated hitter but has played some outfield and catcher in the past, and his easy plus raw power is real.</p><p>Monistere was a stats find, quietly the third-best prospect for Southern Miss (behind J.B. Middleton and Jake Cook) with 20-25 homer upside as a second baseman. Joey McLaughlin got some late top-five-rounds buzz for his raw tools as a prep outfielder in Oklahoma.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Astros were missing their second-round pick and were picking later in the round throughout, so expectations were a bit lower for their haul.</p><p>Xavier Neyens (No. 21 overall) is a big variance prospect who could be a top-100 prospect in less than a year or run big strikeout rates and be a slower burn. Following that with college performers such as Frey and Monistere was smart, then Mitchell's upside gives some hope of a second prep success story.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/kc.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"11a5df00-0945-35a5-66fe-a3a107975558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-royals\">Kansas City Royals</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Josh Hammond (No. 28 overall). Hammond (ranked 17th in my top 250) was the third-ranked of my pound-the-table guys behind Eli Willits and Gavin Fien but is the only one not drafted roughly where I had him.</p><p>He gives some <a data-player-guid=\"dbedb213-8691-b041-9a77-b34af9be9889\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34982/austin-riley\">Austin Riley</a> and some Josh Donaldson vibes; I think he's a .250 hitter who could hit 25-30 homers a year while playing an above-average third base, and is up to 97 mph on the mound.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Aiden Jimenez (fifth round). He ate innings out of the Arkansas bullpen with solid but not overwhelming stuff. He's going to move quickly as a performer with enough raw stuff to get to the big leagues. There's some intriguing pure reliever picks down the board with a shot as well, such as Shane Van Dam (ninth round), Hunter Alberini (11th round) and Matthew Hoskins (12th round).</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Michael Lombardi (No. 61 overall) was a sleeper I kept in my back pocket as the center fielder/closer for Tulane. He gave me some Brody Hopkins vibes because of his two-way college fit and standout traits on the mound that could take off with better development. He made starts down the stretch and got second-round buzz, which is where he ended up going. Lombardi has a mid-90s heater with good shape, an above-average curveball, solid changeup, and could be a starter if he can develop a slider to bridge the fastball/curveball movement gap.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Sean Gamble and Hammond both have clear everyday upside, Lombardi and Justin Lamkin have clear starter potential, and Cameron Millar has impactful stuff that could fit in a couple of roles.</p><p>This draft relies on a couple of those players hitting their upside (I've been heavy on Hammond and Lombardi all spring, a little more mixed but not negative on the other three) because the rest of the draft is likely to have a couple of big league role players, likely righty relievers but maybe some position players as well.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"053868c7-8bff-5edb-3cb6-f5490f33ef99\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>CJ Gray (fifth round). Gray popped onto the scene last summer with a dazzling performance, but scouts tempered their enthusiasm when he had trouble throwing strikes all spring. He finished the season better and showed well at the draft combine, giving teams a glimpse of what his plus athleticism could mean in terms of improvement in the next few years.</p><p>He's a loose 6-foot-2 with a heater into the high-90s, a lower release height and an above-average slider with the makings of a changeup. If he can just keep throwing it over the plate, he has a big league future.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Chase Shores (No. 47 overall, connected in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">my mock 3.0</a>) or Nate Snead (No. 105 overall). If both are left in relief like in college, then Shores will win and could be in the big leagues before the 2026 draft. If Shores is stretched out, Snead has the traits to, with some adjustments, move quickly as well.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Jake Munroe (fourth round) or Luke Lacourse (sixth round). Munroe graded out well defensively at third base and has the polish (pitch selection, ball flight) on top of fringe-to-average tools to be a big leaguer along the lines of Jared Triolo, which is a nice find in the fourth round. Lacourse has the highest breaking ball spin rate in the draft, but was underwhelming with fastball velocity this spring in the low-90s. He could break out with more progress on that front.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: They opted for savings at the No. 2 pick with Tyler Bremner instead of Ethan Holliday or Kade Anderson. Those savings mostly went to prep pitching, with Johnny Slawinski in the third, Gray in the fifth, Lacourse in the sixth and Xavier Mitchell in the 13th all seeming to be overslot -- or at a seven-figure slot in Slawinski's case. It's a bulk strategy contingent on pitching development and I like the confidence to do something different in that spot. Because it's such a high-leverage, public decision, it just needs to work.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/lad.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Aidan West (fourth round). He has some late second-round buzz and I assumed he'd go by the third, but L.A. got him in the fourth. West is a pure lefty hitter with a shot to stick at short along with solid feel to pull/lift the ball. Mason Ligenza -- taken in the sixth round (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">connected in mock 3.0</a>) -- is another likely overslot prep position player, but I'm more convinced that West will hit.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Zach Root (No. 40 overall). He performed in the SEC and has four distinct pitches that are all above average. Root doesn't look like a lot of current big leaguers physically or in his delivery, but lefties come in lots of different packages and I think Root creates deception with his delivery.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: The list is long here. Cam Leiter (No. 65 overall) fits the Dodgers' power arm approach but hasn't thrown many strikes and is coming off of elbow surgery. Landyn Vidourek (No. 104 overall) has huge raw power and showed out in athletic testing at the combine, so the pieces are in place to be a breakout type. Davion Hickson (fifth round) has some starter vibes now, so he's a nice gamble in the fifth. Mason Estrada (seventh round) is probably a reliever, but he was studying to be an engineer at MIT and was up to 97 mph, mixing in a plus breaker, though with a loud delivery and issues with strikes. Jack O'Connor (eighth round) and Logan Lunceford (12th round) could work well in shorter outings.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Charles Davalan (No. 41 overall) might be the best pure hitter in the draft while also having outstanding bat speed -- and might also be a center fielder. He's just 5-foot-9 and didn't play much center in college, so that's why he made it to pick No. 41. I was expecting high-upside, high school fireworks at picks 40 and 41, but the Dodgers saved that for later. Sam Horn (17th round) is a fascinating signability gamble who may need $1 million to sign. He has an above-average sinker/slider combo but limited miles due to elbow surgery and playing QB at Missouri.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mia.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"74909d10-eacb-1376-ef1e-d0f37d7c67ca\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins\">Miami Marlins</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>There wasn't a big gap between talent and pick for any one player in particular, but Cam Cannarella (No. 43 overall) entered the year as a potential top-five pick and battled through a shoulder injury to have an uneven year. If he can get back to his freshman year performance, he'll be a steal.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Joey Volini (sixth round). He'll be 23 in December so he'll likely be promoted aggressively to get him playing with his peers, but he's also a polished performer who had a velo spike this season and may have one more tick</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: You could choose almost any of their picks from Rounds 3-10. Max Williams (No. 78 overall) needs a swing rework/adjustment but has everyday tools. Drew Faurot (fourth round) is a switch hitter with plus power who's a decent defensive second baseman. Chris Arroyo (fifth round) was seen more as a pitcher in high school and has progressed a lot the past two years as a hitter. Emilio Barreras (eighth round) is limited physically, but has some of the best bat-to-ball in the draft. Jake McCutcheon (10th round) has plus raw power from the left side and fits at second base/left field.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Marlins loaded up on college players, in part because these were all solid values at the picks -- but also likely with the thought that the farm system is well stocked in the low minors and the big league team is showing signs of coming together. All of the picks in the top 10 rounds were from bigger schools and were picked within a round, if not a bit later, from where I had them ranked, so the organizational depth has improved a lot today.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mil.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4750d73d-d92e-b390-758c-2c7b44a810db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Daniel Dickinson (sixth round). There was some buzz Dickinson could sneak into the second round, and an assumption he'd go in the third. I'll be interested to see the bonus here, and Dickinson's raw tools aren't immense, but he can hit, is a solid infielder, has good ball flight and played in the best conference.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Andrew Fischer (No. 20 overall). He's a very polished hitter because of his ball flight (pull and lift) and patience, but also has enough bat-to-ball ability and raw power to let it all play. He feels more like a first baseman than a third baseman, but that book isn't closed yet.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Sean Episcope (fifth round) and Joshua Flores (fourth round). Episcope has now had two elbow procedures after blowing out this season, but he leapt onto the scouting stage with sterling showings featuring plus stuff and solid control against top competition. Flores has some trouble throwing strikes but has one of the best breakers in the draft.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Brewers continue to be almost strategy agnostic as a strategy, looking for value and traits wherever they can. They stacked interesting players after the 10th round, adding C.J. Hughes (11th round -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45688041/2025-mlb-draft-rankings-top-250-prospects-final-kade-anderson-liam-doyle-ethan-holliday\">146th on my top 250</a>, connected in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">my mock 3.0</a>, along with Brady Ebel), Cooper Underwood (12th round, my 140th-ranked player), Gavin Lauridsen (13th round, 183rd on my list), and Brendan Brock (14th round, 185th) in Rounds 11-14 from my top 250.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/min.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a6e97b3f-4244-98be-79a2-f4b33f3365e6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/min/minnesota-twins\">Minnesota Twins</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Quentin Young (No. 54 overall). He's the ultimate boom-or-bust prospect in this draft, especially because flame-throwing prep pitcher Jack Bauer wasn't drafted. Young has 40-homer potential and a real shot to stick in the infield -- but comes with the worst contact rate of any prospect from last summer. This is a bet that his athleticism and aptitude can take over and solve that problem, and I'm on board.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: James Ellwanger (No. 88 overall). He could move quickly in shorter stints but probably will be developed as a starter. He had a mediocre fastball shape early this spring that steadily got better and now pairs well with his plus breaking stuff for a potential midrotation starter.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Matt Barr (fifth round). The 6-foot-6 junior college righty was into the high-90s with huge spin rates and multiple above-average breaking balls but not a ton of polish. He could take off in the next few years if his command/execution can progress. Kolten Smith (12th round) entered the year as a second-round talent at Georgia and had a poor season, with injuries and lesser velocity, but still has a plus breaker and solid traits.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Marek Houston (No. 16 overall) was a solid, though not inspiring, first pick but then the Twins took some swings on less polished players with bigger ceilings such as Riley Quick (No. 36 overall), Young, Ellwanger, Jason Reitz (No. 88 overall), and Barr.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nym.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Cam Tilly (seventh round). He pitched largely in relief at Auburn but has an above-average sweeper and splitter to go with an average heater and a starter-looking delivery, so he might become a long-term starter with some improvement in execution.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Peyton Prescott (fifth round). He was up to 98 mph with an above-to-plus slider and splitter, but his numbers didn't match the huge raw stuff. Maybe the Mets try to stretch him out as a starter, but there's a shorter path to success in relief.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Anthony Frobose (ninth round). He's a young-for-the-class, later-blooming, two-way player with big power and a glove that has a shot to fit at shortstop along with a plus arm who has been into the mid-90s on the mound. I <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">called their interest</a> in Wyatt Vincent (11th round) in my Friday mock, and he has standout athleticism.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: This draft wasn't heavy on players who are \"famous\" or highly ranked on media rankings, but there are some clear trends, such as projectable high schoolers with a standout ability or two, or even Antonio Jimenez (No. 102 overall), a college player who fits that idea with big power and a steady glove at shortstop but with questions about how much he'll hit.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nyy.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2b9cedf3-ce60-0bcf-fafe-8cd055255685\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Rory Fox (sixth round). He's a former shortstop who flashed above-average stuff and a starter profile on the mound this spring, but his stuff tailed off a bit down the stretch. There were times when he looked like a second- or third-round talent and he might look like that as soon as next season.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Pico Kohn (fourth round). He'll be 23 years old in October, so he'll be moved quickly. He dominated the SEC with a fastball/slider combo and his velo was up this season, but I think the Yankees might help him develop a changeup that could make him a potential big league starter.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Richie Bonomolo Jr. (seventh round) He's a plus-plus runner and plus defender in center field who has good enough on-base skills and raw power but also above-average ball flight. It's an intriguing mix of tools for a player who I thought should go in the fourth round but lasted until the seventh.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Yankees are up to their usual tricks, getting a solid value at the top in Dax Kilby (No. 39 overall, called in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709252/2025-mlb-mock-draft-31-kiley-mcdaniel-predictions-final-picks-update\">my Sunday mock</a>), targeting advanced hitters and pitchers who aren't yet optimized.</p><p>They've found some success doing that with a pitcher from Texas Tech (Chase Hampton) and took another Red Raider in Mac Heuer (eighth round), who some thought was a seven-figure talent out of high school. Blake Gillespie (ninth round) was a big college performer with medium stuff who also could benefit from the Yankees' pitching development program.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/phi.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Gage Wood (No. 26 overall). I know there's reliever risk with this pick and some non-surgical shoulder issues in Wood's past, but he could be an impact big league arm as soon as September and he shouldn't have been on the board at No. 26. We know that the Phils are willing to pay for a late-season relief upgrade, so it's worth even more to them than other teams.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Wood is an easy one, but Cade Obermueller (No. 63 overall) could also be pushed as a fastball/slider lefty with fringy command who will be 22 years old in a few weeks. Gabe Craig (fifth round) is another reliever who could move quickly with some tweaks.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Sean Youngerman (fourth round) and Cody Bowker (No. 100 overall). Both are college starters who were seen as relief types at points in their amateur career but continued evolving. Will Vierling (11th round) was the best prospect on the Cinderella Murray State club that went to Omaha and is a cousin of former Phillie <a data-player-guid=\"93179bd5-a6ad-5ba4-c584-bb8ef99867b5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41636/matt-vierling\">Matt Vierling</a>.

Matthew Fisher is a fringe first-round talent (seventh round, connected in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">multiple mocks</a>) whom I'm assuming the Phils can sign. I'm guessing there are five big league arms in this group.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/pit.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Seth Hernandez (No. 6 overall). It seems hard to get a standout value at the No. 6 pick, especially with the most derided demographic in the draft in prep righties, but I've been fully behind Hernandez throughout the spring straight through his predraft interview on our broadcast Sunday. His pro career might just be a different version of what Hunter Greene has done.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Easton Carmichael (No. 82 overall). He's a well-rounded potential everyday catcher who has made a lot of progress the past few years, but I could also see Murf Gray (No. 73 overall) slugging his way through the minors</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Gustavo Melendez (fourth round). He's listed at 5-foot-8, 160 pounds but has sneaky pop, can really pick it at shortstop and makes a surprising amount of contact against good velocity for the effort in his swing. Dylan Palmer (11th round) is a plus-plus runner some teams really liked. Connor Hamilton (14th round) has great fastball/sweeper/athleticism traits but had an uneven spring. Carter Gwost (17th round) was a late-rising athletic-testing standout with tools.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Pirates continue to believe in high school players at high picks, which is more rare than you think, and they did a nice job getting depth for the system with solid players at solid values throughout the top 10 rounds.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sd.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Ty Harvey (fifth round). He's a plus athletic-tester with plus raw power and has improved as a defensive catcher to the point that I think he'll stick there. He's older for the class and you can imagine contact being an issue, but I think he'll be a power-over-hit catching prospect with a big league future.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Kruz Schoolcraft (No. 25 overall). Usually a prep pitcher isn't the best option for this category, but many of San Diego's college picks are lesser tools/bench types or projects with big tools. If the Padres can get Schoolcraft's breaking ball to be consistently average, he'll shoot through the minors.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Michael Salina (fourth round). He has been over 100 mph with some effort from a high slot but blew out this spring when scouts were expecting to see him showing more feel in longer stints. He's an intriguing prospect. Ryan Wideman (No. 99 overall) has big tools but a worrying chase rate.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: It looks as if the Padres plowed their bonus money into the top four picks then went for savings after that, so Schoolcraft, Wideman, Salina, and Harvey will need to carry the class, though Kerrington Cross and Will Koger are a little better than just money savers.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sf.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e072b79c-4fa1-3a55-bdcd-4d7d9734d79b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-giants\">San Francisco Giants</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Reid Worley (ninth round). He's a little older for the class and a skinny 6-foot-2 with low-90s velocity, but he's a great value because of his killer breaking ball with 3,000 rpm and multiple shapes. His lower slot helps his fastball shape a bit, so another tick or two of velocity could turn Worley into a high-level prospect.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Gavin Kilen (No. 13 overall). He's a polished lefty hitter who raked in the SEC and can play any infield position. He was picked here because his floor is a good utility player who will move quickly through the minors.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Trevor Cohen (No. 85 overall) and Cam Maldonado (seventh round). Cohen might need a swing adjustment/reworking but has everyday level tools, and Maldonado is another above-average athlete with a power/speed combo who might work as an everyday center fielder.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: It's a college-heavy group with mostly hit-first types with enough athleticism to play up the middle, then the savings from the Giants' early strategy were applied to Worley -- who has one of the highest floors among this year's prep arms because of that breaking ball.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sea.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"56d60582-088f-6848-5180-1fb04440cf87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a></strong></h2><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735038\" data-cerebro-id=\"686dfae6ea1499368b3987e3\" data-title=\"The traits that helped make Kade Anderson a Mariner\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735038\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Kade Anderson a Mariner</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped make Kade Anderson the third overall pick by the Mariners.</p></div></div><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Korbyn Dickerson. He was a later second- to third-round talent as a center fielder with 25-homer upside but a shorter track record and some contact concerns. There's some risk, but he's a nice gamble in the fifth round.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Lucas Kelly (sixth round). He has been up to 99 mph with a four-seamer from a sidearm slot that he mixes with a solid slurve. Kelly could probably reach the upper minors pretty quickly as a potential seventh-inning type.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Jackson Steensma (ninth round). Not every team had him in a position to be drafted because he sat out the college season because of elbow surgery, but he has a starter profile with solid-average stuff and good feel.</p><p>Mason Peters (fourth round) is a lefty with one of the best curveballs in the draft. Isaac Lyon (10th round) throws 90-91 mph as a lower slot righty but backs it up with a plus sweeper, solid changeup and lots of strikes. Griffin Steig (18th round) and Casey Hintz (16th round) are two more low-slot types, as is potential overpay Cam Appenzeller (19th round).</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Mariners got the No. 1 guy on my board with the No. 3 pick, then added solid values from there -- a potential everyday catcher, another prep shortstop with top 100 tools, multiple interesting pitchers for different roles. It's another solid class with some of the historical trends that have worked for the Mariners in recent drafts.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/stl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a></strong></h2><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735080\" data-cerebro-id=\"686dca3dd5fb3860ccc891a4\" data-title=\"The traits that helped make Liam Doyle a member of the Cardinals\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735080\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Liam Doyle a member of the Cardinals</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped make Liam Doyle the fifth overall pick by the Cardinals.</p></div></div><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Cade Crossland (fourth round) or Ethan Young (fifth round). Crossland has an above-average curveball and changeup along with an average fastball/slider and wasn't fully optimized at Oklahoma. I thought he should've gone early in the third round and he might have more velo coming; he'd hit 98 mph at times, but not that often.</p><p>Young is a personal favorite from the college reliever-to-pro starter bucket who has all the traits to make it work.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Liam Doyle (No. 5 overall). He could be up there tomorrow, but the Cards haven't taken a lot of pitchers like him in the past, so I'm not sure how they'll handle him. His teammate Tanner Franklin is likely to be developed as a starter, too, but could move quickly as a reliever.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Tanner Franklin (No. 72 overall) or Ryan Mitchell (No. 55). Franklin might turn into a midrotation starter if it all clicks in the conversion. Mitchell has a standout hit tool, is an above-average runner with patience and good ball flight, but the concerns are if he's a second baseman long term and that he has below average power. I like to bet on players like this figuring out those problems.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The first draft with the influence of incoming president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom looks a little similar to some past drafts (Mitchell, Crossland, Young, Matt Miura, Payton Graham, Ryan Weingartner all feel like guys they would've taken before Bloom arrived) but Doyle at the top (stuff over command, starter/relief question) was a different type and you could argue the same with Franklin. I like the evolution, for the record.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tb.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f8a579c6-08b9-7584-141d-317d0645763b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Brendan Summerhill (No. 42 overall). There were predraft rumors that he would slide because of some of his erratic play -- like how his exit velos dropped three whole grades this year from last year -- making a player with strong tools and solid performances feel like more of a developmental type than usual.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Aidan Haugh (sixth round). He doesn't have huge stuff but really performed as a senior at North Carolina and I'd bet he will be in the upper minors in short order.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Taitn Gray (No. 86 overall). He has plus-plus raw power, is young for the class and is a standout athletic tester with a chance to be a long-term catcher. His hit tool is a mystery, but there's a lot to work with here. <a data-player-guid=\"ae2e73d0-1806-cd2d-73a0-71a4e20cc4aa\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31749/luke-jackson\">Luke Jackson</a> (11th round) is an interesting development project with limited miles on his arm.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Rays continue moving along doing what they do, targeting upside prep position players with tools and a collection of college sleeper types as complements. Cooper Flemming (No. 53 overall) was a hot name entering the draft due in large part to a great swing, and Dean Moss (No. 67 overall -- Moss and Gray <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">both called</a> in the Friday mock) was a favorite of scouts with great feel, and James Quinn-Irons (fifth round) was a late-emerging college player with huge tools.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tex.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4fa2cf46-09fc-255f-74a1-2a8857b0e671\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Gavin Fien (No. 12 overall). My three pound-the-table prospects for this draft were Eli Willits, Fien and Josh Hammond, so Fien is going to be a good value almost anywhere he's taken -- even if he was taken around where I had him ranked. I think he's an above-average hitter for average and power who will stick at third base.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: AJ Russell (No. 52 overall) or Ben Abeldt (fifth round). Russell has had some stops and starts because of injuries but has a plus-plus fastball with great shape that could help him move quickly to the big leagues. Abeldt sat out 2025 because of elbow surgery, but before that had the look of a lefty reliever who would rush to the big leagues.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Josh Owens (No. 84 overall). He wasn't a big name at the beginning of the spring but slowly gained steam throughout the season with a projectable frame along with above-average speed and power projection, leading to some comp-to-second-round speculation. I <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">connected</a> Owens and the Rangers in my Friday mock.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: I'll guess Owens and Fien get the two biggest bonuses of this group. Beyond them, there are several college prospects who add depth to the system, with likely relievers near the top of the group. Paxton Kling (seventh round), Jacob Johnson (11th round) and Mason McConnaughey (fourth round) are some other intriguing names from the college picks.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tor.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0151aed9-9f11-ceae-195d-180ca603b64a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Tim Piasentin (fifth round). The Jays like drafting Canadian high schoolers, and Piasentin was the best position player in that class this year. He can really hit and has plus power, but defensively fits at one of the four corners. I had him in the third round, most had him as a third- or fourth-round talent, so I'd guess he is a bit over slot in the fifth.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Jake Cook (No. 81 overall). I went into some depth on him <a href=\"https://x.com/espnpodcasts/status/1943400522880319682\">on the BBTN podcast</a>, but here's the elevator pitch: He's a 22-year-old converted pitcher who just started hitting regularly this season, made a ton of contact and, at 6-foot-3, he's the fastest player in the draft bordering on <a data-player-guid=\"6f7b531f-6eba-302e-9fdc-4696c7544adf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4679983/chandler-simpson\">Chandler Simpson</a>-level speed. He's also a plus defender in center field and has a plus arm that was up to 96 mph on the mound. Cook doesn't really know how to steal bases or lift the ball yet, so he's raw, but he also could fix the base-stealing part of that very quickly.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: I love a lot of the players the Jays took. Eric Snow (sixth round) produced solid offensive metrics, Dylan Watts might be a long-term starter in the seventh round, Karson Ligon (ninth round) is one of the better senior arms in this draft class and Jared Spencer (11th round) looked like a second-rounder before shoulder surgery. But he could move quickly once healthy.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: I was a big JoJo Parker guy as the spring wore on: Parker (No. 8 overall) has a great mix of hit tool, performance and average-or-so other tools with excellent makeup reports. Blaine Bullard (12th round) and Ty Peeples (20th round) are both big potential payoffs after the 10th round. It sounds as if they'll both require seven figures to sign, but I have them as both worth it, if Toronto can get the money. Bullard, in particular, is a plus-plus runner with plus athletic-testing grades and projection to his frame; he's on campus at Texas A&amp;M.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/wsh.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals\">Washington Nationals</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Landon Harmon (No. 80 overall). Down the stretch, Harmon was getting comp-to-second-round overpay projections, and the Nats landed him in the third.</p><p>He's typical in some ways, a prep righty up to 98 mph with loud stuff and an aggressive delivery that he needs to harness, but his four-seam/sweeper shapes and athletic testing are among the best in the class. I connected the Nats and Harmon in my <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709252/2025-mlb-mock-draft-31-kiley-mcdaniel-predictions-final-picks-update\">final mock</a>.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Ethan Petry (No. 49 overall). There are a lot of decent candidates but no polished reliever to plug in here. Petry has three years of SEC performance, so he should breeze through Single-A. Being a right-handed, corner fit who could end up at first base means there isn't a massive upside, but he's a slam-dunk big leaguer who should move pretty quickly.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Miguel Sime Jr. (fourth round). I was so-so on Sime after the summer and early in the spring, as he seemed to be a 6-foot-4 velo sideshow without much more to offer. Down the stretch and in the MLB Draft League, he looked like a different player, flashing an above-average curveball and changeup while throwing strikes. He's a potential midrotation type if he continues progressing.</p><p>Of the later picks, I like Boston Smith (sixth round) as a high probability senior sign, Jack Moroknek (11th round) and Jacob Walsh (15th round) for their huge power and Tucker Biven (13th round) as a potential long-term starter.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: I was the high guy in the industry on Willits and ranked him No. 3 in my top 250, on the same tier with Kade Anderson and Ethan Holliday. But I was still hesitant to see who the Nats landed with the savings to justify taking a (slightly) lesser talent at the top pick.</p><p>Landing Harmon, Sime, Coy James (fifth round), and possibly Mason Pike (19th round) is a really strong outcome to where the move at the top is now justifiable.</p><p>I think the Nats did an above-average job with their other key picks, collecting a nice group of senior signs and six figure lottery tickets.</p>\n</div></div>"

I started the majors picking Rory to win the career Grand Slam. It feels like a fitting finish to win at home.</p><p><strong>Tory Barron</strong><br>\n<strong>McIlroy.</strong>  After the U.S. Open, I've resigned myself to the fact I know nothing (respectfully, if you picked <a data-player-guid=\"e22c3186-cba0-fa71-cc28-f297e92579eb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10166/jj-spaun\">J.J. Spaun</a> to win it all -- no you didn't). That being said, I'm going with McIlroy to win his sixth major championship. Despite post-Masters win woes, McIlroy showed a return to form at the Scottish Open, tying for second. He'll muster some Northern Ireland magic to finish the major season hoisting the Claret Jug for the first time since 2014.</p><p><strong>Michael Collins</strong><br>\n<strong>McIlroy.</strong> Seven of McIlroy's past eight rounds of competitive golf have been 68 or better, with three rounds at 65 or better. Of all the players in the top 10 shots gained: tee to green, McIlroy comes into the week in the best form. This win will earn him POY.</p><p><strong>Peter Lawrence-Riddell</strong><br>\n<strong><a data-player-guid=\"f7192f24-1537-e91b-de6f-3548d5989626\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9780/jon-rahm\">Jon Rahm</a>.</strong> Rahm has been trending in the right direction at the majors, and this seems like a good week for him to get back in the winner's circle. He has finished inside the top 15 in all three majors, with a T-7 at the U.S. Open most recently. He's been inside the top 10 in three of the past four Open Championships, and this seems like a good week for him to add a third major.</p><p><strong>Andy North</strong><br>\n<strong>McIlroy.</strong> Rory looks like he's back to being Rory. He will put a ton of pressure on himself at The Open, growing up in that area. I think he will handle it and be our winner.</p><p><strong>Mark Schlabach</strong><br>\n<strong>McIlroy.</strong> I wondered if Rory would coast through the rest of the season after completing the career Grand Slam by winning a green jacket at the Masters in April. He seemed to lack much motivation and even admitted it was difficult for him to grind on the range for hours after winning at Augusta National. His form has been better in his past three starts, including a tie for second in last week's Genesis Scottish Open. I'm sure he'd love to erase his memories of missing the cut at Royal Portrush in 2019, and winning another Claret Jug in his native Northern Ireland would be yet another feather in a Hall of Fame career.</p><p><strong>Curtis Strange</strong><br>\n<strong><a data-player-guid=\"8f5653c5-b2c1-8fe7-6f83-fb976c9dec5d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4513/keegan-bradley\">Keegan Bradley</a>.</strong> Playing great, just won the Travelers. I'm rooting for the story, and Keegan winning, being Ryder Cup captain, would be a hell of a story for The Open and the Ryder Cup.</p><p><strong>Paolo Uggetti</strong><br>\n<strong><a data-player-guid=\"e23e62a8-8995-6b06-42f2-018c8a27e916\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10140/xander-schauffele\">Xander Schauffele</a>.</strong> There is something about The Open and Schauffele, who has played some of the most consistent golf at this event over the years, that just seems to fit. No one has defended a major successfully since <a data-player-guid=\"bb9f978c-1e0f-b6ca-83ab-255e22dc6e78\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/6798/brooks-koepka\">Brooks Koepka</a> did it at the 2018 PGA Championship, but when the wind or rain picks up this week and Portrush shows more of its teeth, I think Schauffele will be one of the few ready to embrace it.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Betting roundtable</h2><p><a href=\"https://espnbet.com/\">Odds by ESPN BET </a><img src=\"https://secure.espncdn.com/i/espnicons/SVG/external.svg?w=10&amp;h=10\" width=\"10\"></p><h2>Who is your pick to win?</h2><p><strong>David Gordon, ESPN Research</strong><br>\nRahm (+1200): High finishes don't count as wins, but Rahm is one of only two players with Top-15 finishes in each of the past four majors (dating back to last year's Open); the other is Scottie Scheffler. He's also finished 7th or better at The Open in three of the last four years, and his T-11th finish here in 2019 doesn't hurt. It all suggests he could very well secure the third leg of the Slam this week.</p><p><strong>Pamela Maldonado, betting analyst</strong><br>\nMcIlroy (+650): No one brings more emotional weight to Royal Portrush than Rory. It's his home turf and after a gutting missed cut in 2019, this return is personal. His 2025 form is strong, highlighted by a win at Augusta and elite tee-to-green consistency (5th in the field). He scores high on links tracks and has a long résumé of thriving in wind and rain (Scottish Open, Irish Open, Pebble Beach). His driving accuracy is low, but scrambling and mental toughness balance it. Portrush is a place where narrative and numbers perfectly align.</p><p><strong>Anita Marks, betting analyst</strong><br>\nMcIlroy (+650): Rory looked great last week, finishing T2 in Scotland, and he is peaking at the right time. He dominated Royal Portrush at the age of 16, shooting a 61. The one big advantage will be the hometown crowd, which will be cheering for Rory. A win here would get him halfway to a second career Grand Slam -- talk about motivation!</p><hr><h2>Who is your favorite bet to make the Top 10?</h2><p><strong>Maldonado: <a data-player-guid=\"f7192f24-1537-e91b-de6f-3548d5989626\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9780/jon-rahm\">Jon Rahm</a> (+140).</strong></p><p>He has repeatedly proved himself in tough setups (Torrey Pines, Augusta, Muirfield Village). His trajectory, control and power work well in wind, and his Open Championship efforts are hard to ignore with three Top-10 finishes in his last four starts. His 2025 PGA form is mega strong with finishes no worse than T14 in the Masters, PGA Championship and U.S. Open, and he has the mental fire to surge on Sunday.</p><p><strong>Marks: Tyrell Hatton (+300).</strong></p><p>Hatton is a savvy links specialist, and this tournament is the perfect opportunity for him to win a major. Players on LIV are out of sight out of mind, but Hatton is one for the very few that has remained consistent, especially when playing in majors. He had a T6 at Royal Portrush in 2019, so we know he has what it takes to master this course.</p><p><strong>Gordon: <a data-player-guid=\"cf2e5e50-bc6d-4472-8298-e2743672441d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9938/sam-burns\">Sam Burns</a> (+550).</strong></p><p>He's become a steady presence in majors after struggling earlier in his career. Burns held the outright 54-hole lead at the U.S. Open and was tied for 2nd entering the final round at last year's Open, both times struggling in the final round through brutal weather conditions. I like the price more than anything at +550.</p><hr><h2>What is your favorite <a data-player-guid=\"38cbeebe-aac8-fb36-dce0-cf45436086e4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9478/scottie-scheffler\">Scottie Scheffler</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"65575c5e-0ef2-9f58-6495-42da8638a332\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/3470/rory-mcilroy\">Rory McIlroy</a> bet?</h2><p><strong>Maldonado: Rory McIlroy Top 10 (-105).</strong></p><p>Getting nearly even money for a Top 10 is value. He rounded back into form with three straight Top 20 finishes including back-to-back top 10s at the Travelers and Scottish with elite ball-striking numbers. Aside from bleeding red at the RBC Canadian Open, the strokes gained metrics are there across the board. At Royal Portrush, on home soil, this is a high-floor bet with realistic top-five upside.</p><p><strong>Gordon: Scottie Scheffler Low American (+240).</strong></p><p>This is the best value I can find on Scheffler, as this is double his price to record a Top-5 finish (+120). Weary of <a data-player-guid=\"e23e62a8-8995-6b06-42f2-018c8a27e916\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10140/xander-schauffele\">Xander Schauffele</a>, among others, this is my favorite Scheffler bet with the other two tournament favorites (McIlroy and Rahm) hailing from outside the United States.</p><hr><h2>Who are you avoiding entirely?</h2><p><strong>Maldonado: Scottie Schefffler.</strong></p><p>It's purely a value call, not a talent fade. Paying -170 for a Top 10 and getting just +120 for a Top 5 is high risk with not enough reward, especially at a track like Portrush. Yes, he's still contending while losing strokes putting, which is absurd, but these price points are inflated beyond reasonable risk. I would also bet outrights on other players as is and avoid the \"without Scheffler\" because his presence isn't distorting the top of the board enough to justify the premium. If he wins, fine. you lost, like most of the field. But if he doesn't, you want a full payout not a watered-down number just because you paid to dodge one name.</p><p><strong>Gordon: <a data-player-guid=\"6c558d7a-462d-3441-3aad-4804580a5cb1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/6007/patrick-cantlay\">Patrick Cantlay</a>. </strong></p><p>His finish position has been worse than his world ranking entering the event in 23 of his last 24 major starts. Cantlay often plays well on typical PGA Tour setups, yet it rarely (if ever) translates to major championship venues, the latest example being missed cuts this year at both the PGA Championship and U.S. Open.</p><hr><h2>Who are your favorite long shots/value bets?</h2><p><strong>Maldonado: Tommy Fleetwood Top 10 (+260).</strong></p><p>This is where you trade safety for value. His game is tailor-made for links courses -- controlled ball flight, elite scrambling and a proven ability to handle tough weather. At +260 for a Top 10, the upside is real, but the Top 20 gives you margin on a player who rarely fades on this side of the pond. If there was ever a time for him to win... it's here. Though we've seen this movie before.</p><p><strong>Marks: <a data-player-guid=\"806bd5d6-e854-c747-0815-da8c7564a44f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4251/ryan-fox\">Ryan Fox</a> outright winner (+6000).</strong></p><p>Fox is having a great season with two wins on the PGA Tour. He can grip it and rip it, and has a great short game, which is perfect for a links course. He shot a 66 in Round 1 in Scotland last week. Additionally, Fox ranks 8th in putting average and is 23rd on tour in total strokes gained.</p><p><strong>Gordon: <a data-player-guid=\"4c308ece-76d6-b5d7-697c-7d1d3535f1d0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5409/russell-henley\">Russell Henley</a> outright winner (+6000).</strong></p><p>Quietly coming off three straight Top-10 finishes, including two in signature events and another at the U.S. Open, Henley has fully returned to the form he showed before winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March. He's gained strokes around the green in 10 straight starts, an important metric given how small the greens are at Royal Portrush. Henley entered Sunday tied for 2nd at last year's Open in route to finishing fifth.</p><hr><h2>Any other bets stand out to you?</h2><p><strong>Maldonado: Adam Scott Top 20 (+290).</strong></p><p>Pure value on experience and ball-striking. He's played every major links venue over the last two decades and enters with trending tee-to-green form. At Royal Portrush, where creativity and control matter more than power, his tempo and course management give him a clear edge. The short game is a concern, but at this price, you're betting on sharp irons and veteran savvy doing enough to keep him inside the number. -</p><p><strong>Gordon: Xander Schauffele Top 20 (+140).</strong></p><p>He has cashed in this market in 13 of the past 14 majors. He's also never missed the cut in seven career appearances at The Open. After he tied for 8th at the Scottish Open last week, I'll continue to invest in Xander Top 20s in majors, especially at +140.</p>\n</div></div>"

What long shots could contend? And how will Royal Portrush play over the next four days? We try to answer some of the biggest questions heading into the 153rd Open.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Is Scottie Scheffler still the overwhelming favorite this week?</h2><p><strong>Mark Schlabach: </strong>The Open is the only major championship in which Scheffler hasn't finished in the top three, but links golf hasn't exactly befuddled him. He has four top-25s in as many starts in the event, including a tie for seventh at Royal Troon Golf Club in Scotland last year.</p><p>Links golf would seem to fit the three-time major champion's game perfectly. His world-class iron play shouldn't leave him in too many difficult spots, and on the rare occasion when he does miss the green, his exceptional short game should be able to bail him out. His putting, which was once considered a weakness, has improved dramatically; he ranks 22nd on tour in strokes gained putting (.362) this season.</p><p>McIlroy, <a data-player-guid=\"f7192f24-1537-e91b-de6f-3548d5989626\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9780/jon-rahm\">Jon Rahm</a> and others are more than capable of lifting the Claret Jug on Sunday, but how can you go against Scheffler at this point? He hasn't finished outside the top 25 in each of his 15 starts on the PGA Tour this season, and he was in the top 10 in each of his past 10.</p><p><strong>Paolo Uggetti:</strong> Yes, but with a caveat. While Scheffler hasn't exactly performed poorly at this major, as Mark pointed out, there is some tension between Scheffler's propensity for fairness on a golf course and the essence of links golf, which can often straddle the line between fair and unfair.</p><p>It appears, however, that Scheffler is trying to embrace that a bit more. It helps, too, that he considers Portrush on the fairer side of links tracks, especially its pot bunkers.</p><p>\"I think some of the links courses I've played, it was kind of hit or miss when you went into a bunker what kind of lie you were going to get,\" Scheffler said. \"There's a lot more slope into the bunkers where the ball kind of funnels into the middle. I would argue that might be a little bit more fair than two guys hitting a similar shot and one guy has to putt it back into the bunker and the other guy has a clean lie.\"</p><p>Yet, as always with Scheffler, it may just come down to his putting. Though he has improved in that area, he is coming off a week at the Scottish Open where he lost nearly a stroke and a half to the field on the greens. That doesn't exactly inspire confidence in his ability to handle another week of links surfaces.</p><p>\"I think getting adjusted to speed is always kind of the most important over here,\" Scheffler said. \"Outside of that, putting is putting. Golf is still golf no matter where you're playing.\"</p><hr><h2>What do you expect from Rory McIlroy this week?</h2><p><strong>Schlabach:</strong> I'd be stunned if it doesn't go much better than the last time we saw McIlroy competing in an Open at Royal Portrush. In the first Open Championship in Northern Ireland in 68 years in 2019, McIlroy seemed overwhelmed by the expectations of being the crowd favorite in his homeland.</p><p>On the first tee, McIlroy pulled his drive left into internal out of bounds, leading to a quadruple-bogey 8. He carded a double-bogey 5 on the 16th and triple-bogey 7 on the 18th, adding up to an 8-over 79 in the first round.</p><p>To McIlroy's credit, he rebounded to make seven birdies and one bogey in the second round, nearly rallying to make the cut with a 6-under 65.</p><p>\"You get to an Open, it's a major championship, everything that comes along with it, and I just think that feeling, the walk to the first tee and then that ovation, I was still a little surprised and a little taken aback, like, 'Geez, these people really want me to win,'\" McIlroy said this week.</p><p>\"I think that brought its own sort of pressure and more internally from myself and not really wanting to let people down. I guess it's just something I didn't mentally prepare for that day or that week. But I learned pretty quickly that one of my challenges, especially in a week like this, is controlling myself and controlling that battle.\"</p><p>McIlroy and Ireland's <a data-player-guid=\"81036860-da90-8d9e-be1e-38fdfff557fc\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4587/shane-lowry\">Shane Lowry</a>, who captured the Claret Jug in 2019, figure to have the biggest galleries following them again.</p><p>McIlroy's game seems to be in a better place after his post-Masters victory lull; he tied for sixth at the Travelers Championship and for second at the Genesis Scottish Open.</p><p>He certainly has some fond memories of Royal Portrush as well: He set the course record with a 61 as a 16-year-old.</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>For all the talk about how McIlroy might be freed up after his Masters win and what has happened instead, it's ironic and fitting that the place where he has looked perhaps most comfortable and in his element has been here -- in Scotland last week and Northern Ireland this week.</p><p>McIlroy talked Monday about embracing the homecoming he knows he is going to get from local fans instead of isolating himself like he did in 2019. You can already tell he's doing that as he takes time to sign for fans and give them nods and acknowledgments throughout his practice rounds.</p><p>Of course, none of that matters if his game isn't up to par. The good news for McIlroy is that it appears it is. At the Scottish, McIlroy's game looked sharper than it has since the Masters and he seemed content with where things stand heading into the last major of the year.</p><p>\"I'm excited with where my game is. I felt like I showed some really good signs last week,\" McIlroy, who finished second, said. \"I feel like I'm in a good spot and had -- not that last week was a pure preparation week, but I definitely feel like it put me in a good spot heading into here.\"</p><p>At this point, I would be more surprised if McIlroy isn't in the mix come the weekend than if he is.</p><hr><h2>Thoughts on Xander Schauffele's defense?</h2><p><strong>Schlabach: </strong>It's the last major championship of the year and the final shot at glory, and the reigning Champion Golfer of the Year could use something positive to salvage what has so far been a lost season.</p><p>It's not as if Schauffele has played poorly this season; he hasn't missed a cut in 12 starts on tour and has seven top-25s. His campaign simply feels incomplete after he missed eight weeks with a painful rib injury. His best finishes were a tie for eighth at the Masters and last week's Scottish Open.</p><p>It isn't hard to figure out why Schauffele hasn't won in 2025 after capturing his first two majors at the PGA Championship and The Open last season. He ranks 112th on tour in strokes gained off the tee (-.018) and 138th in putting (-.144).</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>The more I hear Schauffele talk, the more I think he will win multiple Open Championships, whether it's this week or beyond.</p><p>It seems like he has the ideal approach and attitude toward links golf in that he knows it will be difficult, he knows it will be unpredictable and yet he is relishing the opportunity to grind through anything the course and the conditions throw at him.</p><p>\"It's just the mentality. I think, when you say links golf, it comes with weather, and when you play in bad weather, you have to have a good attitude,\" Schauffele said. \"You have to visualize a lot more than just hitting your number on a machine.\"</p><p>Schauffele hasn't had what I imagine is the follow-up he expected to a dream season last year, but he is clearly trending in the right direction after a T-12 in the U.S. Open and a T-8 at the Scottish last week. If the conditions get unruly this weekend, there aren't many guys you would trust to excel. Schauffele is one of those.</p><hr><h2>What to know about Royal Portrush and how you expect it to play this week</h2><p><strong>Schlabach: </strong>It's all going to depend on the weather and wind because Royal Portrush is exposed to all of the elements on the northern tip of Northern Ireland.</p><p>That being said, Lowry and the rest of the field enjoyed unbelievable scoring conditions in the first three rounds in 2019. The rain stayed away and the winds were calm, as Lowry carded a bogey-free 63 on Saturday to set a 54-hole scoring record in The Open.</p><p>Then on Sunday, torrential rains and steady winds blew as Lowry and others held on.</p><p>\"We'll see how the weather turns out this week,\" Scheffler said. \"Weather has a pretty dramatic effect on how the golf course is going to play. You can play your practice rounds and prepare, but ultimately when you step on the tee on Thursday, whatever the weather presents is going to be probably the strongest part of the test.\"</p><p>Schauffele noted that the wind can even affect golfers' putts.</p><p>\"Putting is always tricky with wind,\" Schauffele said. \"There's some holes where the mounds cover the greens and some holes that are more exposed where the wind is going to affect the ball on the green. I think whoever wins this week is an extremely well-rounded player.\"</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>It can be gettable (see Lowry's 63 in 2019) and it can also feel impossible depending on the strength of the wind and the direction. Above all, it will require a great amount of strategic decision-making.</p><p>Case in point: During his Monday practice round, I watched McIlroy hit a driver into a 400-yard par 4 and then 3-iron into a 474-yard par 4. I watched him debate with his caddie Harry Diamond for a few minutes about what club to hit off the tricky 15th hole if it played downwind.</p><p>As Scheffler and others have pointed out, Portrush is a links course but it is unique in that there are more elevation changes than at most links courses. This makes for an interesting combination of ground game and air game.</p><p>The players who can figure out when it is right to use one or the other will likely be the ones fighting for the Claret Jug come Sunday.</p><hr><h2>One longer shot that could be in contention this week?</h2><p><strong>Schlabach: </strong>It wasn't long ago that 2022 U.S. Open champion <a data-player-guid=\"a11204a7-ef27-3f00-a28e-358ee5984e77\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9037/matt-fitzpatrick\">Matt Fitzpatrick</a> described his game as \"rubbish,\" and it had been a while since the English golfer had been in the mix at one of the big four until he tied for eighth at the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club in May.</p><p>The 30-year-old doesn't have a great track record in The Open, but he's coming in with good form after tying for eighth at the Rocket Classic and for fourth in the Scottish Open. If the weather gets tricky on the weekend, Fitzpatrick is more than capable of handling the conditions, just like he did at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, when he captured his first major.</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>How about <a data-player-guid=\"25cd1b68-2fd7-49bb-68e9-6abe8d8896ba\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/569/justin-rose\">Justin Rose</a>? Not only did he take McIlroy to a playoff at the Masters, but just last year at Royal Troon, Rose had a real shot to win on the back nine and came up short of Schauffele by only two shots.</p><p>Rose is also coming off an impressive finish at the Scottish Open, where he shot 7 under in the final round to jump all the way up to sixth place. If Rose is able to conjure up one more run at a major this week and end a 33-year drought for Englishmen in the Open it would be an epic story.</p>\n</div></div>"

Back then, it went pretty well; after all, he'd been practicing for years.</p><p>It was November 2020, and it was an unexpected choice, perhaps, but not a chance one; this was a track that connected Cardoso to home in Brazil, another time. And, he hoped, it would connect him here: a new time, a new place. There was something practical about it, too. \"I'm at a payphone, trying to call home; all of my change, I spent on you.\" There were many words Johnny didn't know in English -- many he still doesn't -- but these were words he did; words he had heard so often, that meant something. Sitting in the sunshine, recalling that moment and many more, he smiles.</p><p>\"When I was in Porto Alegre, my dad would come and get me on the bus, this was the music we would listen to, so it was already in my head,\" he tells ESPN, speaking Spanish, earlier this summer before his move from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/244/real-betis\">Real Betis</a> to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/1068\">Atlético Madrid</a> was completed.</p><p>The first time he heard the song, Johnny was a kid 200 miles from home, chasing a dream and, as he puts it, \"living alone and facing a pressure someone that age shouldn't live with.\" Some days he thought he couldn't do it and just wanted to go back, calling his parents in tears. They would come whenever they could, all the way from Criciúma, and help him through it. Now, here he was standing before the USMNT, <i>his</i> team, for the first time. Standing on a chair, singing the same song. \"Where have the times gone? Yeah, I know it's hard to remember the people we used to be.\" He didn't speak English, but he could sing this, and the team would understand.</p><p>This time, it will be different. It will when it comes to the track, at least. As for the rest of it, well, that should be easier, even after a frustrating summer with the USMNT. At club level, Atlético is a step up: a new beginning, a bigger club: more pressure, a different style of play. But they are convinced by him, working to convince Betis and the player to turn their backs on a deal that gave <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/367/tottenham-hotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> priority. This feels like the right move to him, too. especially with the biggest prize of all awaiting at the end of his debut season: playing at the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/fifa.world\">FIFA World Cup</a>, for the hosts.</p><p>Spain has been home for a year now and the language here is no barrier, his Spanish spoken softly, almost gently, the slightest hint of a lisp and Brazilian touch. Besides, if anything has defined Cardoso it is that each new step, each new challenge, is met. Even if it does mean standing on a chair and singing.</p><p>Start again? Okay, then. He's done it before. Here's Johnny.</p><hr><p>If you're curious about what connected the Brazilian named João Lucas de Souza Cardoso -- who grew up in Santa Catarina state, developed as a player with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/1936/internacional\">Internacional</a> of Porto Alegre, moved to Real Betis in Spain and doesn't speak English -- to the United States, well, he was too. So his parents showed him.</p><p>\"I'm a boy who comes from a Brazilian family,\" Johnny says. \"My father and mother went to live in the U.S. I was born there [in Denville, N.J.] but left after just three months. It was the time of the attack on the Twin Towers: That was September 11, and I was born on September 20. But very soon, we went back to Brazil, and that's where I grew up. My family was very into sport and my dream since I was small was football. My dad had been a goalkeeper, although not professionally. I played, like every kid in Brazil. I didn't have memories [of the U.S.]. And then one day we went back and visited the house where I had lived.</p><p>\"We went up to the house and knocked at the door and met the people living there now. If I remember right, they were a Mexican family. We took some pictures of the house, we went to the hospital where I was born. And my mom and dad started telling me stories about our life there. Those are very nice memories. They told me the things they had been through there, all about their life, the time spent in that house, and I really felt it.</p><p>\"They work in ceramics now in Brazil but when they lived in the U.S., my dad delivered pizzas. He worked on building sites. They lived there for four years in all. My dad went first, then mom went to join him, looking for work as well. They had gone looking for a dream. It is somewhere they had always wanted to live, and the opportunity came up. They were there for four years in total. They went, came back to Brazil for a bit and then returned. And it was in that second spell that I was born.</p><p>\"My dad started calling me Johnny and eventually everyone knew me as Johnny. It started as something fun, but it stuck. It's weird for me now if anyone calls me João, and I don't even react; ever since I was a kid, it was, 'Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...' I like that. It's like my thing, a trademark, my identity and I'm happy with it.\"</p><p>The obvious question remains, though: why? Why America? Why not <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=205\">Brazil</a>? Johnny says he always knew he <i>could</i> play for the U.S. because he had been born there, but never thought he <i>would</i>. Never really thought about it at all in fact. And when the call came, it wasn't really a case of making a choice, of agonizing over it; it was the logical next step. There was a connection, an opportunity.</p><p>\"The first time was with the U23s, and from there I kept getting the chance,\" he says. \"I had no doubts, no decision to make. I didn't have the opportunity with Brazil, I didn't have anyone coming to talk to me. It was just natural. And every time I go, I love it more and try to be more part of it.</p><p>\"The first time was hard. I was very, very nervous with the language, which I didn't speak at all. I left [Criciúma] young and didn't really have the chance to learn English with my mom and dad [at home]. I took classes in Porto Alegre and I'm still taking them now. But to really speak English you have to practice, you have to be surrounded by it. I try. Of course I try. I watch films in English. I listen to English in music. I love music in English.\"</p><p>Which is where the story comes out, standing on a chair singing \"Payphone.\" \"My dad always listened to U2, to Maroon 5. He has good taste.\" Johnny laughs, then concedes: \"It's not the typical footballer taste.\"</p><p>Music has also helped him with his English. \"I learn more than doing classes,\" he says. It's not easy, but his efforts have not gone unnoticed by his teammates. \"He's a really good guy: He's quiet but he always trains well,\" U.S. teammate <a data-player-guid=\"5fa1c04a-96b6-8ced-9461-3f643256caf0\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/225609/luca-de-la-torre\">Luca de la Torre</a> says, while <a data-player-guid=\"1ba45b72-8edb-3bd7-a0db-460d6dc67f56\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/303512/jack-mcglynn\">Jack McGlynn</a> adds, \"He always has a smile on his face, trying to make friends with all the new faces here.\"</p><p>Johnny recalls, \"The first time I went, I couldn't speak any [English] really, but I had a clear idea in my head: 'I'm going to play football. [Even] If I can't communicate with them off the pitch, on the pitch I will.' And that was how it went. ... There were players who speak Spanish and that helps a lot. They all really welcomed me.\"</p><p>Then there's USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, who is from Argentina. \"That helps a bit,\" Johnny says. \"But, honestly? It depends on me and my football. It's not the language that will put me on the pitch to play. Him having Spanish can help me a bit, but my mentality is always on the pitch, trying to do my best, trying to improve technically, physically, mentality. I'm there to help my teammates. It's about what I can offer on the pitch.\"</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45589128\" data-cerebro-id=\"685d401dedba926edab6e4fc\" data-title=\"Marcotti: Atlético Madrid a big step up for Johnny Cardoso\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0626%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0626%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0626%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45589128\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:49</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Marcotti: Atlético Madrid a big step up for Johnny Cardoso</p><p>Gab Marcotti believes Johnny Cardoso's proposed move from Real Betis to Atlético Madrid is a \"big step up\" for the USMNT midfielder.</p></div></div><p>It hasn't been the best summer, he knows; illness and an ankle injury reduced Cardoso to just 11 minutes in the group stage of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/league/_/name/concacaf.gold\">Concacaf Gold Cup </a>and not one after that as the hosts reached the final, where they lost to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/203/mexico\">Mexico</a>. This isn't the way it was supposed to be; it is also not, he trusts, the way it will be.</p><p>But there is time, qualities that come from a combination of influences; there's a thoughtfulness about the game that is immediately obvious too. At that first U.S. call-up, former coach Gregg Berhalter said he could \"tell\" Cardoso was Brazilian, and there was something in that, something in his development. He saw a hint of the street footballer in the midfielder, a toughness to go with the technique, a physical ability that set him apart. Some of it was natural, some of it taught. In Spain, there has been a \"Europeanization\" of his game, an expansion of it, an increasingly proactive role at Betis, versatility too.</p><p>\"He's just such a quality player,\" McGlynn says. \"He's very talented; there's nothing he lacks.\" That is one of many reasons why Atlético coach Diego Simeone wanted him, opening the doors to the elite.</p><p>Cardoso looks to one of Brazil's all-time great for inspiration, even if his own evolution took him to a deeper part of the pitch. \"My idol was [2007 Ballon d'Or winner] Kaká,\" Cardoso says. \"I love him as a player and all the more so as a person. The way he speaks about life, his mentality, is very similar to mine, I think. Now I take inspiration from players who play in my position. [<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio] Busquets</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"2c074cad-04d2-d28d-6162-276e9e8df549\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231828/rodri\">Rodri</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"b45856db-7abf-3a50-bdaf-251ea427b2b1\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/301894/thiago\">Thiago</a>.</p><p>\"I started playing futsal at 7 then I changed to big pitches at 11, 12. That was an important point and it helped me a lot: the short game, the intensity, and then moving onto something more open. I started as a forward, and I ended up in a position that's more defensive, but I think [having] the whole package is very positive: that you take things from things from a forward, the skills, the quality, and add other aspects.\"</p><p>Betis had seen something in him, enough from his five years at Internacional to sign him in January 2024. The club's sporting director Manu Fajardo tells ESPN: \"Because of his physical capacity and his technical ability, he can break from those deeper positions and reach the opposition's area. I see a balance in him, a player capable of performing in both phases of the game.\"</p><p>Context is everything, Cardoso says: \"In some moments I am more defensive, but I can also be a No. 8, a box-to-box midfielder who reaches the area and scores goals, too.\"</p><p>The context? A European giant, aspiring to everything. A loyal, noisy fan base, 70,000 fans packing out the Metropolitano, as much a cause as a club. Like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.champions\">Champions League</a> football every week.</p><p>For Simeone, he is the perfect pivot for the heart of the side, a man capable of protecting the defence and moving the midfield but also having the versatility to fulfil other roles. The Argentine coach has been asking for a No. 5 for a long time; now, at last, he has him. There is perhaps a touch of the Thiago about him, that combination of quiet efficiency and understated intelligence, plus the physicality to cover a lot of ground.</p><p>It is a role few know better than Mario Suárez, who played for Atlético for five years, including under Simeone, winning six titles and reaching a Champions League final.</p><p>\"I think Johnny Cardoso is not just a good signing for Atlético Madrid, he's a necessary one,\" Suárez tells ESPN. \"He's good with the ball, he is strong in duels, wins a lot of balls, and presses very well, especially on the front foot, stepping forward to press -- which is why I'm interested to see how he adapts to those phases when Atlético play in a lower block, which they like to do with Simeone, give that he's more comfortable pressing forwards, into the other team's space. In those phases he will have to hold his position more, and that may require some adaptation.\"</p><p>\"He's a great signing who can bring a lot to Atlético, who also may help open the U.S. market. He's young, he's very dynamic, he's good in the air, he has scored goals from set plays. He's very complete.</p><p>\"I think we'll see him play a more defensive role than <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/174466/rodrigo-de-paul\">Rodrigo De Paul</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/336634/pablo-barrios\">Pablo Barrios</a>. That said, if Atlético do transfer players, if De Paul goes, it could be that they also sign a more purely positional defensive midfielder as a No. 5, and Johnny plays a little more free.\"</p><p>Nothing is guaranteed. It doesn't always end well, Cardoso knows. It doesn't always start well, either. In the U.S.'s pre-Gold Cup friendly against <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e83058ba-378d-6837-d3f9-293eca20f889\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=465\">Turkey</a>, it could hardly have gone worse; <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_uyYnAGtv2g?si=NZY8TuWtGIFB7kkf&amp;t=110\" target=\"_blank\">a bizarre mistake gifting a goal</a> when, trying to bring the ball out from deep, he struck the ball against <a data-player-guid=\"5a8c6503-7351-3f24-87d6-a4304220e6bb\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/310452/arda-guler\">Arda Güler</a> and it rebounded into his own net. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/734219\" target=\"_blank\">The 2-1 loss</a>, a third successive defeat for the USMNT, deepened doubts. For some, at least.</p><p>\"These things can happen,\" De la Torre said. \"He has the personality to get the ball in difficult situations and make things happen. And yeah, I mean, the guy tackles him and it comes in off the post. It's unlucky and it can happen, but of course he gives more to the team than just that mistake. I thought he played well.\"</p><p>\"Today was just a fluke, he'll be fine,\" <a data-player-guid=\"8c60bb07-3fc0-60ad-20fc-207e6fc1f566\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/286778/nathan-harriel\">Nathan Harriel</a> added, while Pochettino, called it \"part of his growth, part of learning.\"</p><p>Johnny will learn; there is a quietness, almost a timidity in him as Cardoso talks, but there's a toughness too. Fajardo calls him \"polite, well-mannered ... and resilient.\"</p><p>\"Johnny is a brave boy, if you think about it,\" Berhalter said when Cardoso joined the senior USMNT in September 2022. \"He doesn't speak perfect English, he's 19 years old, he's had the farthest to travel to get here. But he's still embracing everything and taking everything in stride. He's a great person, a very good player.\"</p><p><i>Brave</i>. \"I think it's a word that could define me, yes,\" Johnny says. \"I'm very resilient, I'm not scared of things. And I remember that first time very clearly.\"</p><p>There's a smile. It was strange? \"Yes,\" he says. That's one word for it. The first training session Cardoso ever had with the national team wasn't with the national team at all; it was just him and the coaches in the rain. He had traveled from Brazil, leaving two days before to be certain he would get there, and arrived a day before anyone else. \"None of the other players had got there,\" he recalls. When they did, it was time to get up on that chair.</p><p>Confidence can take a while but, he says, \"I think bravery is something you have inside you, but I also think it's something you can work on. I always had the desire to learn. I always put an idea in my head: 'I'm not the best now, but it's work,' you know? You have to be strong.\" He could be quoting from the book of Simeone.</p><p>He had to find that bravery from an early age.</p><p>\"I was 12 the first time I went to Inter,\" he says. \"It was 300 kilometers from home. I wasn't allowed to live there yet because I was too young. That first year I would stay a week per month training with the team and then go home. It was a way of getting used to it, adapting, like an internship. But at the end of the year, the coach said 'if you want to play the games, the tournaments, you have to be here all the time.'</p><p>\"My mom and dad always supported me but a mother's heart when her child leaves home at 13 ... it's very difficult and I was always very, very close to my family. That first year I had days when I called them up crying -- 'I want to go home,' 'I can't take any more of this.' The role of my mom and dad was the most important thing. However much their hearts said 'come home,' they knew this was my dream, and they would say, 'No problem, we'll come and spend the day with you there, we'll be there, things will get better, it'll be OK.'</p><p>\"I lived in a house with maybe 25 players, aged between 13 and 20. It was madness. Imagine it: I get there at 13 and I'm in a room with five in these little beds. There are two bathrooms for 25 kids. Two women lived there who did the cleaning, prepared the food, as if they were the mothers. My grandad would go and be there with me a week, or my dad would come. To start with it was very difficult, but it's an incredible experience, something totally new. You encounter lots of different realities, it's an education, you learn.\"</p><p>When asked if, of all those boys, if he was the one that got the furthest, Johnny pauses. He thinks for a bit, a mental list forming, faces and names. Some were only there for a few months, some are long gone. \"I think so,\" he says.</p><p>There is a universal truth, too easily overlooked: The worst player on the worst team you have ever seen is <i>brilliant</i>. There might be no profession in the world more competitive, where making it is so hard. Those that do have something special about them, and it's not necessarily in their feet; more often it is in their mind. Listening to Johnny -- calm, analytical, clear -- you can hear it.</p><p>\"There are lots of kids I played within the academy up to 17, 18, that were great players,\" he says. \"People I looked at and thought, 'Wow, there's no way they won't make it.' Players you think, he's so good technically, physically he's an animal.</p><p>\"But what happened? Mentally they didn't have it. That's the hardest part: to be strong, to know how to handle it all, live with it.\"</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45724780\" data-cerebro-id=\"6872a4b3f9cb241c51c4b762\" data-title=\"USMNT's Tillman admits 'mixed feelings' over swapping PSV for Leverkusen\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0712%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0712%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0712%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45724780\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:59</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>USMNT's Tillman admits 'mixed feelings' over swapping PSV for Leverkusen</p><p>USMNT midfielder Malik Tillman talks to ESPN after confirming his switch from PSV to Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen.</p></div></div><p>When USMNT captain <a data-player-guid=\"4d70b696-ec86-7ac2-2239-881e594c538f\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/222776/tyler-adams\">Tyler Adams</a> is asked what stands out about Cardoso, he says: \"The way he trains every single day, the way that he brings his mentality every single day. ... He's going to be an important player.\" The errors? All part of the process. As Pochettino says: \"Now the most important thing is to quickly go to the next page.\" Everything in Cardoso's career says that too. Lessons were learned and still are, daily. The pressure, Johnny says, can be intense.</p><p>Just how intense comes up when he discusses what it was like to be in the middle of the swirl of rumours, what it is like to see your name occupy the sports pages and everything that comes with being the new hope with the national team, and a new club.</p><p>And yet, as he talks, a picture forms that says it is more than that, at once simpler and more complex; it is not just this club or that one, this moment or the next, which is perhaps why he deals with each step, the bad moments, so naturally: it is the whole thing. The life, not just the game. The mind, not just the play. And that is worked upon too.</p><p>\"What I most try to work on is the mentality, closing my eyes to the bad things. And also ... look, I wouldn't say close your eyes to the good things. Who doesn't like to hear nice things? But if you focus on that you won't [get anywhere]. Sometimes if you keep looking when things are good and everything's nice, if you keep going, keep going to the bottom you're going to find a bad one and a bad one. ... You'll always find it, and it will finish you.</p><p>\"So I don't have Twitter, I try not to spend much time on social media. Look, of course I like to read nice things but maybe you read one, two ... and then I try to get out of there because otherwise your head starts to say, 'Now I'm going to have a look and see what they're saying over here.'</p><p>\"And there will always be bad things because in the end you can't please everyone. That's what happens with a lot of young people and it upsets them. It happened to me when I played my first game at Inter. I played, went off, picked up the phone to see what people had said, and it was the worst thing that I could have done.</p><p>\"I have support from my mom and dad, always. But since I was 15, I've been working with a psychologist too. Because of everything really: living alone in Porto Alegre, living with a pressure that you shouldn't have to live with at that age, reading things about you that are from another world, from people who have no head. ... I learnt a lot with that. And I still have psychology sessions once a week. I also have my mom and dad here with me and my wife now.</p><p>From Denville, New Jersey, to Madrid, via Brazil and Seville.</p>\n</div></div>"

The 2024 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/conmebol.america\">Copa América</a> was a disappointment. Richards' passing lacked its usual sharpness, and he wasn't as consistent in his defending either. The fourth-place finish at the 2025 Concacaf Nations League was underwhelming as well.</p><p>A stellar second half of the season with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e8703d92-a160-9bbf-cb81-1be6f3fd7969\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=384\">Crystal Palace</a> saw the 25-year-old hit peak form, though, and Richards carried that level of play into the Gold Cup. His performances were on point throughout the competition, composed in his defending and even chipping in with a pair of goals off of set pieces, including one in the 2-1 defeat to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9e213fae-5b9d-d331-8b4b-33abdaf57b4f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=203\">Mexico</a> in the final.</p><p>Following that match, Richards' disappointment was evident. He even admitted he threw away his runner-up medal before he even got to the postmatch mixed zone. But he did take time to reflect on what the Gold Cup meant for him personally.</p><p>\"It's something that I challenged myself with going into this tournament. I wanted to be that guy that stepped up and cemented my spot, and I think maybe I've done that,\" Richards said after the match. \"But also, every camp I come into from now on is just another stepping stone. I have to keep working and keep playing,\"</p><p>Now the Hoover, Alabama native is one of the first names on Pochettino's team sheet, and his play has caught the attention of his teammates, too.</p><p>\"Just watching [Richards] now play, he's actually taking over. He's doing the things that I think we all really, really have expected him to do and expected him to become as a center back,\" fellow defender <a data-player-guid=\"b9b826c5-6593-d43d-806e-7704da069e30\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/146290/tim-ream\">Tim Ream</a> told ESPN. \"He's still very young, and he's still learning and just watching him, watching his growth over the past two years, really has been great to see.\"</p><p>Ream noted that becoming a dad changed how he viewed himself as a player and motivated him in a positive way. He feels that Richards has undergone a similar transformation since the birth of his daughter, Luna -- an assertion Richards doesn't dispute.</p><p>\"[Becoming a father], it's changed my priorities,\" Richards told ESPN. \"It has definitely made me work a little bit harder because at the end of the day, I have to provide for her and my girlfriend as well. It makes you want to work 10% -- f--- it, 100% -- harder.\"</p><p>Players often talk about the grind of the season, how the constant work put in often leads to a series of incremental improvements that lead to success, but a campaign can also hinge on moments. For Richards, that point came last October.</p><p>Palace had won one league match in the season's first two-and-a-half months and a hamstring injury saw Richards lose his spot in the starting lineup. The season was drifting away from him. It was then that a conversation with Palace assistant Paddy McCarthy, himself a former Palace defender, helped turn Richards' season around.</p><p>\"He just told me straight up, 'What do you want to do with your career? What do you want to do while you're at Palace? Do you want to just be one of those guys who just goes through the motions, or do you want to be a guy who aspires to go to a higher caliber club?'\" Richards told ESPN. \"He was like, 'I see it in you. I see that you can go to higher caliber [clubs]. You have a lot of attributes that I couldn't even dream of having, but at the end of the day, you have to want it. I can't want it for you.'\"</p><p>McCarthy provided some tactical advice as well, encouraging Richards to drop \"as deep as you need to\" in order to get the ball, that way passing lanes would open up more easily.</p><p>\"It was something that at the time, I think it hurt a little bit,\" Richards said about that conversation. \"But it was something that I needed, not just as a man, but as an athlete and a professional athlete. It's something that can either make or break you, and I was kind of ready for that moment. I was ready to take the next step, so I had to take it on the chin, and just keep moving forward.\"</p><p>Richards returned to the Palace lineup in late November, becoming an ever-present force and making 32 appearances in all competitions. He finished off his season with that remarkable day in May at Wembley in the FA Cup final, with Palace prevailing 1-0 over <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a> to win the first major trophy in Palace's history.</p><p>\"It was an amazing season for the club, but for me personally, I think being a part of the club that made history like that, also being the only player having played every minute in the cup run, and I think just all in all getting a lot of games under my belt, it was really beneficial for me,\" Richards said.</p><p>Richards noted that the talk with McCarthy was reminiscent of those he had as a 16-year-old playing for Texans SC Houston under current <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fa2f128b-c698-3d43-2910-5561f4442748\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=185\">FC Dallas</a> manager Eric Quill. It was Quill who plucked Richards out of Alabama and brought him to Houston, where his U18 team won a national championship. (The other center back on that team? Now-<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a> placekicker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4689936/jake-bates\">Jake Bates</a>.)</p><p>Quill recalls how he knew early on that Richards was destined to become a pro, even after he was initially turned down for FC Dallas' academy. Richards had the body movements of a point guard, which he played earlier in his youth, taking after his father, Ken, as well as Quill.</p><p>\"His aerial ability was incredible,\" Quill said about Richards. \"His reading of the game was of the highest nature because he never had to get into a full sprint half the time because he read the games so quickly, and any kind of channel duels that he would get in with wingers, nobody ever could beat him. And then I saw a few times the fifth gear that he could get into where I was like, 'Well, that's really top-end speed.'\"</p><p>Quill has kept track of Richards' career, from his eventual entry to FC Dallas' academy, to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"25b5e432-d3d2-939f-f73b-6e531a6fbd91\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=132\">Bayern Munich</a>, to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6a9e82af-cafc-b66b-3e64-0ea38a6faef0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=7911\">TSG Hoffenheim</a> and eventually Palace. Quill's assessment of why Richards has found that next level is simple: health.</p><p>\"I think he's been in [the lineup], he gets injured, goes back on the shelf, comes back. I just think when you start to get that really good form is typically when you've had a long run of games and you got that fluidity and that rhythm,\" Quill said. \"And I think that's why his game is soaring right now and he's exuding a lot of confidence in everything he's doing.\"</p><p>That includes stepping into a leadership role this summer with the USMNT. With the roster composed mostly of younger players who were inexperienced at international level, there was a need for players delivering strong performances and strong voices. Ream's steady, calming presence has long made him one of the team's leaders, but he couldn't do it alone. Richards has since stepped in and helped the team in that regard.</p><p>\"He's never been one that just sits there and is quiet, but now listening to him in a game, he's so much more vocal, he's so much more commanding,\" Ream said of Richards. \"His positioning has gotten exponentially better, and that just comes with experience. He's going to continue to get better and better, which is scary.\"</p><p>Richards says that he's gotten to the point where he feels comfortable in a leadership role. The nature of the center back position often requires directing teammates and being demanding. That is something Richards has long enjoyed, but his level of play has given him more credibility.</p><p>\"You have to lead by example as well, and I think that's something that I feel like I do,\" he said.</p><p>Next year's World Cup is never far from Richards' mind. He missed out on the 2022 edition due to a hamstring injury. He has every intention of being there in 2026.</p><p>\"It really hurt not to be a part of the '22 squad, whether it was the memories that the guys made along the way, or just the performances that they put in as well,\" he said. \"But me personally, I want to be a part of that. I want to be a part of history, and I want to be a part of winning history, the right set of history. So I think for me, this is a huge year for me, for club and country, but I think just doing all the right things at my club so that when it comes to playing for the U.S. that I'm available and I'm ready and I'm at the highest level that I can possibly be.\"</p><p>Richards is well on his way.</p>\n</div></div>"

Pogačar seemed very pleased that he’d had a ride with a proper cafe stop as well.

Whereas this England team has developed, football has changed.

Just 31 days removed from winning the US Open, the 34-year-old was well-placed to offer his view on Scheffler's comments on the ephemeral sensation of winning. </p><p>\"I believe there's some truth behind Scottie's words,\" said Spaun. </p><p>\"Yeah, you do have these high aspirations, these dreams to accomplish things in golf at the highest level, and then you do and it happens so quick.

The Bulldogs appear poised to return to a more rugged, run-first identity -- one that emphasizes physicality and playing behind the pads.</p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/457.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>Alabama Crimson Tide</h2><p><strong>Kalen DeBoer loses once in regular season yet misses out on Atlanta</strong>: A best-case scenario could unfold for Alabama this fall if its only loss comes against LSU in November.

It would mirror the path Ohio State took last season after watching from home while Oregon and Penn State played in the Big Ten title game.</p><p>No coach in college football has a better career winning percentage against ranked opponents than Kalen DeBoer, and he's poised to flex that this fall. Year 1 in Tuscaloosa was a bump in the road for a proven program leader who now enters 2025 with offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb back by his side and one of the league's deepest defenses.</p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/853.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>Texas Longhorns</h2><p><strong>Ryan Wingo produces program's best individual receiving season since Devin Duvernay in 2019</strong>: Arch Manning needs a budding star he can trust downfield, and former five-star receiver Ryan Wingo is poised to fill that role in a big way this season.</p><p>Wingo averaged 16.2 yards per reception as a freshman in 2024 but saw limited snaps late in the year as Texas leaned on preferred targets Matthew Golden, Isaiah Bond and Gunnar Helm.

The 2025 Open Championship field is star-studded with Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy serving as the headliners. Scheffler is the +450 (risk $100 to win $450) favorite in the latest 2025 Open Championship odds. Other top contenders include McIlroy (+750), Jon Rahm (+1200), and Bryson DeChambeau (+2000). Defending champion Xander Schauffele is listed at +2500. SportsLine golf expert Eric Cohen is calling for a strong performance from Stewart Cink, predicting the eight-time PGA Tour winner to be the top senior finisher at +300 odds (risk $100 to win $300). The 2025 Open Championship first-round tee times begin on Thursday at 1:35 a.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p>Cohen is also parlaying Xander Schauffele and Tommy Fleetwood to both finish in the top-20 (including ties) at +310 odds (risk $100 to win $310). Fleetwood is highly familiar with links-style courses and has three top-10 finishes in six Open Championship starts. Schauffele is the defending tournament champion and is ranked No. 3 in the Official World Golf Ranking. Before locking in any other 2025 Open Championship bets, you'll want to see what prop bets Cohen is targeting leading into the tournament.&nbsp;</p><p>Cohen, the host of Tuesday's&nbsp;<em>Early Wedge Best Bets Show</em>&nbsp;on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/sportsline\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine's YouTube</a>, correctly identified Justin Thomas to win the 2025 RBC Heritage (+1800) and Ben Griffin (+4500 w/o Scheffler) to win the 2025 Charles Schwab Challenge, as well as four winners last season.

Ties) (+310)</li><li>Top 10 Parlay: Viktor Hovland + Robert MacIntyre (w/ties) (+1500)</li></ul><h2>Top Senior: Stewart Cink (+300)</h2><p>To win this prop, Cink needs to finish higher on the leaderboard than Padraig Harrington, Phil Mickelson, K.J. Choi, Darren Clarke, and Justin Leonard. Cink is playing some incredible golf on the Champions Tour this season, with a win and nine top-10s in 11 events. He also finished T20 here at Royal Portrush in 2019. Harrington finished T22 in The Open Championship last year but has lost more than 12 strokes putting combined over the last three years. Mickelson has only made two of his last seven Open cuts, and I wouldn't expect him to make it again this year. Choi hasn't played in an Open Championship since 2014, and I would also be surprised if he made the cut. New users can bet $5 and get $150 instantly with this&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings promo code</a></span>.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Tommy Fleetwood &amp; Xander Schauffele both to finish in the Top 20 (Incl. Ties) (+310)</h2><p>Fleetwood finished solo second here in 2019 behind Shane Lowry and has four top-20s in his last six Opens, including three times in the top 10. Schauffele has finished in the top 20 each of the last three years in this event, including winning it last year. Both players possess consistency, which may be necessary if the winds wreak havoc this weekend. I would also consider the top-10 version of this bet at +950 odds under <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel's</a> Tourney Specials.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top-10 Parlay: Viktor Hovland + Robert MacIntyre (w/ties) (+1500)</h2><p>Hovland has gained nearly 27 shots tee to green combined over his last three events, including when he withdrew from the Travelers Championship after three rounds. He has three finishes of T13 or better in four Open Championship appearances, including a T4 in 2022 at St. Andrews. MacIntyre was a huge disappointment last week in Scotland, where he was trying to defend his title in front of the home fans. But I'll give him a mulligan and think that he plays well again this week, where he posted a T6 in his first major championship appearance in 2019. At 15-1 odds, this is great value for two players I expect to be near the top of the leaderboard this week.</p><h2>Make the cut parlay: Dean Burmester + Thriston Lawrence + Laurie Canter (+356)</h2><p>I put this parlay together specifically because these three underrated players have never missed a cut at the Open Championship. Combined, they're 10-for-10. Am I on to something here, or did I put the jinx on them heading into this year's event?</p><h2>More 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>You've seen Cohen's top props for this week's event.

He is also one of 11 expected starting quarterbacks that will be present at SEC Media Days.&nbsp;</p><p>Texas is one of several SEC teams that are expected to be in the mix for a 12-team <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff, though the conference will be hunting for its first national title since 2022.

first year under new coach Kalen DeBoer, or how <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> -- which lost starting quarterback <a

The AL erased a 6-0 deficit in the final three innings, putting them in position for what would have been the largest comeback win in All-Star Game history, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-hits-home-run-with-all-star-game-swing-off-in-exhilarating-midsummer-classic/\" target=\"_blank\">but the NL prevailed in the tiebreaker swing-off</a></span>.  </p><p>\"We finally beat these guys.  They seemed to have our number over the  last decade,\" <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a>&nbsp;and NL manager Dave Roberts said about the senior circuit winning for only the second time in the last 12 All-Star Games. \"But there's just a lot of talent in both leagues.  But  tonight, we got the best of them.\"  </p><p>The swing-off tiebreaker rule was put in place in 2022 as a way to avoid boring ties and burning through pitchers. Tuesday was the first time it was actually used. Each side picks three players, the three players take three swings each, and the most homers wins. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135243/kyle-schwarber/\">Kyle Schwarber</a> went 3 for 3 in his round, propelling the NL to a 4-3 swing-off win and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/kyle-schwarber-named-mlb-all-star-game-mvp-phillies-slugger-leads-national-league-to-thrilling-swing-off-win/\" target=\"_blank\">earning himself MVP honors</a></span>.  </p><p>\"Dave asked yesterday, pretty much just asked, if there's a tie, would  you do it?  I said absolutely, not thinking that we were going to end up in a tie when you say yes,\" Schwarber said about being chosen for the swing-off. \"And then as the game's going, you're  looking at the score, you're not really thinking the game's going to end  in a tie.\"  </p>\n        \n\n<p>As Schwarber noted, the swing-off players are selected a day in advance. The rules are laid out clearly in the collective bargaining agreement. Article XV(N)(4)(a) explains how players are selected:  </p><blockquote><p>(a) Following announcement of the All-Star Game rosters, the Association, the Office of the Commissioner, and the manager of each League's All-Star Team shall work together to encourage player participation in the tiebreaker and solicit player interest in participating. In the event that the parties have not identified at least three (3) players from each League's active roster who have agreed to participate in the tiebreaker by the Saturday prior to the All-Star Game, the Association and the Commissioner's Office shall meet and confer and use best efforts to secure the requisite number of participants. Thereafter, the manager of each League's All-Star team shall select (i) three (3) players on his team's active roster who have agreed to participate in the All-Star tiebreaker (\"tiebreaker selections\"), if applicable; (ii) one (1) alternate player from his active roster who has agreed to participate in the All-Star tiebreaker, if necessary due to injury to a tiebreaker selection; (iii) an All-Star team coach who will throw batting practice during the All-Star tiebreaker; and (iv) an All-Star team bullpen catcher who will catch during the All-Star tiebreaker. \t \t</p></blockquote><p>In English, that means each team selects three players and one alternate in case of injury in advance, and the players must agree to participate. The manager can't simply tap a guy on the shoulder and say \"go hit.\" On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3152105/kyle-stowers/\">Kyle Stowers</a> was used as the injury replacement for <span>Eugenio Suárez</span>, who took a pitch to the hand in the eighth inning. (X-rays were negative and Suárez is fine.)  </p><p>\"Eugenio got hit in the hand.  So I had to replace him with my starfish,  Kyle Stowers.  That's his new nickname, starfish,\" Roberts explained. \"So had to replace  him.\"  </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-hits-home-run-with-all-star-game-swing-off-in-exhilarating-midsummer-classic/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>MLB hits home run with All-Star Game swing-off in exhilarating Midsummer Classic</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Snyder                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"MLB hits home run with All-Star Game swing-off in exhilarating Midsummer Classic\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/16/4aa50452-88a4-411b-bb1d-a9eea3feca63/thumbnail/270x152/1d8c53547cce678c180445def588981a/asg-getty-2.png\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Stowers, Schwarber, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2447476/pete-alonso/\">Pete Alonso</a> hit for the NL in that order, though Alonso wasn't needed. The AL sent <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837434/brent-rooker/\">Brent Rooker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2914723/randy-arozarena/\">Randy Arozarena</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821278/jonathan-aranda/\">Jonathan Aranda</a> to hit in that order. Aranda went 0 for 3 with the AL down 4-3, ending the swing-off. Capable home run hitters, all of them, but the question has to asked: Where were <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/\">Cal Raleigh</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2901324/shohei-ohtani/\">Shohei Ohtani</a>?  </p>\n        \n\n<p>There is a good answer to this. First and foremost, Judge and Ohtani were gone by time the swing-off took place. It is common for All-Star starting position players, particularly veterans with multiple ASGs under their belt, to leave the ballpark early so they can enjoy the rest of their All-Star break. Judge did his postgame media session in street clothes long before the swing-off.  </p>\n<p>\"Shohei was long gone,\" Roberts said when asked why Ohtani didn't hit in the tiebreaker. \"But I think what it was is you had to declare  three guys with one alternate before the game.  And so we went around  and sort of polled the guys and figured out who was going to be in the  back half of the game, kind of thing like that.\"  </p><p>Raleigh, the MLB leader with 38 home runs, started the All-Star Game and was removed in the middle of the sixth inning. He did stay until the end of the All-Star Game though. He was in full uniform as he stood in front of the dugout during the swing-off, yet he was only an interested observer, not a participant.  </p>\n        \n\n<p>In Raleigh's case, he was out of the game for about 90 minutes before the swing-off. Asking him to get hot again and go hit in the tiebreaker is an unnecessary injury risk. The All-Star Game is an exhibition and, above all, it is each manager's duty to make sure no one gets hurt. Sending Raleigh back up there after an hour and a half of inactivity is asking for him to pull an oblique.  </p><p>Perhaps it's fair to criticize <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> manager Aaron Boone, the losing manager, for his swing-off picks even while acknowledging Judge, Raleigh, and other starters were unavailable for one reason to another. After all, Aranda has 11 home runs this season, not exactly a gaudy total. The players do have to agree to the swing-off, remember, and it's possible some guys just declined.&nbsp;  </p><p>One star AL player, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117472/bobby-witt-jr/\">Bobby Witt Jr.</a>, was ready to go for the swing-off though, but wasn't asked to participate.  </p>\n        \n\n\n<p>A miscalculation on Boone's part, seemingly. That said, the AL didn't have many true power hitters in their lineup by the end of the night. Among players in the game at the time, Boone's alternatives to Aranda were Witt and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2000026/byron-buxton/\">Byron Buxton</a>, then non-power hitters like <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932861/steven-kwan/\">Steven Kwan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2829027/maikel-garcia/\">Maikel Garcia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2794938/zach-mckinstry/\">Zach McKinstry</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2875260/alejandro-kirk/\">Alejandro Kirk</a>. Aranda was as good a bet as any of those guys.  </p><p>In the end, the game's top power hitters -- Judge, Ohtani, Raleigh, etc. -- did not participate in the swing-off either because they simply were no longer at the ballpark or because they had been out of the game and cooled down for a long period of time. Boone almost certainly does not think Aranda is a better home run hitter than Judge. There were still plenty of great hitters available to hit on both sides. The NL just happened to get best of the AL in the swing-off.  </p><p>\"I think it's a good idea, just for the fact of we're not hopefully putting more people at any other kind of risk. We're not playing more innings, things like that,\" Schwarber said about the swing-off. \"... But yeah, when that happens, you're more thinking, one, it's really probably  not going to happen.  Then it does happen.  Just excited that it was  able to work out for us.\"  </p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Christmas starts in July, is four weeks long and comes with a present nearly every single day: That your favorite third-string receiver made a tough snag over the middle in double coverage; that the undersized, small-school undrafted pass rusher is once again terrorizing the backup offensive line; that everybody -- and I mean <i>everybody</i> -- is in the best shape of his life.</p><p>It's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> training camp, folks. And it's right around the corner, with veteran players for the Chargers and Lions reporting to camp later this week, ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44816997/chargers-lions-meet-2025-pro-football-hall-fame-game\">Hall of Fame Game</a> on July 31.</p><p>There's little I look forward to more than the first video to hit my timeline of a few star players jogging out onto the practice field. Perhaps the only thing I cherish more are answers to the following questions, winners of the following positional battles, health for the following injuries and updates on the following rookies. Let's get into it.</p><p><strong>Jump to:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45717323/2025-nfl-season-training-camp-storylines-quarterbacks-rookies-injuries#questions\">Questions</a> | <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45717323/2025-nfl-season-training-camp-storylines-quarterbacks-rookies-injuries#battles\">Battles</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45717323/2025-nfl-season-training-camp-storylines-quarterbacks-rookies-injuries#injuries\">Injuries</a> | <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45717323/2025-nfl-season-training-camp-storylines-quarterbacks-rookies-injuries#rookies\">Rookies</a></p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Five unanswered questions that could be answered</h2><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/det.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What will the second act of Dan Campbell look like?</h2><p>Campbell is one of the best coaches in the league. There is no question about this, none at all. Two of his best acts with the Lions have been as follows: hiring Aaron Glenn as defensive coordinator, and promoting Ben Johnson to offensive coordinator after his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30766148/sources-lions-hire-ex-chargers-coach-anthony-lynn-offensive-coordinator\">first hiring</a> (Anthony Lynn) <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33036043/anthony-lynn-detroit-lions-offensive-coordinator\">didn't work out</a>.</p><p>Those are the only moves Campbell has needed to make at coordinator over his four years in Detroit -- a rare thing for a team as successful as the Lions have been. After years of interest, both Glenn and Johnson have finally taken head coaching jobs elsewhere, which raises a few questions. The first: Just how good is Campbell's eye for coaching talent? New DC Kelvin Sheppard was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43562932/lions-promote-lbs-coach-kelvin-sheppard-dc\">promoted</a> from the linebackers coaching job, but Campbell first worked with him back in 2014-15, when Sheppard was still a player on the Dolphins. He's been the defensive coordinator-in-waiting for a while now. What does Campbell see in him? And will that vision be realized?</p><p>On the offensive side of the ball, where plenty of candidates for internal promotion were available (Hank Fraley, Tanner Engstrand, Antwan Randel El), Campbell went for an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43598107/lions-working-hire-broncos-john-morton-oc-sources-say\">external hire</a> in John Morton. There is some familiarity there, as Morton spent the 2022 season as the Lions' senior offensive assistant. Does he have a particularly strong relationship with <a data-player-guid=\"987f4f39-ed6f-5915-57eb-ec7dc356171c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>, who will need to shoulder a greater load now that Johnson has left the building? Can Morton bring the same creativity, the same situational excellence that powered the Lions' fourth-down approach of seasons past?</p><p>The Lions are transitioning from a rebuilt upstart to a bona fide force, and that means they must combat brain drain. This is Campbell's first crack at replacing key staff departures, and getting it right is critical to completing the total team turnaround.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What does <a data-player-guid=\"7e9fbd60-951e-2d9a-8d8c-b3f1ab6c4a4d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a> do with this (last) chance?</h2><p>When Fields <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39747346/sources-bears-trading-qb-justin-fields-steelers\">finally got out</a> of Chicago last season, I was thrilled for him. Few franchises have been worse at QB development over the past several seasons than the Bears. The Steelers are another such candidate, as they have struggled to modernize their offensive approach or flood their roster with pass catchers for a young quarterback. Of course, Fields joined Pittsburgh as a backup behind <a data-player-guid=\"f0610946-ceb6-9a99-3bcc-cf110b2078b5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>, and he started only six games while Wilson recovered from a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41853236/steelers-russell-wilson-preparing-get-ready-go-vs-jets\">calf injury</a>.</p><p>Rather surprisingly, the Jets gave him a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44194622/jets-reach-2-year-40m-deal-qb-justin-fields-sources-say\">starter's deal</a> and an unimpeded path to the QB1 job. The Jets are another candidate for our \"even worse than the Bears at quarterback development\" list, but it's a new staff in New York -- namely, head coach Aaron Glenn and offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand. Both came from Detroit, and Glenn in particular watched his defenses get ravaged by Fields' legs twice a season. Fields' last three games as a Bear against Glenn's defense: 12 carries for 58 yards and a touchdown; 10 carries for 132 yards; 13 carries for 147 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>Now, the Jets have few pass catchers behind <a data-player-guid=\"da106063-995d-eaf0-54e4-ccecd5e90767\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson\">Garrett Wilson</a>, but they have a pretty solid offensive line. I don't think they'll tip their hand (and put Fields in harm's way) too much during training camp, but I'll be watching the reports closely. And I won't be surprised if we see a 2022-like season for Fields. Back then, he posted 160 carries for 1,143 yards, the second most <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35361863/bears-cite-experience-keeping-justin-fields-lopsided-loss\">all time</a> for a quarterback. If he can replicate that season with his legs, while getting more passing game help from Engstrand and Wilson than he ever got in Chicago, there just might be something there.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/min.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What is <a data-player-guid=\"460fbf74-c64d-3862-b942-852d104e94dd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4433970/jj-mccarthy\">J.J. McCarthy</a> ready for?</h2><p>There isn't a training camp question with a bigger range of outcomes than the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45523859/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-quarterback\">McCarthy question</a> in Minnesota. I can draw two parallel universes for you. In the first, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45375201/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-justin-jefferson\">a year of rehab</a> gave McCarthy the opportunity to prepare mentally, and he is accordingly as sharp as a tack under center -- no rookie mistakes. Fully <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44919491/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-nfl-draft\">physically recovered</a>, he offers more on the boot than Darnold ever did, creating a new layer in the already dangerous Vikings offense. Minnesota hits the ground <i>running</i>.</p><p>In the other, Minnesota really does hit the ground running because McCarthy isn't ready. He is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44921044/qb-jj-mccarthy-know-ready-start-vikings\">uncertain on the knee</a> and still adjusting to NFL speed, and it's not like he was a pass-heavy maven in college either. The Vikings heavily rely on a retooled offensive line, as well as a running back by committee with <a data-player-guid=\"ca688cbe-b781-01a6-69f2-eb87420aec83\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360569/jordan-mason\">Jordan Mason</a> joining <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042519/aaron-jones-sr\">Aaron Jones</a>.

McCarthy and the Minnesota Vikings.</p></div></div><p>These two worlds, and every world in between, feel possible for the Vikings. We shouldn't overreact to anything we get in training camp, especially negative. The McCarthy we get in August won't be the McCarthy we see in December, as a season's worth of NFL action teaches some big lessons. But the Vikings are in a competitive division and harbor deep playoff aspirations. They only have so much leash to give a rookie, especially when you consider how easily Kevin O'Connell has made veteran quarterbacks shine in this offense. McCarthy's health and confidence are about as big of a July storyline as you get in the NFL.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/cin.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What happens with <a data-player-guid=\"7ab1c7ee-fd75-435d-b0c5-613879216083\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052743/trey-hendrickson\">Trey Hendrickson</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"ee8dca16-7ec4-3fa6-8c10-6cc028cd1802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685562/shemar-stewart\">Shemar Stewart</a>?</h2><p>I remain confident that the two most obvious things will happen in Cincinnati: The Bengals will <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45362772/nfl-bengals-trey-hendrickson-contract-holdout\">reach an extension</a> with Hendrickson that makes him a top-three highest-paid defensive player in football, and they will give Stewart the rookie contract language <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45498593/source-shemar-stewart-leaves-bengals-minicamp-amid-contract-dispute\">he seeks</a> so he can start practicing.</p><p>However, there's a not-insubstantial (excellent writing there; I'm a professional) chance at least one of these takes a left turn. Hendrickson seems to have more internal locker room support for a prolonged holdout than any other player I can remember. Everyone in a Bengals uniform knows he has carried that defense for a long time, and in no season was that more obvious than last year. If Hendrickson flatly rejects every offer the Bengals give him and tries to reinvigorate trade markets as other teams reevaluate their rosters during training camp, I will be surprised. But not shocked.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45500644/nfl-bengals-shemar-stewart-contract-holdout-trade-college\">Stewart situation</a> feels tied to the Hendrickson situation. If Hendrickson is holding out (or holding in, as that's the method these days), then the Bengals will swiftly revert their rookie contract language and get Stewart practicing -- they need him even more than they thought. But what if the Hendrickson deal gets done before camp? I can see the Bengals \"losing\" the Hendrickson negotiation (i.e., paying him a bajillion dollars), and digging their heels in on the Stewart contract as a result.</p><p>Again: I still strongly believe we're going to get the expected outcome on both of these deals, but I'm not counting my chickens just yet.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/hou.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/tb.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>Can Nick Caley get it going? And can Josh Grizzard keep it going?</h2><p>With every offseason, it feels like new offensive coordinators have bigger and bigger leverage in surprising team outcomes. Compare the 2024 Eagles to the 2023 Eagles if you don't believe me -- a playcaller can just as easily tank a humming offense as he can resurrect a fallen one.</p><p>In the latter case this season, we have <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43680408/texans-hiring-rams-nick-caley-new-oc-source-says\">new Texans offensive coordinator</a> Nick Caley, who inherits a Texans offense that fell from lofty expectations in 2024. Houston's approach to pass protection proved far too rudimentary, and opposing defenses easily found pressure schematically. They found it against personnel as well, so the Texans retooled their offensive line accordingly.</p><p>It's easy to poke holes in the 2025 Texans' offensive personnel. Rookie receivers fill the depth chart behind <a data-player-guid=\"338aa0be-bd63-1a24-1929-796af121cefb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4258173/nico-collins\">Nico Collins</a>. <a data-player-guid=\"0c22d637-c0d7-6bac-7333-dc3a992bdc0d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895856/christian-kirk\">Christian Kirk</a> is returning from a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42042587/sources-jaguars-wr-christian-kirk-broken-collarbone\">collarbone injury</a>; <a data-player-guid=\"dd36357c-436b-f059-d957-ddbb12cf33ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4366031/tank-dell\">Tank Dell</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44125809/texans-wr-tank-dell-undergoes-another-surgery-knee\">might not be back</a> this season at all. The offensive line is young and shuffled. But I remember how explosive this offense was in 2023 when the playcalling was sharp, and the core of that success -- <a data-player-guid=\"147e6862-2ac0-3a97-8f36-e3b1c0147320\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432577/cj-stroud\">C.J. Stroud</a> and Collins -- remains. I'm bullish on a Texans offensive bounce-back, so long as Caley is as billed.</p><p>On the other hand, Josh Grizzard isn't looking to rebound, but sustain. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43796736/tampa-bay-buccaneers-offensive-coordinator-josh-grizzard-wizard\">new offensive coordinator</a> in Tampa Bay, Grizzard steps into Liam Coen's shoes as the playcaller for <a data-player-guid=\"5bb4376a-d089-e3e4-e49a-44f1d709a012\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield</a> and a Bucs offense that returns every single starter from last season (and adds <a data-player-guid=\"48fb595b-ecda-3de2-9c05-fcc8090c4b84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567750/emeka-egbuka\">Emeka Egbuka</a>, a first-round wide receiver from Ohio State). But Grizzard has never called plays before, and he was a fast riser through the Dolphins' offensive ranks before his one season as the Buccaneers' passing game coordinator last season. What's his DNA?</p><p>The Bucs were one bounce away from a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401671883\">wild-card win</a> over the Commanders last season, and that was with an injury-riddled defense. If they are healthier on that side of the ball, they look like a bona fide NFC contender ... so long as you assume the offense doesn't take a step back with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43551022/tampa-bay-buccaneers-liam-coen-jacksonville-jaguars-head-coach-happened\">Coen's departure</a>.

Richardson initially injured his throwing shoulder in 2023 on a scramble and aggravated that AC joint during practice in May. Coach Shane Steichen put no timetable on a return, but reports indicate he'll be ready for training camp.</p><p>If Richardson can throw unimpeded during training camp, we have ourselves a real battle. Jones, who signed a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44206117/qb-daniel-jones-finalizing-1-year-deal-colts-sources-say\">one-year deal</a> in March, is a known commodity -- a low-end starting quarterback with some rushing ability but little arm talent to elevate a passing game. Richardson, who has missed 17 games with injuries in his first two seasons, still has the requisite physical talent to not just win the starting job but also become a highly dangerous NFL QB.

On paper, he is the most talented wide receiver in New England. But he's 31 years old, coming off an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42074896/texans-wr-stefon-diggs-season-torn-acl\">ACL tear</a> and has already enjoyed some <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45487425/patriots-stefon-diggs-deflects-personal-boat-video-questions\">off-field shenanigans</a> this offseason.

Among 27 players who ran at least 60% of their routes from the slot last season, he ranked 17th in yards per route run and 19th in first downs per target. That's not prolific enough to have a stranglehold on that role, and any smart usage of Diggs includes a decent diet of slot routes.

It's unreasonable to expect the same from Campbell, of course, but the staff has proven their ability to handle a rookie's limited onboarding.</p><hr><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/dal.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><h2><a data-player-guid=\"64944dd8-160f-0726-2b9d-4e82e22db36e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362088/demarvion-overshown\">DeMarvion Overshown</a>, LB, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b0fc8fb7-9dbe-e574-9008-6f0ee7c6b234\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a></h2><p>One of the breakout stars of the 2024 season, Overshown started 12 games and collected 90 tackles along with five sacks, three pass breakups, an interception and a forced fumble. Then, in Week 14, he <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42893482/jerry-jones-demarvion-overshown-right-knee-surgery\">tore the ACL, PCL and MCL</a> in his right knee -- less than two years after an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38229440/source-cowboys-lb-demarvion-overshown-torn-acl\">ACL tear</a> in his left knee robbed him of his rookie season.</p><p>Overshown should be one of two starting linebackers under new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, but when exactly he gets back on the field is something to monitor. He gave a bullish update on his health to the <a href=\"https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/demarvion-overshown-on-injury-rehab-learning-from-matt-eberflus-more\">Cowboys team site</a> in May: \"I think it really couldn't be any better. If it was better, I'd probably be out there playing right now. Where I'm at in my rehab, in my process, it's where I'm supposed to be plus some.\"</p><p>That sounds rosy, but expect the Cowboys to be cautious with Overshown (as one should be with a player who tore three ligaments in one knee). Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said in April the team does not expect Overshown to start the season, and local reporters have tagged November as a likely window to return. I'd be stunned if we see him do much during camp, but if he really is ahead on his rehab, we could see the rumblings in August of an early return to action.</p><hr><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567962/jermaine-johnson\">Jermaine Johnson</a>, Edge, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"732d3caf-b350-1e34-48c6-b7cebb4a0d88\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a></h2><p>Johnson played his way into the Pro Bowl with a breakout 2023 season, and expectations were sky high for 2024.

Because of the scheme switch from Robert Saleh to Glenn, it's important that Johnson gets at least some time to knock the rust off in August.</p><p>Athletes returning from Achilles tears can also struggle for months to reclaim their old explosiveness. To accurately gauge how he might impact the game in September, if and when he's back in Week 1, it's important to get a good look at him on the move during camp.</p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"><h2>Five rookies to watch</h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/lar.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><h2><a data-player-guid=\"897a7b37-1f13-3f52-b2ed-a45faef85eb1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4570037/terrance-ferguson\">Terrance Ferguson</a>, TE, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2e1473b2-e269-fd7a-1137-c1edacb85986\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Los Angeles Rams</a></h2><p>Let's connect some dots.

Even if they took a generational center with their top pick, there would still be concerns about losing a franchise cornerstone like that. But the position is now doubly tenuous with Ratledge as the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45459583/detroit-lions-offensive-line-frank-ragnow\">expected replacement</a>.</p><p>A high school tackle who played guard at Georgia, Ratledge only ever practiced at center in college -- he never saw game action there.

We can say that in Bengals-Browns, where Cincy is a 5.5-point favorite. Arizona is a similar favorite in Cardinals-Saints.</p><p>Steelers-Jets is nowhere near that level of mismatch for me, even granting that the spread is a few points lower. I'm not even sure the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> are the better team after the two squads swapped quarterbacks, as it seems like both franchises would've preferred to have <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1273205/justin-fields/\">Justin Fields</a> under center. The Steelers have an elite defense, but so did the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> prior to last year, and a lot of those players remain on the roster and are getting a fresh start after the tumult of the last two years.</p><p>The one place the Steelers have a major advantage is in coaching, as Mike Tomlin is a perennial winner while Aaron Glenn is in the lead position for the first time. But that doesn't negate the fact that the Jets have more collective talent, which I think the market hasn't realized, or home-field advantage. I wouldn't be surprised if this got bet down to around pick 'em.</p><h2>Vikings at Bears pick</h2><sportsline-pick-snippet data-cbssports-betting-component=\"1\" data-shortcode=\"picksnippet\" data-uuid=\"34930421-e909-4f8c-bff0-24e0adc0ca9b\" data-oracle-id=\"29724652\" data-team=\"3b556893-7f94-4730-9c10-759894681816\" data-home-team=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3b556893-7f94-4730-9c10-759894681816&quot;,&quot;oracleId&quot;:409,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Chicago&quot;,&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;f78d1add-8410-4fb5-849a-17eb53d0406e&quot;,&quot;mediumName&quot;:&quot;Chicago&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Bears&quot;,&quot;teamAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;CHI&quot;,&quot;teamShortLabel&quot;:&quot;Chicago Bears (CHI)&quot;,&quot;teamPrimaryColor&quot;:&quot;0B162A&quot;}\" data-away-team=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;c7fd05cb-e39f-4cc2-a6da-386fc822f874&quot;,&quot;oracleId&quot;:419,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Minnesota&quot;,&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;3245ab49-b0e5-462d-8c7b-52ff2543d6f8&quot;,&quot;mediumName&quot;:&quot;Minnesota&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Vikings&quot;,&quot;teamAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;MIN&quot;,&quot;teamShortLabel&quot;:&quot;Minnesota Vikings (MIN)&quot;,&quot;teamPrimaryColor&quot;:&quot;4F2683&quot;}\" data-game-abbreviation=\"NFL_20250908_MIN@CHI\" data-game-date=\"{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-09-09 00:15:00.000000&quot;,&quot;timezone_type&quot;:3,&quot;timezone&quot;:&quot;UTC&quot;}\" data-league=\"003dddb8-4fbd-4b9a-814c-29cc9a8703a7\" data-market-data=\"[{&quot;title&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Standard Market | Spread&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:1,&quot;object&quot;:false,&quot;metadata&quot;:false}]\" data-pick=\"{&quot;marketType&quot;:&quot;standard&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;spread&quot;,&quot;marketId&quot;:1,&quot;marketName&quot;:&quot;Spread&quot;,&quot;gameId&quot;:29724652,&quot;vendorMarketId&quot;:&quot;sr:market:223&quot;,&quot;vendorGameId&quot;:&quot;fbfcee5c-907c-4a1e-a6ab-82adcd624399&quot;,&quot;selectionId&quot;:null,&quot;teamId&quot;:409,&quot;teamAbbr&quot;:&quot;CHI&quot;,&quot;pick&quot;:&quot;home&quot;,&quot;odds&quot;:-104,&quot;line&quot;:-1.5,&quot;book&quot;:31,&quot;bookName&quot;:&quot;Consensus&quot;}\" data-pick-field-data=\"[{&quot;title&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;CHI -1.5 -104&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gameId=29724652;marketId=1;marketType=standard;book=31;client=sl;pick=home&quot;,&quot;object&quot;:false,&quot;metadata&quot;:false}]\">\n    \n    </sportsline-pick-snippet>\n\n\n\n    \n<p>This one is a bit more speculative on my part and involves what I expect the narrative to be come August. There should be a lot of excitement around the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a> with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/395994/ben-johnson/\">Ben Johnson</a> taking over as head coach, and any positive news we see out of camp and joint practice about the offense will push expectations even higher. People will also be reassured when optimism bleeds through about the rebuilt offensive line as well as any buzz around the team's top two picks, both of whom boost an impressive stable of pass-catchers.</p><p>The Vikings have their own rebuilt offensive line that could lead to optimism, but I think everyone's attention will be focused on how <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695214/j-j-mccarthy/\">J.J. McCarthy</a> looks running the offense. Last year, the market pegged the Vikings as a 6.5-win team heading into the season with the expectation McCarthy would start, and coming off a major injury that cost him the entire season, I don't see why things should be much different this year, especially not just because <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a> had a huge season in this offseason.</p><p>This line is a soft -1.5 right now, which would normally indicate it's heading the other way toward pick 'em. But I see the Bears as being a preseason darling that will eventually take action in the market and push this one the other way up towards -3.</p><h2>Raiders at Patriots pick</h2><sportsline-pick-snippet data-cbssports-betting-component=\"1\" data-shortcode=\"picksnippet\" data-uuid=\"a6f91bf0-c813-42d0-a5be-e6cdb602c1e0\" data-oracle-id=\"29724634\" data-team=\"36c0e77e-e118-47b8-b230-077616c89dd0\" data-home-team=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1a3310ba-c4e8-45f3-9090-118d7f16a693&quot;,&quot;oracleId&quot;:420,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;New England&quot;,&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;3ba0dce3-0656-497f-b39d-7be2964aafd8&quot;,&quot;mediumName&quot;:&quot;New England&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Patriots&quot;,&quot;teamAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;NE&quot;,&quot;teamShortLabel&quot;:&quot;New England Patriots (NE)&quot;,&quot;teamPrimaryColor&quot;:&quot;002244&quot;}\" data-away-team=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;36c0e77e-e118-47b8-b230-077616c89dd0&quot;,&quot;oracleId&quot;:424,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Las Vegas&quot;,&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;79609230-46d5-11ea-93dd-0a64accfd4a9&quot;,&quot;mediumName&quot;:&quot;Las Vegas&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Raiders&quot;,&quot;teamAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;LV&quot;,&quot;teamShortLabel&quot;:&quot;Las Vegas Raiders (LV)&quot;,&quot;teamPrimaryColor&quot;:&quot;A5ACAF&quot;}\" data-game-abbreviation=\"NFL_20250907_LV@NE\" data-game-date=\"{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-09-07 17:00:00.000000&quot;,&quot;timezone_type&quot;:3,&quot;timezone&quot;:&quot;UTC&quot;}\" data-league=\"003dddb8-4fbd-4b9a-814c-29cc9a8703a7\" data-market-type=\"standard\" data-market-data=\"[]\" data-pick=\"{&quot;marketType&quot;:&quot;standard&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;spread&quot;,&quot;marketId&quot;:1,&quot;marketName&quot;:&quot;Spread&quot;,&quot;gameId&quot;:29724634,&quot;vendorMarketId&quot;:&quot;sr:market:223&quot;,&quot;vendorGameId&quot;:&quot;ea3242f9-4081-413f-8bd9-a455f34c4934&quot;,&quot;selectionId&quot;:null,&quot;teamId&quot;:424,&quot;teamAbbr&quot;:&quot;LV&quot;,&quot;pick&quot;:&quot;away&quot;,&quot;odds&quot;:-115,&quot;line&quot;:3,&quot;book&quot;:31,&quot;bookName&quot;:&quot;Consensus&quot;}\" data-pick-field-data=\"[{&quot;title&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Spread LV +3 -115&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;gameId=29724634;marketId=1;marketType=standard;book=31;client=sl;pick=away&quot;,&quot;object&quot;:false,&quot;metadata&quot;:false}]\">\n    \n    </sportsline-pick-snippet>\n\n\n\n    \n<p>The futures market has been aggressively optimistic so far with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a>.

Upon reaching that area, another security guard stopped them and claimed they needed to show credentials to exit, at which point they presented the proper credentials.</p><p>Despite displaying their credentials and others with the same credentials being allowed to pass through, the security guard began arguing with the Johnsons, rejecting explanations about the difference in parking lots as well as requests to contact his supervisor. The confrontation eventually resulted in the security guard shoving Johnson in the chest, causing his wheelchair to flip over and his head to hit the concrete, causing him to lose consciousness for approximately 15 seconds.</p><p>Johnson was taken to Sonoma's infield care center before being transported to a Santa Rosa hospital, where he remained until early Monday morning. The security guard, identified as 27-year old Alexander Rosiles, was arrested at approximately 3 p.m. local time following the incident and charged with assault and battery. Rosiles, who appeared before Sonoma County Superior Court on Tuesday, is in custody on a $35,000 bail and has been accused by prosecutors of being in violation of the terms of a previous assault conviction.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Johnson, a native of Penngrove, California, was an accomplished sprint car racer prior to his life-altering accident during last year's Gold Cup Race of Champions at Silver Dollar Speedway.

Soon enough, we'll be in the thick of the preseason, and the 2025 regular season will be here before we know it. Then it's a mad dash that will only end when we get to Santa Clara, California, for <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> LX.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, loads will happen between now and then that we won't see coming. However, there are some moves that went down this offseason that we know will have some sort of impact on the regular season. And that's what we'll be identifying for our exercise today.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we're going to scan through all of the major moves that happened throughout the offseason and rank them on how they may impact the upcoming year. These moves will range from simple player acquisition, players departing one organization for another, key stars being retained, a team choosing to keep one player over another, and coaching hires.&nbsp;</p><h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a> trading <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071515/jalen-ramsey/\">Jalen Ramsey</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2081506/jonnu-smith/\">Jonnu Smith</a></h2>\n<p>Even before trading away Ramsey and Smith to the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, the Miami Dolphins were looked at as a team possibly facing a downturn in 2025. Their win total for the year is hovering around 8.5 and 7.5 with the action juiced to the Under on 8.5, meaning they are expected to be an under .500 club yet again in 2025. This trade only made Miami worse, and it came at a point in the offseason when there were no viable replacements to bring in.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>While the situation with Ramsey devolved to a point of no return, the Dolphins didn't exactly prepare for a departure that most folks saw coming miles away. Ramsey may have had a down year by his standards in 2024, but he still allowed just an 83.2 passer rating when targeted by opposing quarterbacks and broke up 11 passes. In his absence, the Dolphins are currently set to lean on a cornerback room headlined by <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122721/storm-duck/\">Storm Duck</a> (2024 undrafted free agent), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3131626/cam-smith/\">Cam Smith</a> (played six games in 2024 due to injury), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071570/artie-burns/\">Artie Burns</a> (played four games in 2024 due to injury), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26702648/jason-marshall-jr/\">Jason Marshall Jr</a>. (a fifth-round rookie), and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28867686/kader-kohou/\">Kader Kohou</a> (primarily a nickel corner).&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dolphins seemed to unlock Jonnu Smith midway through last season, and the tight end fit well within Mike McDaniel's offense. Smith led the team in receptions and receiving touchdowns, while logging a career-high 884 yards receiving. Why move on from a player like that? And the replacement is set to be <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1850793/darren-waller/\">Darren Waller</a>, who was <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/darren-waller-trade-grades-dolphins-make-unexpected-gamble-to-replace-jonnu-smith-as-giants-unload-veteran-te/\" target=\"_blank\">retired at this point last year</a></span>? Trading away a No. 1 corner and one of your top pass catchers may only further push Miami down the standings and make the seat under McDaniel tremendously hot.&nbsp;</p><h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> trading up for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a>&nbsp;in the 2025 <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a></h2>\n<p>After selecting pass rusher <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28890311/abdul-carter/\">Abdul Carter</a> with the third overall pick, the New York Giants traded back up into the first round to select Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart.

Stroud</a> or Jayden Daniel-type rookie season from Dart, his arrival to the Big Apple is primed to shake up the organization in some way, shape or form. The club has been adamant that <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a>, who signed with the Giants in free agency, will be the Week 1 starter. However, it does seem like it'll only be a matter of time before Dart leaps over him. Already during offseason workouts, Dart <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/giants-rookie-qb-jaxson-dart-looks-impressive-working-with-first-and-second-teams-in-minicamp/\" target=\"_blank\">worked with the first and second team offense</a></span>, so he seemed to be vying for playing time earlier than expected.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Dart's eventual ascent could prove to be the last gasp of Wilson's <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> career, which shouldn't be overlooked. On top of that, his success if/when he does line up under center could very well determine the fate of the entire Giants masthead. If Brian Daboll pulls that lever and makes Dart QB1 and it fails, he is as good as fired along with general manager Joe Schoen. If he shows some promise and New York is at least respectable, that could result in both Daboll and Shoen keeping their jobs, and suddenly the Giants have an arrow that's not pointing towards the depths of the NFL.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2025-nfl-head-coach-hot-seat-rankings-these-coaches-must-deliver-successful-seasons-or-risk-getting-fired/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>2025 NFL head coach hot seat rankings: These coaches must deliver successful seasons -- or risk getting fired</p>\n                <p>\n                    Tyler Sullivan                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 NFL head coach hot seat rankings: These coaches must deliver successful seasons -- or risk getting fired\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/06/26/bf98373e-0c4b-4a26-bb00-49da1fa91243/thumbnail/270x152/270902205f147f8ed7dc899c27e0f773/brian-daboll.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> re-signing <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2005667/ronnie-stanley/\">Ronnie Stanley</a>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>It cannot be overstated how important it was for the Baltimore Ravens to retain Ronnie Stanley. He was unquestionably the top left tackle on the market, and it appeared for a minute that he'd depart Baltimore for the highest bidder. Instead, he decided to ink a three-year, $60 million contract just a day before the legal tampering window opened. By keeping Stanley in-house, the Ravens solidified that <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> will continue to have elite protection on the blindside. And for a team that is in the thick of its <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> window, it's a monumental signing.&nbsp;</p><p>Had he decided to truly enter the market and leave, there wasn't much out there in free agency for Baltimore to replace him with. The next-best tackle was arguably <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871346/dan-moore-jr/\">Dan Moore Jr.</a>, who gave up 12 sacks with the Pittsburgh Steelers last season. If they opted to find his replacement at the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>, that brings its own set of question marks. Keeping Jackson upright is the most important thing for Baltimore's Super Bowl hopes, and keeping Stanley helps do just that.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> hiring Mike Vrabel as head coach</h2><p>New England has endured what Robert Kraft called <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/robert-kraft-vows-turnaround-for-patriots-what-needs-to-happen-to-consider-2025-a-success-for-new-england/\" target=\"_blank\">\"the worst\"</a></span> two-year run of his ownership tenure, as the Patriots have gone 4-13 in each of the previous two seasons. However, there is promise for the organization to turn things around in 2025. The club addressed key needs along the roster in both free agency and at the NFL Draft, and seems to have found its building block at quarterback with rising sophomore <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695757/drake-maye/\">Drake Maye</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While all of that certainly will make New England a more talented outfit, the hiring of Mike Vrabel should be looked at as the biggest move of the franchise's offseason. His presence on the sideline and proven in-game coaching ability (something that was sorely lacking throughout last season) raise the floor of what the Patriots may be in 2025. On the betting markets, they are -235 to go over their 7.5 win total and are also favored to go over 8.5 at -120. If they do, that's more than doubling their win total from a season ago and, if they reach nine wins, it's more than they've had in the prior two years combined. Certainly, a piece of that optimism is due to the arrival of more talented players, but a chunk of it also belongs to stability at the head coach position in Vrabel.&nbsp;</p><h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a> trading <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a>, signing <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a></h2>\n<p>This game of quarterback musical chairs impacts three different organizations: the Seattle Seahawks, Las Vegas Raiders and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a>. First, Minnesota decided against retaining Darnold and opted to enter this coming season with former first-round pick <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695214/j-j-mccarthy/\">J.J. McCarthy</a>&nbsp;under center. With a return to the Vikings no longer an option for Darnold, he set his sights on the Seahawks, but Seattle first had to trade away starter Geno Smith to the Raiders. All three of these organizations will now have new starting quarterbacks. But how will it all shake out?&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>The Raiders are unquestionably better with Smith as their quarterback as opposed to the combination of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183083/gardner-minshew/\">Gardner Minshew</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2868716/aidan-oconnell/\">Aidan O'Connell</a> last year. For the Vikings, it makes sense to see what they have in McCarthy after investing a first-round pick in him a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the Seahawks, this is more of a risky endeavor. They certainly got younger with Darnold (28) over Smith (34), but will they get better quarterback play? Darnold turned back into a pumpkin at the tail end of last season with his Vikings unable to score double-digit points in Week 18 against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, nor during their one-and-done playoff appearance against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>. There's a scenario where Darnold was primarily the beneficiary of an outstanding situation in Minnesota and is primed to regress now that he's surrounded by a lesser cast, resulting in a $100 million miscue by Seattle.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> trading <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079900/laremy-tunsil/\">Laremy Tunsil</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a></h2>\n<p>The offensive line was a major issue for the Houston Texans last season. While the unit certainly needed fixing, trading away your best lineman wasn't exactly the way most folks thought they'd address it. The return for the star left tackle was substantial, but C.J. Stroud was sacked 52 times in 2024, and according to Pro Football Focus, Tunsil only accounted for two of those. He was hardly the problem, and if this revamped line struggles -- particularly whoever takes over at blindside tackle -- it could have major ramifications for Stroud taking another step forward in Year 3 and the Texans' overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Conversely, this was a major get for the Washington Commanders, who are coming off an appearance in the NFC Championship Game. They struck gold with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> and have now given their rising second-year quarterback a bona fide left tackle to protect him, which should only help his development. A team that was in the NFL's final four a season ago got notably better at one of the most important positions in the sport.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/predicting-nfl-all-pros-at-every-offensive-position-what-they-look-like-where-theyre-picked-and-whos-next/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Predicting NFL All-Pros at every offensive position: What they look like, where they're picked and who's next</p>\n                <p>\n                    Josh Edwards                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Predicting NFL All-Pros at every offensive position: What they look like, where they're picked and who's next\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/15/9fcca88d-1b28-4d7e-ada9-04e7d3ce8f4f/thumbnail/270x152/f65c44fa96840ef6deafa2a696eef354/jayden-daniels.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>4. Steelers signing <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a></h2>\n<p>No one moves the needle quite like Aaron Rodgers. He is now set to be the Pittsburgh Steelers starting quarterback after inking a one-year deal with the franchise for what may be his final season in the NFL. If we're talking about impact on the 2025 season, it's hard to argue putting this move any lower. Given where the Steelers were in the offseason at the time of Rodgers finally making his decision to sign, they were on the doorstep of possibly being forced to start <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131167/mason-rudolph/\">Mason Rudolph</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Had that scenario played out, we were looking at Mike Tomlin enduring his first under .500 season and the bottom completely falling out from under the Steelers. With Rodgers in-house, Pittsburgh can no longer be looked at as an easy out on a weekly basis and could prove to be competitive in the AFC playoff picture if the veteran quarterback still has some of his Hall of Fame talent in the tank. The investment in trading for and signing star wideout <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260185/dk-metcalf/\">DK Metcalf</a> earlier this offseason will also now bear fruit with Rodgers throwing him the football as opposed to Rudolph or rookie <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162310/will-howard/\">Will Howard</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> extending <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809208/tee-higgins/\">Tee Higgins</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139298/mike-gesicki/\">Mike Gesicki</a>&nbsp;while not prioritizing defense</h2>\n<p>The Bengals spent big this offseason, retaining some of their key figures on offense. Of course, signing <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966320/jamarr-chase/\">Ja'Marr Chase</a> to his earth-shattering $161 million contract extension was a no-brainer. But the Bengals also extended fellow receiver Tee Higgins to a four-year, $115 million deal and tight end Mike Gesicki to a three-year, $25.5 million contract.&nbsp;</p><p>In a vacuum, those deals are all well and good, as both Higgins and Gesicki have proven to be solid pieces for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a>. That said, keeping those figures in-house appears to have come at the cost of not improving the defensive side of the ball. The Bengals remain embattled in contract disputes with both <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bengals-in-contract-standoff-with-trey-hendrickson-breaking-down-where-things-stand-going-into-training-camp/\" target=\"_blank\">star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson</a></span> and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/back-to-school-back-to-the-draft-shemar-stewart-could-exploit-loophole-in-chaotic-rulebook-to-burn-bengals/\" target=\"_blank\">first-round edge rusher Shemar Stewart</a></span>. Specifically with Hendrickson, if that situation continues to devolve and lead to his departure, a Cincinnati defense that was already poor in 2024 will lose its best player, who just led the NFL with 17.5 sacks.</p><p>Instead of signing Higgins and/or Gesicki, there was a strong case to be made for Cincinnati to use that capital to bolster the defensive side of the ball, even if that meant taking a small step backwards offensively. After all, the Bengals had six losses when the offense scored 25 or more points last season, which tied an NFL record. They also had two losses when scoring 38 or more points (also tied for an NFL record).&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/395994/ben-johnson/\">Ben Johnson</a>&nbsp;and Aaron Glenn both leaving the Lions</h2><p>The Detroit Lions were the No. 1 seed in the NFC last season and will now look to replicate that success and push closer towards a Super Bowl run without their coordinators. Both Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn left the organization this offseason after being hired as head coaches by the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Chicago Bears</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>, respectively. While Detroit still has Dan Campbell at the helm as head coach and the vast majority of its core roster intact, their departures are a big variable, as they were each sensational on their respective sides of the ball.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news for the Lions is that in each of the previous four instances where a team retained its head coach but lost both coordinators to head coaching jobs in the same offseason, that club still made the playoffs the following season. While that's encouraging, it remains to be seen if Detroit will be better, the same or worse without Johnson and Glenn. If it's the latter, that'll have major ramifications in the NFC North race and the overall NFC playoff picture.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of the NFC North, Johnson decided to stay in the division with the Bears, who dramatically improved their roster this offseason. If he brings just baseline coaching to the organization, Chicago could be in the playoff hunt. As for Glenn, he takes over a Jets team that boasted one of the better defenses in the NFL, allowing just 5.0 yards per play in 2024 (tied for the second lowest in the NFL). If he can get serviceable play from his new quarterback&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1273205/justin-fields/\">Justin Fields</a>, the Jets might be frisky.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> staying in Los Angeles</h2>\n<p>To me, Matthew Stafford staying with the Los Angeles Rams after briefly flirting with a divorce was the most impactful move of the offseason. With Stafford, L.A. is in the Super Bowl conversation thanks to the continued presence of Sean McVay, along with an emerging defense. Without him, the Rams likely would've been forced to look at other options like <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1760229/jimmy-garoppolo/\">Jimmy Garoppolo</a>, Aaron Rodgers, or some draft prospect. Regardless of who would've been under center, Los Angeles would've been categorically worse and nowhere close to the Super Bowl ceiling it currently possesses.</p><p>Down the stretch, Stafford played like an MVP candidate for the Rams, leading them to a 7-2 record over his final nine games (including playoffs) while averaging 7.6 yards per attempt and throwing 15 touchdowns with just one interception. In the postseason, Los Angeles proved to be the only true threat to the eventual champion <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, nearly pulling off a last-second upset in the divisional round. There's no reason to expect him to slow down in 2025 outside of injury, making the Rams a legit threat to win Super Bowl LX.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

At this point, it's concerning that Las Vegas hasn't been able to shake off the rocky start, or figure out exactly what is causing the struggles.

Raleigh drew fairly close in late June, but the gap has since widened again. That's not Raleigh's fault; it's just Judge being Judge. At the time of our last Awards Watch, Judge had a 1.234 OPS. Since then, he has managed a meager 1.141. Yeah, that's still pretty good.</p><p>The shape of Judge's numbers has changed a bit. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45253929/2025-mlb-awards-watch-memorial-day-mvp-cy-young-judge-ohtani\">When we convened in late May</a>, he was hitting .395, and he has posted a mortal .297 average since. But he has picked things up in the slugging category. Last time, he was mashing homers at the rate of 54 per 162 games. Since, that number is 66. Raleigh might be having the greatest catcher season of all time, and it's possible that if there is any kind of Judge fatigue among the voters, that could impact the ballot. But what isn't likely is any kind of prolonged drop-off by Judge.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> Buxton wasn't in the top 10 last time out, but he has entered the top five based on several weeks of elite production and good health. During an 11-year career marked as much by injury as spectacular play, the first half featured Buxton at his best and most available, putting him on pace for his first 30/30 season at age 31. It keeps getting better: Since the last Awards Watch, Buxton has a 1.025 OPS with rates of 48 homers and 39 steals per 162 games.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Last time, there were two Red Sox in the top 10. Both have dropped out, with <a data-player-guid=\"b28542aa-30be-6851-75c4-501226976e1c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34886/alex-bregman\">Alex Bregman</a> hitting the IL and <a data-player-guid=\"9a29840a-6ec6-8b17-995a-f01bc7567f2d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33859/rafael-devers\">Rafael Devers</a> hitting the airport for a flight to join his new team in San Francisco. But Boston is still represented by the overlooked Rafaela. No, he isn't going to overtake Judge in the MVP race, but one of baseball's most unique players deserves a little run.</p><p>After splitting time between shortstop and center field in 2024, Rafaela has played almost exclusively on the grass this season, and his defensive metrics have been off the charts. That's driving this ranking, but Rafaela also has made tremendous strides at the plate. After entering the season with a career OPS+ of 83, he has upped that number to 118 in 2025 and is on pace for a 20/20 campaign.</p><hr><p><strong>National League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"04a76996-4a5c-456d-8022-a9d45e3ff933\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> (144 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2. <a data-player-guid=\"dcbeba5a-3fe9-3bf0-9f19-c077ef2a6f78\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4717833/pete-crow-armstrong\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a> (143); 3. <a data-player-guid=\"e2da449e-fe21-39e0-bd60-5b548dc4108b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35983/fernando-tatis-jr\">Fernando Tatis Jr.</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a> (136); 4. <a data-player-guid=\"b963b85d-6db2-f0e5-b763-88d4a41c0d73\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34967/kyle-tucker\">Kyle Tucker</a>, Cubs (135); 5. <a data-player-guid=\"05e514e4-4e08-31e8-a7bc-7aa82497d299\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4918256/james-wood\">James Wood</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals\">Washington Nationals</a> (134); 6. <a data-player-guid=\"7e560f9f-b486-f5f1-20a4-7699c1338287\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38309/will-smith\">Will Smith</a>, Dodgers (131); 7.

He has lurked behind Ohtani on the AXE leaderboard for most of the season, but a quiet series from Ohtani in Milwaukee paired with another outburst from Crow-Armstrong flipped the top spot. Ohtani is still the favorite -- the leaderboard flipped again over the weekend and, besides, he's Ohtani -- but at this point, we have to come to grips with the reality that Crow-Armstrong can mount a legitimate challenge.</p><p>Like Rafaela, Crow-Armstrong's defensive metrics are top of the charts and, in fact, those two are in a duel for the MLB lead in defensive runs saved metrics among outfielders. But Crow-Armstrong's bat continues to fuel his rise to superstar status. He entered the break on pace for 42 homers and 46 steals.</p><p>Ironically, if the offensive numbers between Ohtani and Crow-Armstrong are tight, it could come down to very different forms of run prevention. Crow-Armstrong is at 15 defensive runs saved as a center fielder. Meanwhile, Ohtani is at three runs above average during his nine innings on the mound. As the pitching side of Ohtani's record grows, that gap might narrow considerably.</p><p>If that happens and it comes down to a straight-up comparison at the plate, it's going to be tough for Crow-Armstrong, whose 140 OPS+ currently is dwarfed by Ohtani's 174.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> Wood continues to cement his arrival as a right-now star player, and his pace has been accelerating even after an excellent start. Despite a subdued week before the break, Wood has a .908 OPS and 162-game rates of 42 homers, 127 RBIs, 19 steals and 100 runs since the last Awards Watch. Overall, he has a .381 OBP and is on pace for 100 walks, so those numbers aren't driven by a short-term power surge. At 22, Wood simply is already an all-around offensive force.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Tucker overtook Crow-Armstrong for the No. 2 slot (and the Cubs' team lead) in AXE late in June, before Crow-Armstrong reasserted himself. But Tucker's production is metronomic: His AXE at the last Awards Watch was 130, and he is now at 135. Tucker has an .839 OPS at Wrigley Field as compared to .905 on the road, where 12 of his 17 homers have been hit. But if warmer weather and outward-blowing winds become consistent in Chicago, a Tucker power surge could be in the offing. If that happens, look out.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Cy Young</h2><p><strong>American League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"2e709af2-d8bb-3d70-978d-f33a50695c14\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42409/tarik-skubal\">Tarik Skubal</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b27c64bf-4f18-f713-ba06-db1bce2394e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/det/detroit-tigers\">Detroit Tigers</a> (151 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine: </strong>2. <a data-player-guid=\"758d4fc6-a046-3dc0-9280-c6279357128c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4297835/garrett-crochet\">Garrett Crochet</a>, Red Sox (149); 3.

A few more weeks have brought AXE in line with reality, as Skubal has gone to that magical place few pitchers ever reach.</p><p>Skubal's blastoff actually began when we posted the last Awards Watch, as he was coming off a complete-game, two-hit shutout against Cleveland. Perhaps the most impressive part of that outing is that he recorded 13 strikeouts on just 94 pitches. Well, since then, Skubal did the same thing to Minnesota: 13 whiffs on 93 pitches on June 29.</p><p>In eight outings following the last Watch, Skubal has gone 5-1 with a 1.89 ERA, thrown at least seven innings five times and posted an absurd ratio of 61 strikeouts to nine walks. This race isn't over, but it's clearly Skubal's to win.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> DeGrom missed the top 10 last time, but since then, he has shown every indication of ramping back up to his historic level of stifling run prevention. He's doing it a little differently than he did in his Mets heyday, emphasizing pitch efficiency to a greater extent.</p><p>DeGrom's 26% strikeout rate is his lowest in nearly a decade, and he has reached double digits in whiffs just once this season. But he has a sparkling 2.32 ERA and has been at 2.20 over eight starts since the last Awards Watch. He had a string of five straight starts when he threw at least six innings, reaching seven twice, all without hitting the 90-pitch mark.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Crochet has been coming on like gangbusters, as has the team around him. He finished his first half with a complete-game, three-hit shutout of Tampa Bay, closing the AXE gap between him and Skubal. Crochet leads the AL in innings pitched (129⅓), strikeouts (160) and ERA+ (185). We've seen Skubal do this for a full season; now, it's up to Crochet to prove he can match the reigning Cy Young winner start for start in what's shaping up as a great race.</p><hr><p><strong>National League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"cdfd69c1-1b9b-30fe-acf4-aad457b0850e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719507/paul-skenes\">Paul Skenes</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> (150 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2. <a data-player-guid=\"150fa88b-caca-cd7c-3ea9-353c2a361244\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31267/zack-wheeler\">Zack Wheeler</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> (148); 3. <a data-player-guid=\"8a57ca6c-4738-321a-a2aa-54eb43e2d96b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42359/cristopher-sanchez\">Cristopher Sanchez</a>, Phillies (143); 4. <a data-player-guid=\"5f496806-d3fa-4226-e557-dc945eda4f3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39636/mackenzie-gore\">MacKenzie Gore</a>, Nationals (135); 5. <a data-player-guid=\"83c3dc73-d5c3-4be0-d9df-93f264e72220\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36071/nick-pivetta\">Nick Pivetta</a>, Padres (133); 6. <a data-player-guid=\"a2a28cf0-f1f0-f347-a089-692e3da7b293\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39817/ranger-suarez\">Ranger Suarez</a>, Phillies (132); 7.

Recently, I re-pitched the notion of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45575126/2025-mlb-pitcher-wins-paul-skenes-new-formula-game-scores-analytics\">a revised win-loss record based on game scores</a>, so that's worth taking a fresh look at to see if the difference in the traditional records is misleading.</p><p>Well, it is and it isn't. Skenes has suffered a string of hard-luck game score losses of late and now sits at 11-9 by that method. Wheeler, meanwhile, is an MLB-best 16-3. Wheeler also has a solid edge in average game score at 65.2, as compared to 63.2 for Skenes. For now, Wheeler has the edge.</p><p>Will it last? Consider another byproduct of that game score work: pitcher temperature. You win a game score matchup, the temp goes up. You lose, it goes down. Each starter begins his career at the average temperature of 72 degrees, and it goes back and forth from there. The hottest starter in baseball by this method: Wheeler, at 127.2 degrees. Because of his recent bad run, Skenes has cooled to 68.7 degrees.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> For now, Sanchez has seized the spot just behind Wheeler, which of course makes him a mere No. 2 in his own rotation. Sanchez was overlooked when the NL All-Star rosters were released, and it was a true oversight. Like Wheeler, Sanchez has been fiery hot, with a string of excellent outings since the last Awards Watch. Over nine starts during that span, Sanchez has 1.77 ERA and 2.11 FIP, while pitching seven innings or more six times.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Let's just stick with our Phillies theme and keep our eyes on their whole rotation. Wheeler (second), Sanchez (third) and Suarez (sixth) are entrenched in the top 10. Meanwhile, <a data-player-guid=\"31b52969-26e1-6862-3e22-cb52673d5fd4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39667/jesus-luzardo\">Jesus Luzardo</a> (126 AXE), who led this category last time out, just missed giving the Phillies four rotation members in the top 10.

He was hitting .348 at the last Awards Watch then went out and pushed that number to .372 on June 8. Since then, Wilson has hit just .222 and has just three extra-base hits over 24 games. Wilson's quick beginning turned enough heads to get him voted as the AL's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game. But he has been replaced by Smith as the AL Rookie of the Year favorite at ESPN BET.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> Smith has mashed his way into prominence, but he's proving to be a well-rounded young hitter despite just 32 games of minor league experience. Alas, his surprising .277 batting average is driven by a .378 BABIP that doesn't seem likely to hold up. However, Smith has just seven homers, and if his game power starts to match his raw power, he can easily replace any loss in average with a gain in slugging.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Kurtz has been picking up the pace, especially in the power category, manifesting what was his calling card prior to reaching the majors. Kurtz hit the IL with a hip injury on the day the last Awards Watch went out. He had just started to drive the ball before getting hurt, and he has gone right on slugging since he came back. After homering just once over his first 23 games, Kurtz has since gone deep 16 times in 35 contests while slugging .713 in the process.</p><hr><p><strong>National League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"dffe573b-a9b5-3fdc-8932-fa202585a91b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5007615/caleb-durbin\">Caleb Durbin</a>, Brewers (113 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2.

Before locking in any Super Bowl 60 futures bets, you'll want to see what Kaylor has to say. New users can even take advantage of the&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings promo code</a></span>&nbsp;offering $150 in bonus bets instantly with a $5 wager.</p><p>Kaylor posted a 55-34-4 record on NFL point spread and over/under picks during the 2024 season, profiting 15.78 units ($1,578 for a $100 bettor).</p><p><strong>Here are Kaylor's top three Super Bowl 60 futures bets (placed July 10, 2025 - odds subject to change)</strong></p><ul><li>Baltimore Ravens (+700 at BetMGM)</li><li>Detroit Lions (+1000 at FanDuel)</li><li>Pittsburgh Steelers (+4500 at FanDuel)</li></ul><h2>Baltimore Ravens (+700 at BetMGM)</h2><p>The Ravens were among the top Super Bowl contenders in the league for the entire 2024 season, before ultimately losing to the Buffalo Bills in the Divisional Round of the AFC Playoffs. Two-time NFL MVP <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181169/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> has yet to play in a Super Bowl, and a world championship is about the only thing missing from his impressive career resume. Baltimore had a productive offseason, continuing to build around Jackson, while also bolstering its already strong defense with the additions of cornerback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181152/jaire-alexander/\">Jaire Alexander</a> and safety <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28876050/malaki-starks/\">Malaki Starks</a> to its secondary. I don't expect this number to get much higher than 7-1, so I wanted to jump on it early. New users can use a&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">BetMGM promo code</a></span>&nbsp;to get even more value.&nbsp;</p><h2>Detroit Lions (+1000 at FanDuel)</h2><p>The Lions have been one of the top teams in the NFL for the last two seasons, but they haven't been able to get over the hump in the NFC playoffs. Detroit bolstered its roster on the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball this offseason, and Defensive Player of the Year candidate <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2968514/aidan-hutchinson/\">Aidan Hutchinson</a> will be back at full strength. The Lions are a complete team, and barring injury, I expect them to be listed among the top Super Bowl LX contenders all season. Use a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">FanDuel promo code</a></span> to get more bang for your buck if you are backing the Lions to win Super Bowl LX.</p><h2>Pittsburgh Steelers (+4500 at FanDuel)</h2><p>The Steelers were one of the most aggressive teams in the NFL this offseason, and on paper, they appear to be set up nicely for a potential title run this fall. Defensively, Pittsburgh once again should be among the best in the NFL, and the additions of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2081506/jonnu-smith/\">Jonnu Smith</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260185/dk-metcalf/\">DK Metcalf</a> adds explosiveness to the team's offensive attack. Of course, Pittsburgh's Super Bowl hopes fall squarely on the shoulders of quarterback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a>. If the 41-year-old QB is anywhere near the player he was at the tail end of his time with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Green Bay Packers</a>, the Steelers will be among the top teams in the AFC.</p><h2>Looking for more football picks?</h2><p><strong>The SportsLine Projection Model has revealed and is constantly updating its Fantasy football cheat sheets. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07162025_agg_cbssports_football_NFL_kaylor_SuperBowlFutures\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to see the top Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts, and busts, all from the model that outperformed human experts in 2024</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

While the running backs have the chance to be dominant, Chase is the easy selection for me based on what he accomplished in 2024 and, more importantly, what he should do again in 2025.</p><p>It would be amazing if Chase could repeat what he did last season when he was the Triple Crown winner with the most receptions (127), receiving yards (1,708) and receiving touchdowns (17). Only Jerry Rice (1990), Sterling Sharpe (1992), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/235157/steve-smith/fantasy/\">Steve Smith</a> (2005) and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2006951/cooper-kupp/fantasy/\">Cooper Kupp</a> (2021) have accomplished that feat since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. He's also the first receiver in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history to eclipse both 1,700 receiving yards and 17 receiving touchdowns in a single season. He averaged 23.7 PPR points per game, and Chase should be elite once again with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/fantasy/\">Joe Burrow</a>.</p><p>I'm not going to hesitate to select Chase with the No. 1 overall pick in PPR. And that's what happened here when I had that selection.</p><p>This is our 12-part, pick-by-pick series where me, Adam Aizer, Thomas Shafer, Jacob Gibbs, Heath Cummings and Dan Schneier all took part in a six-person PPR mock draft. We each built two of the 12 teams in this 14-round draft to show you a different strategy from each spot.</p>\n        \n\n<p>This is an outline that you can follow if you pick No. 1 overall in your league. The key is to study the strategy, not necessarily the players, to see if it works for you.&nbsp;</p><p>After you draft Chase, you have to see who falls to you at the Round 2-3 turn, and you'll have plenty of great options. There could be two standout running backs available from the group of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693770/bucky-irving/fantasy/\">Bucky Irving</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2257876/josh-jacobs/fantasy/\">Josh Jacobs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965160/chase-brown/fantasy/\">Chase Brown</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121836/kyren-williams/fantasy/\">Kyren Williams</a>. You might see <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809208/tee-higgins/fantasy/\">Tee Higgins</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163962/ladd-mcconkey/fantasy/\">Ladd McConkey</a> on the board. And, potentially, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963385/trey-mcbride/fantasy/\">Trey McBride</a> could be available, along with several of the top-tier quarterbacks, including <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/fantasy/\">Lamar Jackson</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/fantasy/\">Josh Allen</a>.</p><p>My preferred start to building a roster from No. 1 overall is to draft one of the running backs along with McConkey or McBride to go with Chase. I like Higgins a lot, but I don't want to draft both <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> receivers with two of my first three picks. I'm also not opposed to going RB-RB with these selections as well.</p>\n        \n\n<p>I was thrilled with how it worked out here with Jacobs as my Round 2 selection and McConkey in Round 3, and I now have two of my top 12 receivers and a top-10 running back. And since Hero-RB is my favorite draft strategy, I was on my way with this roster.</p><p>As a reference point, all touchdowns in this league are worth six points, and we award one point for every 10 yards rushing and receiving and one point for every 25 yards passing. We also award one point for every reception. We feature a starting lineup of QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, TE and FLEX (RB/WR/TE).&nbsp;</p><h2>My draft from the No. 1 overall pick:</h2><p>1.1: Ja'Marr Chase, WR, Bengals</p><p>2.12: Josh Jacobs, RB, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a></p><p>3.1: Ladd McConkey, WR, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a></p><p>4.12: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1125258/d-j-moore/fantasy/\">D.J.

I know the player pool I'll be choosing from with my first three selections, but you never know who will fall to you at No. 48 overall. You might get lucky and someone like Joe Burrow, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/fantasy/\">Jalen Hurts</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818265/george-kittle/fantasy/\">George Kittle</a> could be available, but most likely those players will be drafted, which happened here.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Ideally, if Burrow, Hurts and Kittle are gone, I'd like to draft two receivers to join Chase and McConkey, and I just missed on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2218461/courtland-sutton/fantasy/\">Courtland Sutton</a>, who went at No. 47 overall to Adam Aizer, who was clearly using my rankings (thanks Adam). I ended up with Moore, who will hopefully be the best receiver for the Bears, and then I decided to pivot in Round 5.</p><p>While receivers like <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26730787/xavier-worthy/fantasy/\">Xavier Worthy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/fantasy/\">Travis Hunter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741201/jerry-jeudy/fantasy/\">Jerry Jeudy</a> were enticing selections, I went with Kamara instead as my No. 2 running back. He makes me nervous given his age (he turns 30 this month), and the Saints could be terrible this season with the uncertainty at quarterback. But he also offers huge upside in this format based on role in the passing game, and I felt he was the best player on the board in this spot.</p><p>At the next turn, I was also met with some tough choices in Rounds 6 and 7. I had no quarterback or tight end, and I had plenty of choices since only six quarterbacks (Jackson, Allen, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/fantasy/\">Jayden Daniels</a>, Hurts, Burrow and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/fantasy/\">Patrick Mahomes</a>) and four tight ends (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693971/brock-bowers/fantasy/\">Brock Bowers</a>, McBride, Kittle and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124197/sam-laporta/fantasy/\">Sam LaPorta</a>) were drafted at that point.</p>\n        \n\n<p>I decided to wait on those positions and went with the best-players available, which were Johnson and Pickens. Now, I do have <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963666/chris-olave/fantasy/\">Chris Olave</a> ranked ahead of Pickens, and Olave was on the board. But I didn't want to draft two Saints, at least as of now, because of the potential of New Orleans just being an offensive disaster.</p><p>My next three picks were probably my favorite selections in Kelce, Mooney and Prescott. While Kelce is past his prime (he turns 36 in October) and now faces significant competition for targets from <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124978/rashee-rice/fantasy/\">Rashee Rice</a>, Worthy and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804128/marquise-brown/fantasy/\">Marquise Brown</a>, this felt like a steal. Kelce still averaged 12.2 PPR points per game in 2024, and he was third among tight ends in targets (133) and receptions (97) and fifth in yards (823). If he can score more than the three touchdowns he had last season then Kelce could be a top-five tight end once again.</p><p>You can read about Mooney below, and I loved getting Prescott in Round 10. Unless I get a bargain on Draft Day at quarterback like Burrow or Hurts in Round 5, I'm almost always going to wait on the position, and Prescott offers top-10 upside this season.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>He missed nine games last season due to a hamstring injury, but he's healthy now. And prior to 2024, he averaged at least 24.7 Fantasy points per game in four of the previous five seasons. The addition of Pickens to go with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lamb/fantasy/\">CeeDee Lamb</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867159/jake-ferguson/fantasy/\">Jake Ferguson</a> gives Prescott a standout receiving corps, and the run game in Dallas could be awful. Prescott is one of my favorite late-round quarterbacks to target this year.</p><p>My final four selections for this roster were all about upside, and I like my reserve running backs in White, Sampson and Braelon Allen. We could see Sampson's value rise if <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28878286/quinshon-judkins/fantasy/\">Quinshon Judkins</a> is suspended in Cleveland, and White and Allen are lottery tickets if an injury occurs.</p><p>Keenan Allen remains unsigned at the time of publication, but he could end up as a No. 3 Fantasy receiver this year depending on where he signs. He could be a steal with this pick, but he's also easy to drop if the right player emerges on the waiver wire during the season.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Favorite pick: Darnell Mooney</h2><p>Last year, Mooney had 64 catches for 992 yards and five touchdowns on 106 targets in his first year in Atlanta. He had eight outings with at least 13.2 PPR points, and he did well as the No. 2 receiver for the Falcons opposite <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3127902/drake-london/fantasy/\">Drake London</a>. Mooney only had one healthy game with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963496/michael-penix-jr/fantasy/\">Michael Penix Jr</a>. in Week 16 against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a>, and Mooney finished with five catches for 82 yards on six targets. There's a lot to like about Mooney as a Fantasy receiver this season, especially his value in Round 9 here. He could easily be a starter on this team.</p><h2>Pick I might regret: D.J. Moore</h2><p>There are a lot of moving parts in Chicago's passing game with Moore, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162979/rome-odunze/fantasy/\">Rome Odunze</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2868619/cole-kmet/fantasy/\">Cole Kmet</a> back, Keenan Allen gone and the addition of rookies <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28874696/colston-loveland/fantasy/\">Colston Loveland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28874444/luther-burden-iii/fantasy/\">Luther Burden III</a>. With <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/395994/ben-johnson/fantasy/\">Ben Johnson</a> calling plays and a revamped offensive line for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695775/caleb-williams/fantasy/\">Caleb Williams</a>, there's a lot to like about all of these guys. Moore will hopefully be the best pass catcher of the bunch, and I love him as the No. 3 receiver on my roster. But if Moore is not the Bears best receiver and takes a step back from the 14.0 PPR points he averaged last season then this pick is a problem. And I'll regret not taking another receiver instead like Xavier Worthy, Travis Hunter or Jerry Jeudy.</p><h2>Player who could make or break my team: Alvin Kamara</h2><p>Kamara was the No. 5 running back last season in PPR points per game at 18.9. He led all running backs in targets with 89 despite missing three games, and he was second to only <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3171161/devon-achane/fantasy/\">De'Von Achane</a> in receptions (68) and receiving yards (543). Kamara also has just one season on his resume with fewer than 17.8 PPR points per game in eight years. We'll see if he can defy Father Time in his age 30 season, and hopefully the offense in New Orleans isn't terrible with either <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964064/tyler-shough/fantasy/\">Tyler Shough</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125863/spencer-rattler/fantasy/\">Spencer Rattler</a> as the starting quarterback. Kamara played four games with Rattler in 2024, and he scored at least 17 PPR points in three of those outings and averaged 15.3 PPR points over that span. If he remains an elite PPR running back then Kamara is a steal in Round 5. But if there's a dip in his production then I could be scrambling at running back, which isn't ideal given the investment with a top 50 overall pick.</p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

He covers college football, soccer and tennis. He has been at ESPN since 2019.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p>Back in May, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/45026603/ranking-best-coaches-college-football-2025\">ESPN's team of college football reporters voted</a> on the sport's best coaches for 2025. The results were about as you would expect: Start with the three active guys who have most recently won national titles (Georgia's Kirby Smart, Ohio State's Ryan Day, Clemson's Dabo Swinney), move on to guys with recent top-five finishes or national title game appearances (Notre Dame's Marcus Freeman, Texas' Steve Sarkisian, Oregon's Dan Lanning, Alabama's Kalen DeBoer, Penn State's James Franklin), then squeeze in a couple of long-term overachievers at the end (Utah's Kyle Whittingham, Iowa State's Matt Campbell).</p><p>The rankings made plenty of sense, but I couldn't help but notice that the top eight coaches on the list all work for some of the richest, most well-supported programs in the country. There are some epic pressures associated with leading these programs -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/43500974/ohio-state-college-football-national-championship-quiets-haters\">just ask Day</a> -- but there are also major advantages. It might only take a good head coach to do great things in those jobs, while at programs with smaller alumni bases or lesser historic track records, it might take a great coach to do merely good things. They're such different jobs that it's almost impossible to even know how to compare the performance of, say, Matt Campbell to Steve Sarkisian. Could Campbell have led Texas to back-to-back CFP semifinals? Could Sark have brought ISU its first two AP top-15 finishes?</p><p>The May rankings made me want to see if there were a way to apply stats to the conversation. If you think about it, we're basically measuring two things when we're gauging coach performance: overall quality and quality relative to the expectations of the job. I thought it would be fun to come up with a blend of those two things and see what the results told us.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Performance versus expectation</h2><p>Gauging overall performance is easy enough. You could simply look at win percentage, and it would tell you quite a bit. From 2015 to 2024, the active coaches with the best FBS win percentages (minimum 30 games) were Day (.870), Lanning (.854), Swinney (.850) and Smart (.847). All ranked high in the May rankings. I tend to want to get fancy and use my SP+ ratings whenever possible, and they tell a similar tale. Looking at average SP+ ratings for the past decade, the top active coaches are Day (30.4), Smart (27.0), Lanning (22.3), Swinney (21.9), Franklin (20.3) and Freeman (19.0). They're all in the May top 10 too.</p><p>Again, though, all of those coaches are employed by college football royalty. (Granted, Swinney gets bonus points for helping Clemson turn <i>into</i> college football royalty, but still.) Isn't it more impressive to win 11 regular-season games at Indiana, as Curt Cignetti did in 2024, than to go 10-4 like Swinney did? Isn't it probably harder to finish 12th in SP+ at SMU, as Rhett Lashlee did in 2024, than to finish fifth like Franklin did?</p><p>I've begun to incorporate teams' performance against long-term averages into <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/insider/story/_/id/44138328/college-football-coaching-changes-affecting-offense-defense\">my preseason SP+ projections</a>, and it seems we could use a very similar concept to evaluate coach performances. For each year someone is a head coach, we could compare his team's SP+ rating for that season to the school's average from the 20 previous years. (If the school is newer to FBS and doesn't have a 20-year average, we can use whatever average exists to date. And for a program's first FBS season, we can simply compare the team's SP+ rating to the overall average for first-year programs.)</p><p>By this method, the 10 best single-season coaching performances of the past 20 years include Art Briles at Baylor in 2013-14, Jim Harbaugh at Stanford in 2010, Mark Mangino at Kansas in 2007, Bobby Petrino at Louisville in 2006, Greg Schiano at Rutgers in 2006 and Jamey Chadwell at Coastal Carolina in 2020 -- legendary seasons of overachievement -- plus perhaps lesser-remembered performances such as Gary Andersen at Utah State in 2012, Matt Wells at Utah State in 2018 and Brian Kelly at Cincinnati in 2007.</p><p>As far as single-season overachievement goes, that's a pretty good list. And if we look at a longer-term sample -- coaches who have led FBS programs for at least nine of the past 20 years -- here are the 15 best performance versus baseline averages.</p><p>(<i>Note: I'm looking only at performances within the past 20 years, so Nick Saban's work at LSU (2000-04) or Michigan State (1995-99), for instance, isn't included. I also went with nine years instead of 10 so Smart's current nine-year run at Georgia could be included in the sample.</i>)</p><p><strong>Best performance vs. historic baseline averages for the past 20 years (min. nine seasons):</strong></p><p>1. Chris Petersen, Boise State (2006-13) and Washington (2014-19): +12.8 points above historic baseline</p><p>2. Art Briles, Houston (2005-07) and Baylor (2008-15): +12.8</p><p>3. Gary Pinkel, Missouri (2005-15): +12.5</p><p>4. Nick Saban, Alabama (2007-23): +10.7</p><p>5. Jeff Monken, Army (2014-24): +10.3</p><p>6. Willie Fritz, Georgia Southern (2014-15), Tulane (2016-23) and Houston (2024): +10.0</p><p>7. Lance Leipold, Buffalo (2015-20) and Kansas (2021-24): +9.5</p><p>8. Bobby Petrino, Louisville (2005-06), Arkansas (2008-11), Western Kentucky (2013) and Louisville (2014-18): +9.5</p><p>9. Gary Patterson, TCU (2005-21): +8.6</p><p>10. Jim Harbaugh, Stanford (2007-10) and Michigan (2015-23): +8.5</p><p>11. Blake Anderson, Arkansas State (2014-20) and Utah State (2021-23): +8.5</p><p>12. Steve Spurrier, South Carolina (2005-15): +8.2</p><p>13. Greg Schiano, Rutgers (2005-11 and 2020-24): +7.8</p><p>14. Jeff Brohm, Western Kentucky (2014-16), Purdue (2017-22) and Louisville (2023-24): +7.7</p><p>15. David Cutcliffe, Duke (2008-21): +7.7</p><p>If we are looking for pure overachievement and aren't in the mood to reward coaches for winning at schools that always win, this is again a pretty good list. Petersen was spectacular at both Boise State and Washington, while Briles, Pinkel, Monken and Patterson all won big at schools that hadn't won big in quite a while. (Monken, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/42824521/army-wins-aac-championship-first-attempt-beating-tulane\">is still winning big</a>.) Blake Anderson's presence surprised me, but most of the names here are extremely well regarded. And Saban's presence at No. 4, despite coaching at one of the bluest of blue-blood programs, is a pretty good indicator of just how special his reign at Alabama was.</p><p>Still, looking only at performance against expectations obviously sells coaches like Saban and Smart short. Saban is probably <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/39281965/alabama-nick-saban-best-college-coach-ever\">the best head coach in the sport's history</a> but ranks <i>only</i> fourth on the above list. Meanwhile, Smart has overachieved by <i>only</i> 6.0 points above the historic baseline in his nine seasons at Georgia thanks to the high bar that predecessor Mark Richt set. But he has also won two national titles, overcoming Georgia's history of falling just short and at least briefly surpassing Saban as well. If our goal is to measure coaching prowess, we need to account for raw quality too.</p><hr><h2>The best coaches of the past 20 years</h2><p>If we combine raw SP+ averages with this performance versus baseline average, we can come up with a pretty decent overall coach rating. We can debate the weights involved, but here's what an overall rating looks like if we use 60% performance versus baseline and 40% SP+ average:</p><p>I always like to say that numbers make great starting points for a conversation, and this is a pretty good starting point. Anyone reading this would probably tweak this list to suit their own preferences, and while it probably isn't surprising that Pinkel is in the top 20, seeing him fourth, ahead of Meyer, Harbaugh and others, is a bit jarring. (I promise that this Mizzou alum didn't put his finger on the scales.) Regardless, this is a fun mix of guys who won big at big schools and guys who won pretty big at pretty big schools. That was the goal of the exercise.</p><p>Maybe the most confusing coach in this top 20 is Dabo Swinney. Clemson had enjoyed just one AP top-five finish in its history before he took over 16 years ago, and he has led the Tigers to 2 national titles, 6 top-five finishes and 7 CFP appearances. And while they haven't had a true, title-caliber team in a few years, they've still won two of the past three ACC crowns. How is he only 10th?</p><p>The main culprit for Swinney's lower-than-expected ranking is his recent performance -- it has been inferior to both national title standards and <i>his</i> standards. Since we're using a team's performance against 20-year averages, a lot of this rating is basically comparing Swinney to himself, and he hasn't quite measured up of late.</p><p>From 2012 to 2020, Swinney's average rating was an incredible 17.0, which would have ranked second to only Saban on the list above. But his average over the past four seasons is only 3.6.</p><p>Part of what made Saban so impressive was how long he managed to clear the bar he himself was setting in Tuscaloosa. Per SP+, his best team was his 14th -- the 2020 team that won his sixth and final title at Bama. While Swinney was basically matching Saban's standard 12 years into their respective tenures, Saban continued at a particularly high level for at least three more years while Swinney fell off the pace.</p><p>Comparing Saban, Swinney and Smart year by year, we see that Smart was hitting Saban-esque levels seven seasons into his tenure, but his rating has fallen off each of the past two seasons. Even Saban slipped starting in Year 15, even though he still had nearly the best program in the sport for a couple more years.</p><hr><h2>The best coaches of 2025</h2><p>Six of the top seven coaches on the list above are either retired or coaching in the NFL now, so let's focus our gaze specifically on the guys who will be leading college teams out onto the field in 2025. Using the same 20-year sample as above -- which cuts off the tenure of Iowa's Kirk Ferentz but includes everything else -- here's how the current crop of FBS head coaches has performed at the FBS level. We'll break this into two samples: the guys who have coached for at least four years in this sample and the guys who have coached between one and three years.</p><p>Our May top 10 list featured eight guys who have been head coaches for at least four years; all eight are represented on this list, including four of the top five. (Sarkisian has averaged a 13.8 rating over the past two seasons, which is a top-five level, but his overall run as head coach at Washington, USC and Texas has featured a number of ups and downs.)</p><p>Maybe the name that jumps out the most above is Josh Heupel. I think anyone would consider him a very good coach (he is 37-15 overall), but he doesn't exactly draw any \"best in the game?\" hype. He benefited from a positive situation at UCF, where he inherited a rising program from Scott Frost in 2019 and produced big ratings in his first couple of years on the job. But his average rating at Tennessee has been a solid 14.0 as well; the Volunteers had been up and down for years, but he has produced four top-20 SP+ ratings in a row and two top-10s in the past three years. He might not be getting the credit he deserves for that.</p><p>All in all, I enjoy this list. We've got mostly predictable names at the top, we've got some oldies but (mostly) goodies spread throughout, and we've got room for up-and-comers like Jeff Traylor too. This 60-40 approach probably doesn't give enough respect to the Chris Creightons of the world -- the Eastern Michigan coach has overachieved against EMU's baseline by 7.2 points per season, which is a fantastic average, but at such a hard job, his Eagles have still averaged only a minus-14.4 SP+ rating during his tenure. Still, this is a mostly solid approach.</p><p>Now let's talk about some small-sample all-stars.</p><p>Four of the top six of this list coached in the College Football Playoff last season, and while the guys ranked fifth and sixth made our May top 10 list, the guys who won big at SMU and Indiana, not Oregon and Notre Dame, take priority here. I was honestly floored that Curt Cignetti didn't make our top 10 list; he led James Madison to one of the best FBS debuts ever, going 19-4 in 2022-23, then he moved to Bloomington and led Indiana -- <i>INDIANA!</i> -- to 11 wins in his first season there.</p><p>On this list, however, Rhett Lashlee tops even Cignetti. I'm not sure we've talked enough about the job he has done at SMU. He, too, inherited a rising program, as Sonny Dykes had done some of the nitty-gritty work in getting the Mustangs back on their feet (with help from an offensive coordinator named Rhett Lashlee). SMU hadn't produced a top-50 ranking since 1985 before Dykes did so for three straight seasons (2019-21). But after holding steady in his first year replacing Dykes, Lashlee's program has ignited: 12-2 and 24th in SP+ in 2023, then 11-3 and 12th in 2024. Looking specifically at the 2021-24 range, as the game has undergone so much change, Lashlee's 16.8 average rating ranks second overall, behind only Smart (18.0) and ahead of Kiffin (15.1), Cignetti (15.0), Odom (15.0), Heupel (14.0) and Day (13.9).</p><p>Along with quite a few others here, Lashlee made <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/insider/story/_/id/39906012/kirby-smart-deion-sanders-30-coaches-define-college-football\">my 2024 list of 30 coaches</a> who would define the next decade; he'd definitely still be on the list -- along with new additions like GJ Kinne and perhaps Fran Brown -- if I remade that list today.</p>\n</div></div>"

But his play under the brightest of lights has left something to be desired. He hasn't beaten Ohio State or Michigan, he delivered some good moments in a Big Ten championship game loss to Oregon but was still intercepted twice, and threw the crucial interception in a CFP semifinal loss to Notre Dame. Penn State has made the necessary investments around Allar, who will share a backfield with probably the nation's top running back tandem. The time has come for the senior to be at his best in the biggest moments. If he delivers, Penn State will have a real chance at its first national title since 1986. -- <em>Adam Rittenberg</em></p><hr><h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/228.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"> 2. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"02382072-a5a3-24ff-6bd1-422a029bd33c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/228/clemson-tigers\">Clemson Tigers</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> Run defense</p><p>Though the Tigers have had standout players across their front seven over the past few years, that group has fallen short in one particular area -- rush defense -- and it became glaring last season. The truth is, its decline began when Wes Goodwin took over as defensive coordinator. In each of his three seasons, the rush defense has gotten worse, culminating in what became a major issue in 2024. Clemson gave up 160.6 yards on the ground, and there isn't much more proof needed as to how poorly the Tigers attempted to stop the run than their playoff loss to Texas, when the Longhorns rushed for 292 yards. Clemson tackled poorly and often took bad angles. This season Tom Allen takes over after leading one of the best rushing defenses in the country at Penn State. Expect this area to be vastly improved, returning to the standard Clemson set under Brent Venables. -- <em>Andrea Adelson</em></p><hr><h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/251.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\">3. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"013a8bab-0dd5-f6a0-45e6-1128a124f34b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/251/texas-longhorns\">Texas Longhorns</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> Middle of the defensive line</p><p>Texas has been loaded the past two seasons, but one of the reasons it made back-to-back CFP semifinal trips were the big men in the middle of the defensive line.

The Dodgers have a number of approaches they can take, and they're fond of hoarding high-leverage relief arms with an eye toward October.

The 27-year-old is already a seven-time PGA Tour winner and an 11-time winner worldwide and he's become a fixture near the top of major championship leaderboards. He's already posted four top-five finishes in major championships, including a t-4th at the 2022 Open Championship.</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"Hovland bounced back from the surprising withdrawal at the Travelers Championship with a solid T11 at the Scottish Open. In his last three events, including the WD, Hovland has gained a combined 22 shots on approach, which is my favorite measure of predicted success. The Norwegian finished solo 3rd at the season's third major at Oakmont, gaining nearly 15 shots tee to green in the process. With three top-13 finish among four Open Championship starts, this finishing position might actually be a notch too low for Hovland, who has solid upside,\" Cohen told SportsLine.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/pga-longshot-parlay-get-sportslines-top-pga-tour-picks-for-2025-open-championship-with-a-shot-at-a-monster-return/#ttag=07142025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_cohen_OpenChampionshipMillionParlay\" target=\"_blank\">See the rest of the picks in Cohen's PGA Tour parlay here</a>.</p><p>Cohen is also backing Tommy Fleetwood to finish in the top 10, a prop that returns +250 in our DraftKings parlay.

The accolades keep stacking for the best player in the world, and it doesn't look like he is going to be slowing down anytime soon.</p><p>Scheffler's run has led to comparisons to all-time greats -- most noticeably Tiger Woods, given the proximity in time. Scheffler is on pace to become the first golfer to lead the PGA Tour in total strokes gained in three straight seasons since Woods did from 2005-07, and his 16 PGA Tour wins are the most in such a span since Woods from 2007-10.</p><p>Entering The Open Championship, Scheffler has the shortest odds in the field at 9/2, not quite the 5/2 favoritism Woods enjoyed in 2009 but nevertheless atop the board, per <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\">Caesars</a>.</p><p>\"I could not care any less about being the favorite or not being the favorite,\" Scheffler said. \"We all start even par and the tournament starts on Thursday. That's pretty much all that matters.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/scottie-scheffler-questions-why-he-chases-major-championships-ahead-of-the-open-2025-at-royal-portrush/\" target=\"_blank\">Scheffler contends his golf does not define him</a></span>, and this mindset is largely his superpower: The ability to give everything you have in a moment to the shot at hand and not care about the results. It's an enviable position from which to play golf. It is a place of no fear. The outcome truly does not matter in his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>\"There's a lot of people that make it to what they thought was going to fulfill them in life, and you get there, you get to No. 1 in the world, and they're like, <em>what's the point?</em> I really do believe that because, what is the point?\" Scheffler questioned. \"Why do I want to win this tournament so bad? That's something that I wrestle with on a daily basis.</p><p>\"It's like showing up at the Masters every year; why do I want to win this golf tournament so badly? Why do I want to win The Open Championship so badly? I don't know because, if I win, it's going to be awesome for two minutes. Then we're going to get to the next week, <em>hey, you won two majors this year; how important is it for you to win the FedExCup playoffs?</em> And we're back here again.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>In between Scheffler's ears, there are no consequences to his on-course actions. Life rolls on outside golf.&nbsp;</p><p>But when stacked against the best to ever to do it inside the ropes, there are implications to his results. More trophies and more chatter. More accolades and more comparisons. This is sport after all. And one accomplishment the three-time major champion has yet to tick off on his to-do list is not only winning The Open but capturing winning more than one major championship in the same season.</p><h2>Players with multiple seasons of 2+ majors</h2><table data-title=\"12x2 Table\"><tbody><tr><th>Player</th><th>Years</th></tr><tr><td><p>Gene Sarazen</p></td><td><p>1922, 1932</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bobby Jones</p></td><td><p>1926, 1930</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ben Hogan</p></td><td><p>1948, 1951, 1953</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Arnold Palmer</p></td><td><p>1960, 1962</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jack Nicklaus</p></td><td><p>1963, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1980</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tom Watson</p></td><td><p>1977, 1982</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tiger Woods</p></td><td><p>2000, 2002, 2005, 2006</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br>Only seven players in the history of the game have accomplished the feat multiple times with only Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Ben Hogan being able to say they did it at least three times. These three are largely regarded as the greatest to ever play the game, and they are followed closely by some of the other names on the list.</p><p>The jump to that echelon will take time and a whole lot of winning for Scheffler, but even among his peers, there have been four players to win more than one major in the same season. Rory McIlroy (2014), Jordan Spieth (2015), Brooks Koepka (2018) and Xander Schauffele (2024) have all done it, but not Scheffler ... at least not yet.</p><p>The world No. 1 arrives at Royal Portrush with a rumble of form. He has not finished outside the top 10 since The Players Championship with contention runs at the Masters and the U.S. Open sandwiching his PGA Championship victory at Quail Hollow. His links golf record has been discussed as if it is poor, but it's not. In eight tournaments in this part of the world, the right hander from Texas has finished inside the top 25 in seven of them, which includes legitimate chances at events like last year's Open at Royal Troon.</p><p>\"I love the style of golf,\" Scheffler said. \"I think it's really fun and you have to be creative. You have to hit a lot of really good shots. There's a challenge to it, but I think it's a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>\"We'll see how the weather turns out this week. Weather has a pretty dramatic effect on how the golf course is going to play. You can play your practice rounds and prepare, but ultimately, when you step on the tee on Thursday, whatever the weather presents is going to be probably the strongest part of the test.\"</p><p>From tee to green, Scheffler should impress. It is what he is known for and it is why his floor is so high, but there are two areas which will ultimately define his Open week -- one external and one internal.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I still get very frustrated. At times, I'm better at masking it. … At times this year, I may have gotten overly frustrated. It's just part of the game,\" Scheffler admitted. \"Part of the game is controlling your emotions and controlling your mind. I've definitely gotten better at that over the years. I'd get a bit headless at times when I was growing up, especially when I was young.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/scottie-scheffler-questions-why-he-chases-major-championships-ahead-of-the-open-2025-at-royal-portrush/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Scottie Scheffler questions why he chases major championships ahead of The Open 2025 at Royal Portrush</p>\n                <p>\n                    Patrick McDonald                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Scottie Scheffler questions why he chases major championships ahead of The Open 2025 at Royal Portrush\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/15/90647861-84aa-400c-85f7-532586cdc76d/thumbnail/270x152/1750e172a7b51a7e718e3900ac50faed/scottie-scheffler-looking-open-g.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>There will be frustrating times for Scheffler over the course of his 72 holes in Northern Ireland. A fan of \"fair\" golf courses that reward good shots and penalize poor ones, Scheffler's mettle will be tested by the variability of links golf. Weather draws, switch in wind directions and bad bounces are likely to stand in Scheffler's way. How he sidesteps them is crucial to his chances.</p><p>Tangibly -- as it often has the last few years -- Scheffler's putter will need to show some life as well. The worst inside 10 feet among those who made the cut at the Scottish Open, Scheffler was able to overcome this misdoing en route to a T8 finish, and that has more-or-less the story of his play on links golf courses.</p><p>Fantastic accuracy, pristine precision, uncanny control and underrated creativity best describes his abilities on these courses. But \"lost\" may ultimately be the best way to describe how he performs with the wand in hand as he has bled strokes on the greens in six straight links golf tournaments.</p><p>A flip from negative to positive may be all that is needed to flip Scheffler's major grand total to four. That goes for his putting, and his mentality, too, when adversity inevitably strikes and the top player in the game is left wondering how he can turn a situation up on its head.</p><p>\"Now, I think I do a better job of holding it in,\" Scheffler continued, \"but also getting it over to the next shot and almost sharpening my focus to where I'm in a better spot after a bit of frustration than I am before.\"</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

King Charles also referenced the course in a letter inviting the president to a second state visit to the UK in September.</p><p>However, Darbon said the government had not put any pressure on them to accelerate a return to the Ayrshire course that Trump bought for £39m in 2014. “We’ve spoken to them specifically about Turnberry and I think they’ve made it clear that the decision around where we take our championship rests with us,” he said. “We’ve explicitly not taken it out of our pool of venues but we’d need to address those logistical challenges should we return.”</p><p>The R&amp;A expects to announce the venue for the 2028 Open before the middle of next year – a timescale that would come too soon for Turnberry. However, Portmarnock in the Republic of Ireland is also being considered as a venue in what would be a historic move that would see the Open held outside the United Kingdom for the first time.</p><p>Elsewhere, Darbon also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/08/open-golf-organisers-poised-move-tee-times-amid-concerns-loyalist-parade-disruption\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">confirmed the Guardian story last week</a> that the R&amp;A would be moving the tee times forward on Saturday to avoid a clash with a loyalist march by the Portrush Sons of Ulster.</p><p>More than 60 bands and 2,000 participants are expected to begin their march through the town streets shortly after thousands of spectators will be leaving the sold-out Royal Portrush, and Darbon said the tweak was needed to ensure “both events can run as seamlessly as possible”.</p><p>He said: “We’re making a slight tweak to tee times to try and finish – it’s not dramatic. It’ll be 15 minutes or so earlier. At the same time, this is an outdoor sport. The weather can play a big role. It’s very difficult to be precise on finishing times. But we’re looking at some marginal adjustments.”</p><p>Darbon also refused to deny reports that the R&amp;A had offered the group £20,000 to stage their march on a different day. “We’re actually contributing some incremental costs to support what I just said, the seamless operation of both events. We try to be good citizens in the communities in which we operate when we come to town.”</p></div></div>"

They are waiting for boxing's only eight-division world champion, a politician and the Philippines' most famous athlete, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45619360/manny-pacquiao-biography-record-fights-more\">Manny Pacquiao</a>, to visit his favorite restaurant, as he has been known to do after training at Roach's legendary Vine Street gym, Wild Card Boxing. It had been four years since Pacquiao trained at Wild Card, and those in the crowd weren't sure they'd see him here again.</p><p>Some fans have photos to sign, others have boxing gloves. One person just has a baby and a pen. Some just want to catch a glimpse of the living legend ahead of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45057278/sources-pacquiao-ending-retirement-face-barrios-wbc-belt\">his return fight</a> against WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios on Saturday in Las Vegas.</p><p>\"I'm coming back because boxing is my passion,\" Pacquiao told ESPN. \"It's all I think about, and I really like to make history.\"</p><p>Pacquiao, 46, announced his return to boxing after a four-year retirement following <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/32064447/yordenis-ugas-upsets-manny-pacquiao-decision-retain-wba-title\">his loss to Yordenis Ugas</a> in 2021. The history he speaks of would be breaking his own record as the oldest fighter to win welterweight gold, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/27231617/pacquiao-hands-thurman-1st-career-loss\">a feat he accomplished</a> by beating <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/39745266/keith-thurman-biography-boxing-record-fights-more\">Keith Thurman</a> for the WBA title at age 40 in 2019. He was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45444105/manny-pacquiao-vinny-paz-meet-2025-class-going-international-boxing-hall-fame\">inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame</a> on June 8 and would become the first fighter to win a major world title post-induction, should he defeat Barrios.</p><p>Now, 24 years later, the fighter out of General Santos, Philippines, is back where it all started: training at Wild Card under the watchful eye of Roach as the underdog for a world title fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.</p><hr><p><b>BEHIND A GATED</b> entrance at the rear of the small Freddie Roach Square parking lot behind a door with a sign that reads, \"Please Keep Closed,\" one of the world's most famous boxers grunts and exhales as he shadowboxes, his calves tightening and relaxing with every punch. His friends and family are gathered in the gym, urging him on. Roach, 65, a fighter-turned-trainer who has worked with champions such as Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan and Peter Quillin, among others, is wearing a half smile as he watches his pupil dart around the gym with the same fervor that Roach witnessed in 2001, when a then-unknown Pacquiao visited the gym and asked the trainer to hold mitts for him.</p><p>\"In May 2001, we came to San Francisco just for a vacation and stayed for about a month and a half,\" Pacquiao recalled. \"But we ended up visiting a few gyms in the Bay Area. We then rode a Greyhound bus to Los Angeles and asked around if there was a boxing gym and were pointed to Wild Card.\"</p><p>Roach was impressed from the moment he got in the ring with Pacquiao.</p><p>\"After one round, I went to my corner and told my guys, 'I have a new fighter!' and Manny went to his corner and told [his manager] Rod [Nazario], 'We have a new trainer!'\" Roach told ESPN.</p><p>Less than a week into their new relationship, Pacquiao was called to step in on two weeks' notice to face Lehlo Ledwaba for the IBF junior featherweight title at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in the Filipino's formal introduction to American audiences. It was time to see whether Roach's brief time with Pacquiao would have any impact on his performance.</p><p>Spoiler alert: It did.</p><p>Legendary commentator Jim Lampley has fond memories of meeting Pacquiao for the first time in the lead-up to the fight.</p><p>\"In fighter meetings, Manny struggled to put three or four words of English together,\" Lampley told ESPN. \"He did not have a great deal of English-speaking capacity at that time, but he got his points across. He communicated with us, and the following night he went into the ring and undressed Ledwaba.\"</p><p>To the surprise of everyone watching, Pacquiao tore through the hard-hitting Ledwaba, stopping him in the sixth round to win the second of 12 world titles across a record eight weight classes.</p><p>That night, everything changed for Pacquiao, Roach and Wild Card Boxing.</p><p>\"Once Manny beat Ledwaba, Wild Card felt like it was a Manny Pacquiao Fan Club headquarters,\" Roach said. \"His fans are friendly but relentless. They would congregate in the parking lot to see him when he arrived, they ate lunch next door, bought T-shirts and departed. It's really quite amazing what goes on here when Manny is in town to train for a fight.\"</p><hr><p><b>WHILE THINGS CERTAINLY</b> have changed in the 24 years since that fight, a lot of things remain the same. The fans are still relentless, fans still stop by Nat Thai whenever Pacquiao is preparing for a fight, and the Hall of Famer still looks as determined as ever. He's blasting the heavy bag with force and beating up his sparring partners.</p><p>\"I feel like I'm starting over again,\" Pacquiao said. \"I am so passionate, and the fire is burning inside me again. I went 30 rounds sparring the other day, and Freddie had to step in to make me stop training.\"</p><p>However, the fact remains that this is a 46-year-old boxer coming off a four-year retirement in an improbable attempt to win a world championship. Pacquiao told ESPN he needed the four years to allow his body to heal and to focus on his political career in the Philippines, which included a senatorial term from 2016 to 2022, a presidential run in 2022 that fell short and a failed bid to return to the Senate this year.</p><p>Former Pacquiao opponent-turned-analyst Chris Algieri believes Pacquiao should have taken a tuneup fight before stepping into the ring with Barrios, who is 16 years his junior.</p><p>\"[The time off] absolutely did not help him,\" Algieri, who lost a decision to Pacquiao in 2014, told ESPN.</p><p>Since the Algieri fight, Pacquiao has gone 5-3 and is noticeably slower and less explosive. In his last fight against Ugas, Pacquiao appeared to be apprehensive and, for the first time, couldn't trust his athleticism to put together a substantial offensive explosion. He landed just 16% of his punches, a career low in a 12-round fight. Ugas' jab and power punching dulled every physical edge he had.</p><p>\"I wasn't really 100% focused because I had an ongoing lawsuit with Paradigm Sports Management. There were a lot of distractions and I was bothered all through training camp,\" Pacquiao said. \"On fight night, I couldn't move because my legs were cramping, and that disappointed me because Ugas was the easiest opponent of my career. I lost only because I couldn't move like I wanted to.\"</p><p>\"Far be it from me to say what Manny can and can't do, because I have had a ringside seat to see him do the unthinkable for years, over and over again,\" Lampley said. \"I don't think he'll beat Barrios, and I don't know that I'll be right about that. I could be wrong, but it's not logical. Logic is Father Time. That's the inevitability of ultimate deterioration in boxing. That's just what we have to expect. But if anybody can do it, it's Manny Pacquiao.\"</p><p>It is certainly a risk for a fighter closer to 50 than 40 to ask his body to do the things it used to do, especially against a younger and powerful opponent. But it is a calculated risk that Pacquiao took when the right opportunity presented itself. An opportunity he saw when watching Barrios' less-than-impressive win over Fabian Maidana in May 2024, and again when he battled Abel Ramos to a split draw on the undercard of Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson in November.</p><p>Even though Pacquiao hasn't won a fight in six years, the WBC's rules state <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45377913/manny-pacquiao-back-fight-mario-barrios-boxing-why-getting-title-shot\">a former champion can request a title fight</a> after coming out of retirement.</p><p>\"Barrios is tailormade for Pacquiao,\" Algieri said. \"[Barrios] is a front-foot-heavy fighter who doesn't vary his jab, who fights with his head over his front foot and will stand his ground and trade punches. And he's got pretty slow feet. ... If you're Manny Pacquiao and you're watching Barrios' last two fights, no s--- he thinks he could beat that guy.</p><p>\"But I haven't seen Pacquiao at his best in quite some time.\"</p><p>When Barrios heard Pacquiao had handpicked him for his return bout, he wasn't sure what to think.</p><p>\"It was cool that he knew who I was and wanted to fight me, but I didn't know if to take it as a form of respect or disrespect because he wanted to fight me,\" Barrios said recently. \"I respect him, but he's trying to take my title, and I have to make sure that he doesn't.\"</p><p>To make his return, Pacquiao needed the blessing of his wife, Jinkee, who had asked her husband to retire on numerous occasions, most notably after Pacquiao was brutally knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez in 2012.</p><p>\"She could see that I still had that fire in me,\" Pacquiao said of getting his wife to sign off on his return to boxing. \"I told her that I could beat Barrios and asked her what she thought. She said, 'Yeah, you can fight him. If that's your opponent, prove to me that you can fight.'\"</p><p>Still, even with Jinkee's sign-off, why would he want to come back with all that he has already accomplished?</p><p>\"I always bring surprises,\" a smiling Pacquiao said after hours of training. \"Nobody thought I'd beat Ledwaba. I surprised everyone when I beat Marco Antonio Barrera. Nobody thought I'd beat Erik Morales. I like bringing the fans good surprises and I know I can beat Mario Barrios.\"</p><hr><p><b>PACQUIAO HAS HAD</b> a career full of surprises inside the squared circle. A diminutive teenager who turned pro in 1995, Pacquiao made an unlikely ascent from 112 to 154 pounds and routinely proved the skeptics wrong during one of the most impressive stretches in boxing history as he collected world titles in a blistering display of offensive firepower.</p><p>For his fight with Barrios, Pacquiao will return to a familiar place where he made his American debut on short notice and offered his first of many surprises when he upset Ledwaba. He also pulverized Miguel Cotto, throttled Oscar De La Hoya and showed Father Time who the boss was when he beat Thurman, all at MGM Grand Garden Arena.</p><p>\"I love making history there,\" Pacquiao said. \"I have so many great memories and I never imagined after 24 years that I would come back to the MGM to win another world title. That's nothing but a blessing from God.\"</p><p>What the future holds for Pacquiao after Saturday could also be a surprise. Should he make history again, would Pacquiao be comfortable riding off into the sunset, or is this the beginning of yet another improbable chapter of his career?</p><p>\"It's hard to say what tomorrow holds,\" Pacquiao said after a long pause. \"I always leave it to God, and he gave me the chance to fight again. But if my body feels strong after this fight ...\"</p><p>He stopped himself short of committing to another fight. But if we know anything about Pacquiao, it's that he is still full of surprises.</p>\n</div></div>"

A team also has the inability to trade their first-round pick seven years out if they finish over the second apron. And that same first also could be moved back to the end of the round if a team finishes over the second apron in three out of four seasons.</p><p>However, there are no rules that prohibit a team from retaining their own players.

Here is why:</p><p>Oklahoma City has positioned itself to spend in the future. Since the 2020-21 season, Oklahoma City has had the fifth-lowest cumulative payroll. For the sixth straight season, the Thunder will not pay a luxury tax penalty. In addition to projected revenue from expansion, OKC will have another revenue stream in the future, as its new arena opens in 2028. (The Thunder's new arena will be funded 90% by the public.)</p><p>The apron restrictions, as designed, work to take away the tools a front office has to improve the roster via free agency and trades. But unlike other high-spending teams, Oklahoma City has 13 first-round and 16 seconds in the next seven years. Four of those firsts could be in the 2026 draft alone. The Thunder have the option to offset the cost of the roster with players on rookie-scale contracts. Two examples are <a data-player-guid=\"d4609779-e07b-36a5-910e-bc4a44a46013\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5159925/nikola-topic\">Nikola Topic</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"662a5a94-8cf3-33c4-8d91-f950cae85e12\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5061603/thomas-sorber\">Thomas Sorber</a>, first-round picks in the past two seasons.</p><p>The Celtics have two players on supermax contracts (Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum), while the Thunder have only one: Gilgeous-Alexander, whose supermax extension does not even begin until the 2027-28 season. That means that for the next two seasons (and also previous two years) the current MVP will play on a salary that is less than 25% of the cap.</p><p>Holmgren's and Williams' extensions start at 25% of the salary cap in 2026-27, $16 million less per year than a supermax. The Thunder have also protected themselves in case either player earns regular-season honors.</p><p>Unlike <a data-player-guid=\"b121848a-30d3-3fad-b6ab-74bf04005533\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432573/paolo-banchero\">Paolo Banchero</a>'s extension with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"74c23102-8c27-c8e6-ec1b-8a8fd4d42554\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic</a> that includes a 30% escalator (his $239 million extension increases to $287 million) if named All-NBA, MVP or Defensive Player of the Year, Holmgren does not have that in his contract. Williams' salary next season increases to the same amount as Banchero's, but only if he is named MVP, Defensive Player of the Year or All-NBA first-team. There are escalators for being named second- or third-team, but at a lesser percentage.</p><p>Most importantly, the Thunder have staggered their contracts for the next five seasons.

However, Parsons isn't worried about a long-term deal getting done despite training camp getting set to open later this month.</p><p>\"I just work harder.

You got to show people your value. I just think that's the difference. Like I go, OK, bet, and I just work.\"</p><p>Parson certainly understands his value considering that the Pro Bowl pass rusher has tallied at least 12 sacks in each of his four seasons. He's also been named to the Pro Bowl on four occasions, earned two First Team All-Pro selections, and was the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2021.</p><p>In total, Parsons has registered 52.5 sacks, 256 tackles, and nine forced fumbles since being selected with the No. 12 pick in the 2021 <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>.</p><p>\"I'm just going to get mine no matter what,\" Parsons said. \"You know what I mean? Like, the markets change every year. Their salary cap went up, like, another 18% this year. So, if you want to know contracts, all the contracts are based off of percentage. Like, each player, a high-paid player, takes a percentage of the salary cap. So, it's not really the number. It goes off by the salary cap.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Parsons certainly isn't the only high-profile pass rusher that is looking for a new deal ahead of the 2025 season. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071793/t-j-watt/\">T.J.

However, Parsons isn't worried about other pass rushers around the league and believes every situation is different.</p><p>\"They numbers got nothing to do with mine, and my numbers ain't got nothing to do with them,\" Parsons said regarding the market at his position. \"Like, I'm younger than Hendrickson. I mean, Hutchinson's coming off an injury. Everyone's circumstances is completely different. Hutch is coming off his third year. Usually guys wait four years. So, it just all depends. Watt. I mean, he's up there with Myles. So, you know, it's different. Everyone's circumstance is different.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Parson has taken part in offseason workouts with the Cowboys rather than holding out in the hopes of getting a deal done. The Cowboys have been busy extending some of their top players over the last calendar year. The team signed quarterback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a> to a four-year, $240 million contract extension, while also inking star wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lamb/\">CeeDee Lamb</a> to a four-year, $136 million deal in 2024.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

The Irishman won his only career major at The Open in 2019, and despite being a 30-1 longshot in the latest 2025 Open Championship odds, the model sees value in featuring Lowry in 2025 Open Championship picks on&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a></span>. Lowry will likely have plenty of supporters behind him with the final major of the year taking place in Northern Ireland, so if you're a fan of playing longshots when online sports betting, the model views Lowry as one to target for 2025 Open Championship bets.</p><p>A major field brings out the best in the world, and Scottie Scheffler is the +450 favorite in the latest 2025 Open Championship odds. He's followed by Rory McIlroy (+700), Jon Rahm (+1200) and Bryson DeChambeau (+2000) with the next lowest odds to win the Open Championship 2025. Along with being listed at +3000 odds to win at FanDuel Sportsbook, Lowry is +250 to finish in the top 10 and +115 to finish in the top 20 at Royal Portrush.</p><p>Now that the 2025 Open Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and revealed its longshot betting picks.

But with five top-10 finishes, including a runner-up at the Travelers Championship on June 22, over 15 PGA Tour events this year, Fleetwood is playing some of the most competitive golf of his career. He's finished fourth or better in three of his last seven tournaments, and the 34-year-old is fourth on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained this year.</p><p>The Englishman has a successful history at Royal Portrush Golf Club, finishing second at the 2019 Open Championship. The Englishman has three top-10 results over his last five Open Championship events at a tournament that font means even more to Europeans such as Fleetwood. Fleetwood has at least one top-five result at a major in six of the prior seven years (outside of 2020), which he hasn't achieved this year yet. But given Fleetwood is playing a course he has a strong history at, the model sees value in Fleetwood for 2025 Open Championship bets. DraftKings is offering the best odds on Fleetwood at 28-1, and the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings promo code</a></span> instantly gives new users $150 in bonus bets after making their first $5 bet.&nbsp;</p><h2>Shane Lowry (30-1)</h2><p>Fleetwood's 2019 second-place finish at Royal Portrush came behind Lowry's victory as the 2019 Open Champion looks to win back-to-back majors held at this Northern Ireland course. Lowry had a dominant victory in 2019, winning by six strokes, and that course success could carry over six years later. The 38-year-old missed the cut in the last two majors this year, but the Irishman will have much of the crowd behind him for the European major less than 200 miles from his home county.</p><p>Lowry finished sixth at last year's Open Championship for his second top-six result at a major in 2024. He's finished in the top 25 in 13 of his last 19 majors, including three top-12 results over his last five Open Championships. He's 13th on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained, highlighted by ranking third in strokes gained: Approach to Green, and he's third in proximity. Strong approach shots can put Lowry in a position to repeat his success from 2019 at Royal Portrush, and at 30-1 odds on FanDuel, the model sees value in this play. You can also use the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">FanDuel promo code</a></span> to receive $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins.&nbsp;</p><h2>Justin Thomas (55-1)</h2><p>The 32-year-old is fourth in the FedEx Cup standings as the former No. 1 ranked golfer is performing closer to his once elite status. Thomas has a victory and two runner-up results over his last nine PGA Tour events. His RBC Heritage victory on April 20 snapped a nearly 36-month winless streak. Despite going nearly three full years without a victory, Thomas still has 16 career PGA Tour wins, including two majors, as he competes in his ninth Open Championship.</p><p>Thomas finished T-11 at the 2019 Open Championships at Royal Portrush Golf Club. He's made the cut in 14 of 16 PGA Tour events this year. However, he has missed the cut at seven of his last 11 majors, but the model views his price dropping to more than 50-1 odds as an overreaction to that. Thomas is having one of the best putting seasons on the PGA Tour, ranking first in birdie average and putting average, and some timely putts can move him toward the top of the 2025 Open Championship leaderboard. You can bet on Thomas at bet365, where you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slc.cbssports.com/clickout/visitDirectLink?st=cbs&amp;op=bet365&amp;type=sport&amp;d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bet365.com%2Fhub%2Faff%2Fapp-hero-banner-1%3Faffiliate%3D365_03354659&amp;clickoutElement=cbssports-single-prism&amp;pt=cbssports-single-prism&amp;sid=e11240a0-7ddb-4e48-84f7-d230a0626425--9bdf\" target=\"_blank\">bet $5 and get $150 in bonus bets, win or lose</a>:</p><h2>More 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>You've seen the latest longshots from the model.

Carter has played two fewer seasons and had lesser production in 2024 than Odighizuwa, but the chasm between the two players' perception couldn't be wider.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter ranked third on the list with some people voting him as high as No. 1 and no lower than No. 4. Odighizuwa totaled more quarterback pressures (60 to 53), a higher quarterback pressure rate (12.3% to 10.4%) and the same number of sacks (4.5) in 2024. Yes, contributing to the reigning <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> LIX champion <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> helped Carter's credibility, but on a list of individual rankings, a player's individual statistics should be weighed the most heavily.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps weight is another factor holding Odighizuwa back. Carter is a behemoth, standing at 6-foot-3 while weighing 300 pounds. Odighizuwa is just an inch shorter at 6-foot-2, but he's stylistically more of a finesse player who relies on his athleticism given his playing weight of 280.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Jalen Carter vs. Osa Odighizuwa (2024 season)</th><th>Jalen Carter (PHI)</th><th>Osa Odighizuwa (DAL)</th></tr><tr><td><p>QB Pressures</p></td><td><p>53</p></td><td><p>60</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>QB Pressure Rate</p></td><td><p>10.4%</p></td><td><p>12.3%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sacks</p></td><td><p>4.5</p></td><td><p>4.5</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-biggest-training-camp-battle-touches-at-rb-position-up-for-grabs-between-veteran-and-rookies/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Cowboys' biggest training camp battle?

The scheme Dallas used in 2024 leaned more on its linebackers to be playmakers; the scheme Eberflus will run in 2025 returns some of that playmaking onus back to the defensive line.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I'm very comfortable with it. I love it,\" Odighizuwa told CBS Sports on the last day of mandatory minicamp on June 12. \"I'm just very excited to play in it. It's going to be a good year. I like what [Eberflus] got going on. I like the vibe that him and Schotty have. I feel I learned pretty fast, like adjusting to different things. I feel like it hasn't been too much of an adjustment because a lot of the things that I'm being asked to do just align with my skillset really well. So it's more so just learning the X's and O's, which I feel like I pick up on pretty quickly.\"</p><p>Odighizuwa produced career highs in sacks (4.5) and quarterback pressures (60) in Zimmer's scheme, but now that he's evolved as a player over the last couple of seasons, he's better positioned to maximize his abilities and turn them into larger on-field production in a scheme suited to highlight the way he plays.&nbsp;</p><p>What that will look like on the field is Dallas' defense getting back to more pre- and post-snap movement along the defensive line with twists and stunts. That's a style of play more aligned with what Dan Quinn -- the Cowboys defensive coordinator for Odighizuwa's first three seasons (2021-2023) who is now the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a>&nbsp;head coach -- ran in Dallas than what Zimmer emphasized in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Translation: Odighizuwa could very well be ranked a lot higher amongst his peers at this time next year.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I feel like, it's not just me, I feel like it's a scheme that requires the D-line to eat,\" Odighizuwa said. \"It's just not one where it's set up for us to eat. If the D-line doesn't eat, the scheme isn't going to work. You know what I mean? ... Definitely a lot more similarities with DQ's defense. Just more, not to say we move a bunch, just like more stunts, more twists, stuff like that. It just favors more athletic DTs and more athletic defensive linemen in general. It's a defense that requires you to have very athletic defensive linemen.\" &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

If the game gets to  the 12th, then they could have a swing-off. I know purists would scream,  but there has to be a mechanism to end the game at some point in this  era of so many pitcher injuries. I'm good with leaving the runner on  second and not doing this, but could be talked into the swing-off in the  12th or 13th or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>R.J. Anderson:</strong> I guess I would be fine with it after the 11th or 12th inning. I don't  mind the current setup, though, and I do wonder if people would miss it,  given it's a closer approximation of the actual game, once the novelty  wore off the swing-off aspect. I will acknowledge the pitcher injury  aspect is a fair consideration.  </p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Mike Axisa:</strong> Nah. Leave it with the All-Star Game. There is one extra-innings game every 11 games league-wide, give or take, so at least one a night, usually. The novelty will wear off quickly. The magic that happened during the All-Star Game was organic and you can't recreate that. I do think a swing-off is more entertaining than the automatic runner in extra innings. I just want baseball games to be decided by baseball players, not the first base coach throwing BP. The All-Star Game was extremely fun Tuesday. Let's leave the swing-off where it is, and not give baseball its version of a shootout.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div>\n\n    </div></div>"

However, Fleetwood is a seven-time DP World Tour winner, and a return to Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, where he finished second to Shane Lowry in 2019, might be just what he needs. He's +2600 in the 2025 Open Championship odds, but he could accomplish two career firsts -- his first major and PGA Tour-sanctioned victories -- with a win.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lowry is also a +3500 longshot in his return to Royal Portrush, and his good friend Rory McIlroy, who is from Northern Ireland, is listed at +700.

A former world No. 1, Spieth's game has had its ups and downs since he burst onto the scene with a runner-up finish at the Masters in 2014 and then a win in 2015, but he's been trending in the right direction for a few months.</p><p>He fell all the way to 84th in the Official World Golf Ranking in February but has since posted four top-10 finishes and climbed to as high as 44th before a neck injury forced him to withdraw from the Travelers Championship.

We've had great, great players. [Cooper Flagg], in his freshman year, is definitely the best freshman that has ever played.\"</p><p>Powerful words from a legend who won five national titles and is widely viewed as the greatest men's college basketball coach since John Wooden.</p><p>But do his former players agree? Where does Flagg slot into an all-time rotation of Blue Devils after a single season in Durham, North Carolina?</p><p>We tried to answer those questions. It wasn't easy to compile Duke's all-time roster, strictly based on collegiate accomplishments. But we've managed it.</p><p>This was a complicated exercise that considered multiple generations of talent: 53 former Duke players who were selected in the first round of their respective NBA drafts since the 1985-1986 season. The pool also featured elite those who wouldn't qualify due to limited playing time, but still warrant acknowledgment. (We'll never know what Kyrie Irving -- 17.5 PPG, 46% from 3 in 11 games in 2010-11 -- might have done had he not been out most of the season with a toe injury.)</p><p>We polled Duke players for their opinions. We also studied candidates' statistical impact and performance on a national level. And, we looked not just at sheer dominance of the game but how they stood out best.</p><p>We also decided not to build this roster by position, to fit today's positionless game.</p><p>The goal, ultimately, was to create a balanced roster. Would the three- and four-year players of older generations have stayed as long in the one-and-done era -- and racked up the same accomplishments? Can you imagine four years of Cooper Flagg or <a data-player-guid=\"34e5ec5d-10b3-ba59-2ba1-3a3be9a1be22\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson\">Zion Williamson</a>, who had seasons few Duke players can match?</p><p>As for Flagg: He was the most polarizing candidate.</p><p>Some former Duke players didn't believe he deserved inclusion.</p><p>\"Certainly a consideration, but I'm not sure one year is enough for any player to crack the all-time top five at Duke,\" said Jay Bilas, an ESPN analyst and former Duke standout. \"I'd guess that would be the same at UCLA, UNC and UConn.\"</p><p>A member of the 1994 team that lost to Arkansas in the national title game agreed. \"He would not be in my all-time starting five,\" he said. \"He's a great player in his one year of college. But there were too many guys from that program that did so much that I would not put him over them.\"</p><p>\"No ring, no starting five,\" added a Duke star who won national titles in 1991 and 1992. \"In that regard, he probably falls into the Kyrie category. I can no way in my right mind pick [Flagg] over Grant Hill at [small forward].\"</p><p>Others disagreed.</p><p>\"I think at power forward you can make an argument for Flagg, especially how the game is played now,\" said a key member of Duke's 2001 national title team.</p><p>A member of the 2010 title-winning team made the distinction between Flagg's talents and his achievements.</p><p>\"He is a top-five talent and player all-time at Duke, likely top-two,\" said a player who helped the Blue Devils win the 2010 national championship. \"All-time starting five? I would probably say Flagg is the sixth man [because he lacks the team achievements]. If I had to pick a top five, however, it would be hard to keep him out.\"</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Starting five</h2><h2><a data-player-guid=\"7e9132e3-70a4-7858-ee37-ea5f23a03a5e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1733/jay-williams\">Jay Williams</a>, point guard (1999-2002)</h2><p><em>19.3 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 6.0 APG, 39.3% 3PT%</em></p><p>Per the former Duke players who spoke to ESPN, the point guard spot drew the most controversy. But Williams gets the nod here with a pair of AP first-team All-America efforts. He also anchored Duke's run to the 2001 national championship and won the Wooden Award a year later.</p><p>Williams also passed the eye test. Few players in college basketball have possessed his combination of explosiveness, speed and overall talent. At 6-foot-2, he might be the best player, pound for pound, in Duke history.</p><hr><h2>Christian Laettner, power forward/center (1989-92)</h2><p><em>16.6 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 48.5% 3PT%</em></p><p>Any list of Duke's greatest players -- the greatest players in college basketball history, too -- is void without Laettner. He led the Blue Devils to three consecutive national title game appearances, winning two of them. He also won the 1992 Wooden Award. His greatest accomplishment, however, may have been joining the national men's team (The Dream Team) that won the Olympic gold medal in 1992.</p><p>But Laettner also altered the perceptions of his position well beyond his years in college. Today, big men are allowed to do everything on the court, which wasn't the case in the early 1990s. Laettner was a 6-11 star who evolved into an unguardable, multifaceted threat. (He shot nearly 56% from 3 as a senior.) He was also one of just two unanimous picks for inclusion among the players polled.</p><hr><h2>Grant Hill, small forward/shooting guard (1990-94)</h2><p><em>14.9 PPG, 6.0 RPG, 3.6 APG, 37.6% 3PT%</em></p><p>If we had built this roster by position, the small forward slot would have been a competition between Hill and Flagg -- and Hill would have won. He's one of the most versatile and accomplished players in Duke history, helping the Blue Devils reach three national title games and cutting down the nets twice -- the third was that 1994 loss to Arkansas.</p><p>Hill ended his collegiate career with a breathtaking senior run in which he averaged 17.4 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 5.2 APG, 1.9 SPG, 1.2 BPG and 39% from the 3-point line, and was named an AP first-team All-American. The players we polled for this exercise didn't agree on much, but they all agreed: Grant Hill had to be in the starting five.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,26397115\" data-cerebro-id=\"5c9f81adca84b70f2e2e9d1e\" data-title=\"Bilas: Grant Hill, not Zion, is Duke's best player ever\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2019%2F0330%2Fdm_190330_Zion_gameday%2Fdm_190330_Zion_gameday.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2019%2F0330%2Fdm_190330_Zion_gameday%2Fdm_190330_Zion_gameday.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2019%2F0330%2Fdm_190330_Zion_gameday%2Fdm_190330_Zion_gameday.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"26397115\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Bilas: Grant Hill, not Zion, is Duke's best player ever</p><p>Jay Bilas says Grant Hill is Duke's best player ever and Christian Laettner is the most accomplished, but Zion Williamson is in the discussion.</p></div></div><hr><h2>Zion Williamson, power forward (2018-19)</h2><p><em>22.6 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 2.1 APG, 2.1 SPG, 1.8 BPG, 33.8% 3PT%</em></p><p>Krzyzewski once called Williamson \"the most unique athlete\" he had ever coached.

Battier won the Wooden Award and Final Four Most Outstanding Player in 2001, the year he led the Blue Devils to Krzyzewski's third national title. He was also one of the best defenders in college basketball history. In any other circumstance, Battier's résumé would make him an all-time starter.</p><hr><h2>Johnny Dawkins, point guard (1982-86)</h2><p><em>19.2 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 4.2 APG, 35.2% 3PT%</em></p><p>You could make a strong case that Dawkins is the reason Krzyzewski didn't lose his job following a rocky first chapter at Duke. Dawkins' 1985-86 campaign -- when he led the program to the national title game and won Naismith Player of the Year -- altered the trajectory of the program, inspiring the future top prospects who would fuel the team's run in the 1990s.</p><hr><h2>JJ Redick, shooting guard (2002-06)</h2><p><em>19.9 PPG, 2.2 APG, 40.6% 3PT%</em></p><p>It doesn't feel good to leave the program's all-time leading scorer off the all-time starting five.

Redick had the best four-year run of any former Duke star (two-time AP first-team All-American, Wooden Award) who didn't win a national title. That's the only blemish on his résumé.</p><hr><h2><a data-player-guid=\"a7277d7b-12de-9835-7d91-d1374d3be50b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/361/bobby-hurley\">Bobby Hurley</a>, point guard (1989-93)</h2><p><em>12.4 PPG, 7.7 APG, 40.5% 3PT%</em></p><p>Let's be clear: Hurley and Dawkins could each make a strong case as the starting point guard for Duke's all-time squad -- if not for Jay Williams. Hurley helped the Blue Devils win back-to-back national titles in 1991 and 1992 and was an AP All-America first-teamer in 1993. He was the quarterback of one of college basketball's most dominant stretches by a single team.</p><hr><h2>Elton Brand, power forward/center (1997-99)</h2><p><em>16.2 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 61.2% 2PT%</em></p><p>He will always be the face of what was perhaps the greatest college team that failed to win a national title: the 1998-99 Blue Devils, who won 32 straight games before falling to UConn in the national championship. That team, however, had five future NBA lottery picks. Brand, who won the Wooden Award for that campaign, was the best player on the team.</p><p><strong>Honorable mentions:</strong> <a data-player-guid=\"7d647d40-651d-047a-204a-7b248737221a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277848/marvin-bagley-iii\">Marvin Bagley III</a>, Jon Scheyer, <a data-player-guid=\"ed3343b0-2ffa-f6b4-e422-3a1920938c81\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum\">Jayson Tatum</a>, Shelden Williams, <a data-player-guid=\"facc698c-2cf8-366d-a970-b4f34d098299\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/5259519/jabari-parker\">Jabari Parker</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"b121848a-30d3-3fad-b6ab-74bf04005533\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432573/paolo-banchero\">Paolo Banchero</a>, Gene Banks, Jahlil Okafor, <a data-player-guid=\"92d6ee44-1fcc-f058-5b21-9c8dc7d2efde\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395625/rj-barrett\">RJ Barrett</a>, Danny Ferry</p>\n</div></div>"

Castellanos led all FBS quarterbacks with 13 rushing touchdowns during the 2023 campaign but left Boston College in November 2024 after losing the starting job.

McIlroy completed the coveted Grand Slam with his dramatic victory at the Masters in April. That was his sixth major victory, but arguably the most satisfying of his career. The Northern Ireland native finally got his first green jacket and completed his career grand slam on his 17th attempt at Augusta.</p><p>McIlroy also won the Open Championship in 2014, but he has been hit or miss at this major in recent years. In fact, McIlroy has finished T-46 or worse in three of his last five starts at The Open, which includes missing the cut at Royal Portrush in 2019. &nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>The model has also locked in its projection for Scottie Scheffler, who is now a three-time major champion after winning the PGA Championship earlier this year. He's unquestionably the best player in the world right now after piling up 16 wins on the PGA Tour since Feb. 2022, but he has had a few difficulties in the Open Championship. He hasn't cracked the top five in any of his four starts in golf's oldest major and was outside the top 20 twice.</p><p>However, he has been inside the top 25 in all four of his Open Championship starts and was top 10 twice, including a career-best t-7th finish last year at Royal Troon. He's top 25 in all four major strokes gained categories on the PGA Tour this season and his improvements to his all-around game, particularly his putting, are a big reason why he could finally be a factor in an Open Championship. Scheffler is -110 to finish in the top 5 and -220 to finish in the top 10.</p><p>The model has also locked in its projection for Bryson DeChambeau, who is a two-time major champion who also had top-five finishes in both this year's Masters and PGA Championship. DeChambeau wasn't able to maintain his top-five streak at last month's U.S. Open as he missed the cut after winning the major a year ago. Nonetheless, he's been on quite a run over his last seven major starts as he has five finishes in the top six.</p>\n        \n\n<p>DeChambeau collected his 14th professional win in May in South Korea, but success has been fleeting at this specific major tournament. The Open is the only that he's never recorded a top 5 at, and he only has one top 25 over his seven British Open starts. DeChambeau missed the cut in 2019 when The Open was last at Royal Portrush, shooting 5-over-par and finishing four strokes back of the cut line. Thus, he'll look to lean more on recent results, both in majors and this season, rather than his history at The Open Championship.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-picks-odds-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-predictions-for-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-and-others/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipNames\" target=\"_blank\">See the full Open Championship projections from the model here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship  picks</h2><p>The model is targeting targeting five golfers with odds of 28-1 or longer to make a strong run up the leaderboard, including a monster 50-1 longshot. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-picks-odds-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-predictions-for-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-and-others/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipNames\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see the model's picks here</a>.</p><p><strong>Who will win the 2025 Open Championship, which longshots will stun the golfing world, and where will Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau finish?

In some circles, the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> were said to have reached for him. He debuted just a year later and joined a playoff team in 2015 as a big-time power guy. He hit moonshot homers in the playoffs and become a cult hero in Wrigleyville. He tore his ACL in the first week of the 2016 season, but returned to DH in the World Series and etched his name forever in Fall Classic lore. He was a champion. Then a leadoff hitter. Then a minor-leaguer. Then a power stud again. The Cubs non-tendered him. The Nationals traded him at midseason for a minor-league pitcher who last appeared in the Mexican Pacific Winter League.</p><p>Today, Schwarber is a three-time All-Star. He was Tuesday night's <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/kyle-schwarber-named-mlb-all-star-game-mvp-phillies-slugger-leads-national-league-to-thrilling-swing-off-win/\" target=\"_blank\">All-Star Game MVP</a></span>, thanks to an <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/2025-mlb-all-star-game-score-national-league-wins-on-wild-home-run-derby-style-swing-off-tiebreaker/live/\" target=\"_blank\">exhilarating swing-off that gave the National League a rare win</a>.</p><p>At this point, he's a seasoned veteran. He's 1,225 games into his <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> career and ranks fifth in WAR from players taken in the first round of the 2014 Draft. He's first, by a lot, in home runs. In fact, with 314 career homers at age 32, dare we dream that Schwarber could get all the way to 500 in his career? Using Bill James' favorite projection, Schwarber will end with 462 career homers with a 30% chance to reach 500. Even if he fell short of 500, only 39 players in history have hit 462 home runs. Schwarber's already 146th on the all-time list.</p><p>Schwarber is, of course, more than just the home runs. He has an excellent eye at the plate and routinely is among the league leaders in walks. He's a thoughtful hitter, but he also swings harder than most. His career .346 on-base percentage is better than league average since he debuted by a decent margin (the league average OBP this season is .315, for example). He's pacing toward his fifth season with more than 90 RBI and third with more than 100.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Still, Schwarber's best asset is his ability to stack up the home runs. After all, it is the best possible thing a hitter can do in any given plate appearance. He leads the Phillies this season with 30, more than double Nick Castellanos' second-place total of 12.</p><p>He's certainly a slugger, but that isn't necessarily all he is.&nbsp;</p><p>\"It's a great question,\" he told CBS Sports asked if he considers himself a slugger. \"I don't know. I mean, I would say that I would like to be known as more than just a guy who hits home runs. That's kind of been the grain that I've been working against. Obviously, home runs are great and if I can keep doing that and producing runs that's awesome, too, but I also want to be able to come up in situations and be able to come up with situational hits different than a home run.\"&nbsp;</p><p>He's been fighting the stigma that a \"slugger\" is someone who can only hit home runs and can't really do much else. A Rob Deer type or even Dave Kingman. Schwarber, though, is good enough at controlling the strike zone that the Phillies sometimes have him hit leadoff. Sure, he gets on base at a good clip, as noted, but still, we're talking about a guy who has hit 46 and 47 homers in a season before and is very likely to get in the same ballpark again this year. But he's hit leadoff 513 times, more than any other spot in the batting order. The second-highest total for a spot in the lineup is 153 in the two-hole.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>For Schwarber, it doesn't matter where he hits.</p><p>\"To be honest with you, I don't care,\" he said. \"I just want to be playing. I've done it all. There was a year I hit 1-9 in the order. I just want to be playing and at the end of the day, it's about winning.</p><p>\"Whatever the manager thinks is the best lineup for the game that day, that's what I'm gonna do.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Leadoff, cleanup, it doesn't matter to his approach.</p><p>\"It's the same. It's more situational, the situation dictates it. That's the way I like to view it,\" Schwarber said. \"Like, say, two quick outs for this guy pitching, then you might take that first pitch. We might try to work the count a little bit longer. Guy on third base, infield's back, I'm trying to make contact early and not being too selective in trying to hit. Things like that, the game situation dictates what I'm trying to do.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Much of the time, though, he's attempting to do some serious damage to the baseball. After all, that's what he does best. Can he do it enough to get to 500? That's long been a benchmark to immortality and even a ticket to Cooperstown for most. Can he get there? Has he even thought about it?&nbsp;</p><p>\"I mean, if it happens, it happens and it would be great,\" he said. \"The best words of advice I've ever gotten came from <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/580589/jon-lester/\">Jon Lester</a>: 'To get paid or to be remembered, the best way to be known is to win.' That's stuck with me in my head since 2015 and I try to focus on doing that. If you're associated with winning that means you're probably doing something good.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Schwarber has won. He's homered in every single round of the playoffs in both leagues. He's been to the postseason nine times, playing in two World Series and winning it once. He has hit 21 home runs in 69 playoff games. The All-Star Game swing-off will go down in the annals of MLB history.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Schwarber may be more than just a home run hitter at the plate, but he sure does make his mark with the long ball. Maybe that gets him to the Hall of Fame. Maybe it just keeps helping him win.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

In a fairly even group, they did enough with a draw, win and loss. However, their second-place finish means they were drawn against the winners of Group B (Spain) and therefore have the toughest quarterfinal draw. Their chances of winning against the world champions are slim, but the country has really got behind the team this summer, so they'll be motivated to cause an upset.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/464.png\" width=\"40\"></p><h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/2762/norway\" target=\"_blank\">NORWAY</a></h2><p>Norway navigated the group stage fairly comfortably, with three wins from three, but the rest of the tournament is unlikely to be so forgiving. We have to give the edge to Italy in their upcoming quarterfinal, though a place in the semifinals isn't out of the question for a nation with a proud history in European Championships (two-time winners and four-time runners-up, most recently in 2013).</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/466.png\" width=\"40\"></p><h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/2764/sweden\" target=\"_blank\">SWEDEN</a></h2><p>This quarterfinal is unlikely to mirror the Euro 2022 semifinal that saw Sweden lose 4-0 to England. They are a seasoned team, who scored four against Germany, and won all three of their group games. But facing the reigning champions is not the draw that Sweden wanted, so it will be a tough ask for them to make the last four.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/481.png\" width=\"40\"></p><h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/2756/germany\" target=\"_blank\">GERMANY</a></h2><p>Germany looked confident until their final group game, where it all fell apart after a costly red card in a 4-1 defeat to Sweden. Now they find themselves on the tougher side of the bracket, facing France next and then the winner of Spain vs. Switzerland. That means they'll need to get past two of the world's top-ranked sides just to reach the final. Their quarterfinal against France is hard to call, with both teams evenly matched, but the prospect of meeting Spain next in the semis puts Germany lower in the rankings.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/478.png\" width=\"40\"></p><h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/2755/france\" target=\"_blank\">FRANCE</a></h2><p>Topping Group D hasn't guaranteed France an easy route to the final and finishing second would have offered them a more favorable draw. Despite cruising comfortably through the group stage with three wins from three, upsetting England in the opening game, France now face a daunting path. They'll need to overcome Germany and, if successful, will likely then have to contend with Spain next. Like Germany, it makes their progression to the final far from certain.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/162.png\" width=\"40\"></p><h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/2792/italy\" target=\"_blank\">ITALY</a></h2><p>Arguably, the <em>Azzure </em>have the most favorable quarterfinal matchup. By finishing second in Group B, they now face the winners of Group A, a group that featured four lower-ranked teams. With Norway as their quarterfinal opponents, they have a strong chance of reaching the semifinal, though a likely meeting with the winner of England vs Sweden would present a much tougher obstacle. Still, making it to the semifinal would mark Italy's best tournament performance this century and they have beaten Germany and Spain in recent years... so anything is possible.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/448.png\" width=\"40\"></p><h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/5159/england\" target=\"_blank\">ENGLAND</a></h2><p>After their opening loss to France, the conversation around England was whether they'd even make it out of the group stage. But following their emphatic 4-0 win over Netherlands, the narrative quickly shifted to talk of them going all the way. Finishing second in the group actually turned out to be an advantage as it placed them on the easier side of the draw, with Sweden first and then either Italy or Norway in the semis, as they avoided both eight-time champions Germany and reigning world champions Spain. Thanks to the bracket, the defending champions now have a genuine shot at reaching another final.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/soccer/500/164.png\" width=\"40\"></p><h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/17640/spain\" target=\"_blank\">SPAIN</a></h2><p>With three convincing wins from three games, it's no surprise Spain remain favorites for the title. They cruised into the quarterfinals, but their path is far from simple. Hosts Switzerland will be roared on by the home support, and a potential semifinal against the winner of France vs. Germany promises to be challenging. Still, this Spain side have shown they can beat anyone on their day and look well placed to finally claim the one trophy that has eluded them.</p>\n</div></div>"

It was standing-room only at England's spectacular base at the opulent Dolder Grand hotel just outside the hubbub of Zurich when she spoke to the media on Tuesday. She reflected on triumphs past, hope of glory in the future but also the size of the task facing England right now.</p><p>The teams have played each other twice since, both matches ending in draws with Sweden the unluckier. So England are under no illusions about the size of task. A group of the Lionesses, including Williamson, watched Sweden's 4-1 dismantling of Germany on Saturday and they came away impressed. \"I do think Sweden deserve a little bit more recognition,\" Williamson said.</p><p>In the Sweden camp, they have been training in far more ordinary surroundings, away from the UEFA recommended list. They're at a fitness centre in Cham, a town 30 kilometres north of Zurich, called \"On Your Mark.\" The rooms are minimalist, and the facilities not as extravagant. But Sweden prioritised ease: the players walk from their facilities onto the training pitch, where <a data-player-guid=\"90bc2c10-6dc6-50a6-8ba6-d1279ab6a1ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/255181/nathalie-bjorn\">Nathalie Björn</a> will have a playlist ready for them. They still have the customary pool table, golf simulator and other distractions -- but the ice rink is off-limits.</p><p>That's not to say the whole setup hasn't had its teething problems, like assistant coach Magnus Wilkman having a room next to building work. \"I have a construction site in the living room, an angle grinder in the kitchen and a crane that is controlled from the headboard,\" he said. \"They start working at a quarter past five every morning. If you open the blinds, you can shake hands with the guy in the crane.\"</p><p>England will be well aware how hard this game will be. Sweden took the bronze medal in the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/league/_/name/fifa.wwc\" target=\"_blank\">Women's World Cup</a> (including knocking out the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"cb9be884-d621-f46a-952e-7f9ef155cad5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2765\">United States</a> on penalties in the round of 16) and they are on a 16-match unbeaten run. At Euro 2025, Sweden are three wins from three, sealed by that dominant victory over Germany which secured top spot in the group and a date at the Stadion Letzigrund.</p><p>Peter Gerhardsson is still the head coach, thought this fourth major tournament in charge of the <em>Blågult </em>will be his last. But this is a very different Sweden side.</p><p>Sweden have four players under the age of 25, compared to two in 2023.

She's a great player and she has been for many years now. Her experience speaks for itself.\"</p><p>The defence is anchored by Björn and Eriksson, who missed their first two matches, with <a data-player-guid=\"972f947a-a66e-7bde-c47b-1c66be26d5e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/255177/jennifer-falk\">Jennifer Falk</a> in goal (<a data-player-guid=\"cf2074a4-d945-1ec6-cda8-b0f9ce491ed5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/255417/zecira-musovic\">Zecira Musovic</a> was first choice but announced in February she is pregnant.)</p><p>England know the threats and they are anticipating plenty of battles in the air. \"Definitely, it's one of their main threats,\" Williamson said. \"And they are good at it and it's something that we've had a look at. Obviously you want to try to stop the crosses, but we are all prepared for the battle in the air.\"</p><p>On Sweden's physicality, Williamson added: \"Again, one of their main strengths I think that comes with discipline. They're great athletes and they produce great athletes as a country. I think we are too. It's a good battle in that sense, but yeah, something that we must be prepared for.\"</p><p><a data-player-guid=\"efd20490-4807-6afa-7e4e-14e7a7fd3c2d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/294255/ella-toone\">Ella Toone</a> has an eye on their transitional play. \"We watched Sweden the other night, they looked really good, a very good counter-attacking team,\" she said.</p><p>England are much-changed since that meeting at the last Euros.

They're just a very organized team. They work hard, we know their characteristics, so it'll be tough.</p><p>\"They work so well together. [They] don't necessarily have to have a crazy standout threat here or there because everybody plays their role. They are hard to prepare for in that sense. Their discipline of wanting to complete the job on the pitch makes them a dangerous side.\"</p><p>In the Sweden camp, there's also a drop of surprise at how they haven't seen their name mentioned in the same breath as other perceived favourites. \"I think you can never count out Sweden in a championship, we have had good results before and everyone knows that,\" Rytting Kaneryd said. \"A championship is special in many ways and we are strong there.</p><p>\"But it's clear, look at <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b40064c7-ecaa-338f-74a8-a3eb43071ec3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=17640\">Spain</a>, they have had absolutely fantastic matches and scored some goals. Now that we've scored four goals against Germany, maybe we will be more dangerous. It doesn't feel like people talk about Sweden that way and I don't know why. We've always been a bit of an underdog. I definitely think teams are starting to notice us and feel like they might not want to face us.\"</p><p>Asllani has hinted this may be her final tournament. Others may follow suit, but this is no \"Last Dance\" for them. Playing for Sweden is addictive for so many, which explains their several centurions.</p><p>And the Swedish fans are enthralled by this run, with the team's allocation of tickets sold out in an hour. Gerhardsson said the support has at times taken his breath away, while the players feed off it. \"We never thought it would be as big as it is,\" Rytting Kaneryd said. \"It's a really good sign that we have the support from Sweden.\"</p><p>There'll be a wall of yellow awaiting England, and the Lionesses will feel the claustrophobia of the <em>Blågult</em>'s support. Amid all the subplots, there's a quarterfinal to win.</p><p>When a manager announces pre-tournament it's to be their final competition, it's rare they'll know in advance when their last match will be. We've already seen two managers bow out in <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"614c2892-68ef-2595-b8ba-1e47a3afd030\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2896\">Denmark</a>'s Andrée Jeglertz and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0a0c383a-529d-d9ee-1a31-cf53c70954ce\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=7151\">Netherlands</a>' Andries Jonker after subpar performances. But Gerhardsson has kept the ship afloat and headed in the right direction. When he does step away, he will remember games like the one in Sheffield, but he hopes the best memory is yet to come.</p><p>\"It didn't go well for us [at Euro 2022] because they scored four goals, but that is history,\" he said. \"Now it is a new game if we are going to meet England. We are going to write a new history, a better history, a good history.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

They're on the covers of video games, they're the talk of TV shows, they're the ones who win awards. The <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> don't end the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a>' reign without <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a>, and the Chiefs never have that reign without <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a>.</p><p>But NFL rosters are 53 players deep for a reason. Throughout a taxing season against opponents with varying strengths and weaknesses, teams need non-stars to step up. If they become stars, that's even better. That's why, with 50 days until the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> visit the Eagles to open the 2025 schedule, we're counting down 50 players who could shape the coming season.</p><p>This is the third year I've done this exercise (2023 <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-training-camps-2023here-are-50-under-the-radar-players-who-could-shape-the-2023-season/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></span>, 2024 <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-season-is-50-days-away-50-under-the-radar-players-who-could-shape-the-2024-season/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></span>), and I'll always hold myself accountable. We've had some hits:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2080032/baker-mayfield/\">Baker Mayfield</a>&nbsp;was expected to be a bridge quarterback for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a>&nbsp;in 2023, only to become much more than that and sign a long-term deal.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a> played better than anyone could have expected last season ... until he didn't. Now, he's the starter in Seattle. Both were on this list for their respective bounce-back seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Other 2024 successes included <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965152/cam-jurgens/\">Cam Jurgens</a> stepping in seamlessly for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1245858/jason-kelce/\">Jason Kelce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251865/tyler-biadasz/\">Tyler Biadasz</a> being the perfect veteran addition ahead of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865693/chuba-hubbard/\">Chuba Hubbard</a> having a breakout campaign.</p>\n        \n\n<p>And \"important\" isn't just for the success stories. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122551/wanya-morris/\">Wanya Morris</a> made the list as the Chiefs' expected left tackle and couldn't hold onto that job, a key part of the Chiefs' undoing in the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3124239/mazi-smith/\">Mazi Smith</a> didn't deliver in his second season as the Cowboys defense struggled.</p><p>We had some swings and misses, too. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131252/curtis-samuel/\">Curtis Samuel</a> made this list as I expected his versatile game to re-emerge after being reunited with Joe Brady. He had a quiet season, but the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a> were just fine. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3129283/luke-musgrave/\">Luke Musgrave</a> got relegated in Green Bay. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2222025/devin-white/\">Devin White</a> never played a snap for the Eagles.</p><p>Now we're back at it again. As always, \"under-the-radar\" is intentionally a loose criterium, but we're adding a few specifics:</p>\n        \n\n<ul><li>Not an All-Pro or Pro Bowler in 2024 or 2023 (we have one exception here, with good reason)</li><li>Not drafted in the first round of the 2025 <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a></li><li>Not in my <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/100-days-until-2025-nfl-kickoff-100-most-important-players-in-upcoming-season/\" target=\"_blank\">100 most important players</a></span> that published 100 days before the season began</li></ul><p>Regarding that last point, that means there are<strong> no projected starting quarterbacks</strong> on this list, the biggest departure from years prior. Starting quarterbacks are, by definition, on the radar. But two of the most undefined quarterback rooms start us off.</p><h2>Quarterback</h2><p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179245/daniel-jones/\">Daniel Jones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a>:</strong> While the Colts would love to see <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163263/anthony-richardson/\">Anthony Richardson</a> perform well enough this offseason to win the job, Jones was actually healthy for minicamp, giving him the lead. Jones has struggled over the past two seasons, ranking 32nd or worse among 34 qualified quarterbacks in yards per attempt, touchdown to interception rate and sack rate, and he has played in just 16 of a possible 34 games over that span. But the Colts nearly made the playoffs last year with a Richardson/Joe Flacco combination and two years ago with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183083/gardner-minshew/\">Gardner Minshew</a>. We'll likely see a decent amount of Jones this year, and if he can keep the offense afloat, it's a win for Indianapolis.</p><p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a>:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26710004/shedeur-sanders/\">Shedeur Sanders</a> got the nod in the 100 most important players, but it's Flacco who won NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 2023 with Cleveland and is a good bet to start in Week 1 over Sanders, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804969/kenny-pickett/\">Kenny Pickett</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a>. Even if/when Flacco gives way to another quarterback, it'll be important for Flacco to provide competent play, something Cleveland did not have last year at all. In a transition year, Cleveland would love to evaluate all parts of its roster, something that was nearly impossible with Deshaun Watson/Jameis Winston/Dorian Thompson-Robinson/Bailey Zappe.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Running back</h2><p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126535/jaylen-warren/\">Jaylen Warren</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Warren's numbers were down significantly from his breakout 2023 in which he recorded 1,154 yards from scrimmage, but his ability to bounce back will be crucial. Warren is a smooth receiver out of the backfield, and that should be much more on display this season with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a> taking over under center after <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1273205/justin-fields/\">Justin Fields</a> shared those responsibilities last year. Furthermore, Warren should see a significant ground workload alongside third-round rookie <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2174994/kaleb-johnson/\">Kaleb Johnson</a>.</p><p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966551/isiah-pacheco/\">Isiah Pacheco</a>, Chiefs:</strong> The Chiefs had several well-noted issues last season, making it all the more remarkable they still made the Super Bowl. The running game, though, was an under-discussed problem. Pacheco missed almost all of the regular season with a broken leg. As a result, Kansas City ranked 30th in explosive rush rate; it was ninth the year before, led by a healthy Pacheco.</p><p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741207/brian-robinson-jr/\">Brian Robinson Jr.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a>:</strong>&nbsp;From Weeks 1-8, Robinson was one of the league's best runners on a success rate and a yards after contact basis. Then he missed Weeks 9 and 10 with a hamstring injury and was among the NFL's least efficient runners thereafter. A Week 12 ankle injury didn't help, either. The change was clear: He avoided 18.8% of tackles from Weeks 1-9. That fell to 11.6% in Weeks 11-18. Washington, once thought of as a landing spot for a top running back in the draft, didn't select one until the seventh round. Robinson will lead the backfield once again.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809206/travis-etienne/\">Travis Etienne</a> Jr., <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a>:</strong> From 2022-23, only three running backs -- <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136743/christian-mccaffrey/\">Christian McCaffrey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061188/derrick-henry/\">Derrick Henry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2257876/josh-jacobs/\">Josh Jacobs</a> -- posted more yards from scrimmage than Etienne. Then Etienne was one of the NFL's biggest disappointments in 2024, and he was eventually passed on his own depth chart by <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162021/tank-bigsby/\">Tank Bigsby</a>. But Etienne is a prime bounce-back candidate. He's just 26 years old, the Jaguars overhauled their interior offensive line, and new head coach Liam Coen crafted an impressive, two-headed rushing attack last year with the Buccaneers.</p><p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28875227/jaydon-blue/\">Jaydon Blue</a>, Cowboys:</strong> Dallas had 27 explosive rushes (12-plus yards) last season, tied for the fourth-fewest in the NFL. Blue, a fifth-round pick, is far from a perfect player, but there's no doubt he's explosive. The Texas product averaged 5.4 yards per carry last season, had a 27.4% missed tackle rate and caught 42 passes. He also ran a 4.38-second 40 yard dash. Blue won't see a ton of touches, but he adds a different element from the rest of the running back room.</p><h2>Wide receivers</h2><p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965372/tutu-atwell/\">Tutu Atwell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>:</strong> The Rams put at least three wide receivers on the field at the second-highest rate in the NFL last year, and after adding <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1893167/davante-adams/\">Davante Adams</a> to pair with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a> this offseason, Los Angeles has a really strong top two. But No. 3? That role falls to Atwell, the diminutive 2021 second-rounder who has increased his receptions, receiving yards and catch rate every season. In his four highest snap-share games, he averaged five catches and 71 receiving yards. He has speed no other player on Los Angeles' offense has.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183982/darius-slayton/\">Darius Slayton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a>:</strong> Slayton seemed to be a trade candidate every season, yet he just stayed in New York and stayed producing. Since Slayton entered the NFL in 2019, he's one of four players who has caught at least 200 passes on at least 15 yards per reception, alongside <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871343/justin-jefferson/\">Justin Jefferson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-brown/\">A.J. Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2082516/mike-williams/\">Mike Williams</a>. Now, on a new contract, he's paired with Russell Wilson, who loves to throw the deep ball. Expect another consistent Slayton season with his usual share of explosive plays.</p><p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180514/jauan-jennings/\">Jauan Jennings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a>:</strong> Jennings was a major positive in what was mostly a negative season for the 49ers. He entered the season with 78 catches for 963 yards and seven touchdowns in three seasons. Then he had 77 receptions for 975 yards and six touchdowns in 2024 alone, in addition to his customary terrific blocking and toughness. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967489/brandon-aiyuk/\">Brandon Aiyuk</a> isn't expected to be ready for the start of training camp coming off a major injury, so Jennings should be in for a big workload early ... <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jauan-jennings-trade-rumors-raiders-steelers-among-logical-landing-spots-for-49ers-disgruntled-receiver/\" target=\"_blank\">if he isn't traded before the season</a></span>.</p><p><strong>11. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126241/demario-douglas/\">DeMario Douglas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a>:</strong> The Patriots signed <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000038/stefon-diggs/\">Stefon Diggs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2010349/mack-hollins/\">Mack Hollins</a> this offseason, but it's Douglas -- a 2023 sixth-round selection -- who might be the key for New England. The undersized slot man posted six receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695757/drake-mayes/\">Drake Maye's</a> first NFL start and averaged more than five catches and 50 yards in the six games he played at least two-thirds of New England's snaps. Josh McDaniels' offenses have long elevated slot receivers.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>12. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162586/marvin-mims/\">Marvin Mims</a> Jr., <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a>:</strong> Mims technically has been a Pro Bowler (and an All-Pro, at that) each of the past two seasons as a return specialist. But here, we're talking about him as a wide receiver. Sean Payton's affinity for bigger wideouts showed early last year, but the explosive Mims worked his way into the rotation. Over the last five games, he had 23 catches for 341 yards and five touchdowns, lining up all over the place.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/most-important-non-qb-for-every-nfl-team-these-players-will-go-a-long-way-in-determining-their-clubs-success/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Most important non-QB for every NFL team: These players will go a long way in determining their club's success</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jared Dubin                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Most important non-QB for every NFL team: These players will go a long way in determining their club's success\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/14/ac57e7b9-c67d-458e-9aec-59e0670cf257/thumbnail/270x152/f3b8b71294e342bd15af808e798ea700/travis-hunter.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Tight ends</h2><p><strong>13. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3133332/tucker-kraft/\">Tucker Kraft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a>:</strong> After playing just over half of Green Bay's offensive snaps in 2023, Kraft jumped to 87% in 2024 and produced a 50/707/7 receiving line. For as much as <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239997/jordan-love/\">Jordan Love</a> loves to push the ball downfield, he found a rugged, reliable outlet in Kraft, who led all tight ends in NFL Next Gen Stat's expected YAC difference -- how much YAC he produced compared to how much was expected given his speed, defenders' positioning, etc.</p><p><strong>14. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961270/pat-freiermuth/\">Pat Freiermuth</a>, Steelers:</strong>&nbsp;Coming off career-high 65 receptions, Freiermuth is a hulking 6-foot-5 and 257 pounds who can really get rolling in a straight line. Pittsburgh's receiving options behind <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260185/dk-metcalf/\">DK Metcalf</a> are limited, and Freiermuth could emerge as a trusted (he caught 83% of his targets last year, best of all tight ends) and high-volume option for Rodgers.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>15. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701481/terrance-ferguson/\">Terrance Ferguson</a>, Rams:</strong> Ferguson ran a 4.63-second 40-yard dash at the combine, fastest of all tight ends. That vaulted him up draft boards, and the Rams made him their top selection of the draft in the second round. The Rams really haven't had any sort of explosive element at tight end under Sean McVay, who will be plenty excited to put Ferguson in advantageous positions.</p><h2>Offensive linemen</h2><p><strong>16. Olu Fashanu (LT), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a>:</strong> Fashanu played a limited role last year after being drafted 11th overall. That changes this year, when he's expected to protect Justin Fields' blindside. Still just 22 years old, Fashanu had ups and downs as a rookie, but he generally trended in the right direction down the stretch, notching his two best pass-blocking Pro Football Focus' grades in Weeks 15 and 13.</p><p><strong>17. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867494/walker-little/\">Walker Little</a> (LT), Jaguars:</strong> Walker, who has played 17 games just once, has been an on-and-off starter in Jacksonville. Now, with heightened expectations given the hire of Coen and the addition of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/\">Travis Hunter</a>, the Jaguars are hoping Walker can become the answer at left tackle. Little graded out solidly, if unspectacularly last season, though the Jaguars as a whole ranked in the bottom dozen in both pass blocking and run blocking grades. The Buccaneers' offensive line was one of the game's best last year in Coen's offense.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>18. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252420/jaylon-moore/\">Jaylon Moore</a> (LT), Chiefs:</strong>&nbsp;Moore has never started more than five games in a season, but the Chiefs gave him a two-year, $30 million contract in their latest attempt to solve what has proved to be a tricky left tackle situation. Kansas City also drafted <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26734216/josh-simmons/\">Josh Simmons</a> in the first round, but he's coming off a major knee injury. Regardless, Moore is going to see a lot of action, and Kansas City is making a big bet on his athletic tools and the decent showing he had in a limited sample size.</p><p><strong>19. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123236/darnell-wright/\">Darnell Wright</a> (RT), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a>:</strong> Wright showed growth from his first year to his second year, and with a new offensive system under new head coach <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/395994/ben-johnson/\">Ben Johnson</a>, Chicago hopes he'll take yet another step. Johnson had a true weapon at right tackle in Detroit in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967844/penei-sewell/\">Penei Sewell</a>, and he'll hope Wright's upward trajectory continues, especially given the resources the Bears put into the interior of the offensive line.</p><p><strong>20. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163956/tate-ratledge/\">Tate Ratledge</a> (C/G) and 21. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3127033/christian-mahogany/\">Christian Mahogany</a> (G), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>:</strong> The Lions drafted Ratledge in the second round in part because of his ability to play both guard and center. Little did they know they'd rely on it this quickly. After stalwart center <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2141931/frank-ragnow/\">Frank Ragnow</a> retired at 29, Detroit has an opening at center, and Ratledge and veteran <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1868371/graham-glasgow/\">Graham Glasgow</a> are the primary candidates. If Ratledge doesn't end up at center, he will likely start at one guard spot, with Mahogany at the other. A sixth-round pick in 2024, Mahogany played limited snaps as a rookie but will step into a big role with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1631203/kevin-zeitlers/\">Kevin Zeitler's</a> departure.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>22. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125829/patrick-paul/\">Patrick Paul</a> (LT) and 23. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28877412/jonah-savaiinaea/\">Jonah Savaiinaea</a> (LG), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a>:</strong> Miami drafted Paul in the second round last year and doubled down on helping its front by trading up to draft Savaiinaea in the second round this year. They provide the necessary heft (Paul is 6-foot-7 and 332 pounds; Savaiinaea is 6-foot-4 and 324 pounds) for a team that desperately needs more physicality. If Paul can refine his raw athleticism and show last year's struggles were just typical rookie ups and downs and Savaiinaea can play well next to him, Miami may have the future of the left side of its line.</p><p><strong>24. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251296/will-fries/\">Will Fries</a> (RG), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a>:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1893142/ryan-kelly/\">Ryan Kelly</a> made the top 100 most important players, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26702924/donovan-jackson/\">Donovan Jackson</a> was a first-round pick, so that leaves Fries as the only member of Minnesota's completely remade interior offensive line eligible for this list. Fries played in just five games for the Colts last year before breaking his leg. Minnesota got abysmal guard play last year, so Fries recovering and providing an upgrade will be key, especially for new starting quarterback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695214/j-j-mccarthy/\">J.J. McCarthy</a></p><p><strong>25. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2826973/zion-johnson/\">Zion Johnson</a> (C/G), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a>:</strong> Johnson is expected to get a shot to be the team's starting center after playing guard his first three seasons. The Chargers hope that brings out more from the 2022 first-rounder, and if that proves true, it will dramatically help the interior of the line, which struggled between bookend tackles <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2835704/rashawn-slater/\">Rashawn Slater</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26713136/joe-alt/\">Joe Alt</a>.</p><p><strong>26. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2807108/andrew-vorhees/\">Andrew Vorhees</a> (LG), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a>:</strong> The Ravens return every significant offensive piece ... except for at left guard, where <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180273/patrick-mekari/\">Patrick Mekari</a> left for Jacksonville. Vorhees was expected to be a mid/early-round pick in 2023 before an injury at the NFL Scouting Combine caused him to slide to the seventh round and miss the entire season. He produced mixed results in limited action last year.</p><p><strong>27. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2962427/olusegun-oluwatimi/\" target=\"_blank\">Olu Oluwatimi</a> (C) and 28. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963524/christian-haynes/\">Christian Haynes</a> (RG), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a>:</strong>. Seattle had one of the worst offensive lines in the NFL last year and is counting on Oluwatimi and Haynes to take big steps in their third and second years, respectively. Oluwatimi started seeing action later in the year and had some moments, while Haynes really didn't play much. That they're protecting Darnold -- who needs good protection -- makes them even more crucial.</p><p><strong>29. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3164613/peter-skoronski/\">Peter Skoronski</a> (LG), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a>:</strong> A 2023 first-round pick, Skoronski has been up and down through two NFL seasons. He graded out highly as a pass protector last season but struggled in the run game. Tennessee has spent significant resources on the offensive line over the past two offseasons, and Skoronski living up to his draft status would be an immense help.</p><p><strong>30. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240820/ryan-neuzil/\">Ryan Neuzil</a> (C), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a>:</strong> With <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865272/drew-dalman/\">Drew Dalman</a> off to Chicago, Neuzil steps in as <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963496/michael-penix-jr-s/\">Michael Penix Jr.'s</a> first full-time center (Penix started just three games last year). Atlanta had a historically good running game, and the center-quarterback connection is especially important for young quarterbacks, putting a lot of weight on Neuzil's shoulders.</p><p><strong>31. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865698/trevor-penning/\">Trevor Penning</a> (LG), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a>:</strong>&nbsp;With a season win total set at an NFL-worst 4.5, the Saints might be in for a long season, one in which the progress of their youngsters will likely outweigh the scoreboard. Penning is one such youngster. The Saints moved way up in the 2022 draft -- only to see him struggle at left tackle. They drafted <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28910065/kelvin-banks-jr/\">Kelvin Banks Jr</a>. this year and are moving Penning inside. If he succeeds there, New Orleans could have some semblances of a promising offensive line.</p><h2>Defensive linemen/EDGE</h2><p><strong>32. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260648/rashan-gary/\">Rashan Gary</a> (EDGE), Packers:</strong> Gary is the one exception to the rules I laid out above. He was a Pro Bowl selection even though he had 7.5 sacks (tied for 36th in the NFL) and an 11.7% pressure rate (45th, minimum 300 pass rush snaps). He was the 25th-best EDGE in football last season, per Pro Football Focus. He has had significantly better seasons in which he wasn't selected. Regardless, Green Bay would love to see him return to his 2021-23 form and make an inconsistent pass rush much more reliable.</p><p><strong>33. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804418/baron-browning/\">Baron Browning</a> (EDGE), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a>:</strong> Arizona made upgrades all over the defensive line this offseason via big signings (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179277/josh-sweat/\">Josh Sweat</a>), early draft picks (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28923687/walter-nolen/\">Walter Nolen</a> in the first round) and veteran additions (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/520548/calais-campbell/\">Calais Campbell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000919/dalvin-tomlinson/\">Dalvin Tomlinson</a>). But it's Browning, acquired from Denver at the 2024 trade deadline, who gets the nod here. From Week 10 onward in Arizona, he had an impressive 15.5% pressure rate, better than big names such as <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2818165/trey-hendrickson/\">Trey Hendrickson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2165317/chris-jones/\">Chris Jones</a> and even his new teammate Sweat.</p><p><strong>34. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961519/moro-ojomo/\">Moro Ojomo</a> (DE) and 35. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125143/jalyx-hunt/\">Jalyx Hunt</a> (EDGE), Eagles:</strong> The Eagles have a conveyor belt of disruptive defensive linemen, and they're hoping Ojomo and Hunt are the next products. Ojomo did not have a single sack last year, but his 12.2% pressure rate was actually better than teammates <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123027/nolan-smith/\">Nolan Smith</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163950/jalen-carter/\">Jalen Carter</a>. Hunt had an even smaller role but showed some real burst off the edge.</p><p><strong>36. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061110/leonard-floyd/\">Leonard Floyd</a> (EDGE), Falcons:</strong> The Falcons spent two first-round picks on edge rushers, but it would hardly be a surprise if Floyd out-produced either or both. He's had at least 8.5 sacks each of the last four seasons, and while that may not sound like much, the Falcons haven't had a player with more than 6.5 in a season over that span.</p><p><strong>37. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967409/bobby-brown-iii/\">Bobby Brown III</a> (DT), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Last season, the Panthers allowed the most rushing yards by any team since the 1980 Saints, so they brought in Brown, a hulking defensive tackle (6-foot-4 and 332 pounds), to plug the gaps alongside star <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2241797/derrick-brown/\">Derrick Brown</a>. The interior of the Carolina defensive line can't get much worse, but the Brown duo can be a big part of it getting a lot better.</p><p><strong>38. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168167/alfred-collins/\">Alfred Collins</a> (DT), 49ers:</strong> Collins is one of four -- yes, four -- front-seven defenders the 49ers took within the first four rounds of the draft. Like Brown, Collins is a massive man (6-foot-5 and 332 pounds) who has one primary goal: stop the run. San Francisco was 25th in defensive rushing success rate last year, one of many reasons behind their fall off.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/top-25-worst-nfl-coaching-hires-this-century-from-bobby-petrino-to-nick-saban-to-urban-meyer-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Top 25 worst NFL coaching hires this century: From Bobby Petrino to Nick Saban to Urban Meyer and more</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cody Benjamin                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Top 25 worst NFL coaching hires this century: From Bobby Petrino to Nick Saban to Urban Meyer and more\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2022/05/04/9e95ddd6-d7db-465e-947e-8d3db2544d2f/thumbnail/270x152/33d7b9074a4b6cc6c0475a5070294933/urban-meyer-getty.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Linebackers</h2><p><strong>39. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3136909/marist-liufau/\">Marist Liufau</a>, Cowboys:</strong> Thrown into the mix as a rookie after <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964705/demarvion-overshowns/\">DeMarvion Overshown's</a> devastating injury, Liufau had ups and downs as the Cowboys played out the string. Now, with Dallas expecting to return to the playoffs, Liufau steps in as a key cog in the middle. He has lots to improve, but he plays like his hair is on fire and can bring it on blitzes, too.</p><p><strong>40. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121026/christian-harris/\">Christian Harris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a>:</strong> Harris' career has been a bit of a roller coaster so far, with the Alabama product ascending from quiet rookie to sophomore standout and then playing in just three games in his third season due to calf and ankle injuries. Harris is a talent who the Texans hope they can line up behind a fearsome pass rush, but injuries are an issue.</p><p><strong>41. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26724333/carson-schwesinger/\">Carson Schwesinger</a>, Browns:</strong> Schwesinger rose from former walk-on to senior starter to draft riser to second-round pick, and the Browns hope that trajectory has no end in sight. A heady linebacker with quickness and a knack for finding the ball-carrier, Schwesinger could step right into the starting middle linebacker role. And while there will be an adjustment period, Cleveland hopes it found the next key piece of what is still a talented defense.</p><p><strong>42. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866310/daiyan-henley/\">Daiyan Henley</a>, Chargers:</strong> Henley made a massive leap between his rookie year -- when he was hardly used -- to his 147-tackle second season. A smooth athlete who covers very well for the position, Henley is a major ascending talent in the middle of the Chargers defense, and I wouldn't be surprised if a breakout 2025 is in store.</p><h2>Defensive backs</h2><p><strong>43. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3133282/daxton-hill/\">Daxton Hill</a> (CB) and 44. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3133344/dj-turner/\">DJ Turner</a> II (CB), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a>:</strong> Hill and Turner both suffered season-ending injuries, but both former Michigan standouts showed strong improvement year-over-year. Hill, a 2022 first-rounder, and Turner, a 2023 second-rounder, saw their PFF grades jump significantly. Hill, who had the larger sample size, allowed just 5.6 yards per attempt as the primary defender after allowing 9.4 as a rookie. Both will be big parts of new defensive coordinator Al Golden's scheme.</p><p><strong>45. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693635/cole-bishop/\">Cole Bishop</a> (S), Bills:</strong> The Bills are desperate for better safety play after last year's starters -- <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2250213/damar-hamlin/\">Damar Hamlin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240202/taylor-rapp/\">Taylor Rapp</a> -- graded out as PFF's 42nd- and 45th-best safeties out of the 55 who played at least 700 snaps. That's where Buffalo hopes Bishop steps in. The 2024 second-round pick picked up a shoulder injury in training camp last year, stunting his development. With a full offseason, Bishop should be in line to take over as a starter.</p><p><strong>46. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179803/jamel-dean/\">Jamel Dean</a> (CB), Buccaneers:</strong> Dean missed time last season with injuries to both knees and a hamstring, and Tampa Bay missed him when he was sidelined. With Dean on the field, the Buccaneers allowed 6.8 yards per attempt and an 89.6 passer rating, Without him, those numbers were 7.6 and 111.4, respectively. Dean graded out as PFF's 14th-best cornerback out of 77 who played at least 600 snaps.</p><p><strong>47. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2247190/jeremy-chinn/\">Jeremy Chinn</a> (S), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Given a one-year \"prove-it\" deal with the Commanders last year, Chinn proved it. His 107 tackles were 10th among defensive backs. Add in a pair of sacks and seven tackles for loss as a whole, and he earned a nice two-year deal for Las Vegas, which hopes his physicality carries over.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>48. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3164271/trey-amos/\">Trey Amos</a> (CB), Commanders:</strong> Washington found a gem in last year's second-round cornerback, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121278/mike-sainristil/\">Mike Sainristil</a>, and hopes this year's version, Amos, is able to make a similar immediate impact. At 6-foot-1 he has the size to play outside, which would allow Washington to slide Sainristil inside, and he tested well at the combine. Rookie cornerbacks can experience a trial by fire, but if Amos holds up, it's a huge improvement for a defense that needs to improve.</p><p><strong>49. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966542/mekhi-blackmon/\">Mekhi Blackmon</a> (CB), Vikings:</strong> There were a several ways to go here regarding the Vikings' cornerback room, but Blackmon ultimately earned the nod. After flashing as a seldom-used rookie -- eight pass breakups and an interception -- Blackmon tore his ACL and missed all of 2024. But he's in the mix or potentially a favorite for a starting job this year.</p><p><strong>50. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122290/deonte-banks/\">Deonte Banks</a> (CB), Giants:</strong> A 2023 first-round pick, Banks followed up a strong debut with a disappointing second year. The numbers bear it out: He allowed a 90.6 passer rating and 8.6 yards per attempt as the primary defender in 2024 after 67.5 and 6.9, respectively, in 2023. The Giants have a fearsome pass rush and newcomers <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967873/jevon-holland/\">Jevon Holland</a> at safety and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867304/paulson-adebo/\">Paulson Adebo</a> at cornerback, but Banks improving might be the key to tie it all together.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

He also acknowledged that making such a bold move for Belichick was a \"<a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/sports/2025/07/robert-kraft-describes-the-best-move-he-ever-made-as-patriots-owner.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">big risk</a>,\" given that Belichick previously had a losing record as the coach of the Cleveland Browns.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Belichick, however, it was he that took the \"big risk\" in accepting the job. The Patriots had stagnated under former coach Pete Carroll and frivolous spending put them beyond the salary cap, limiting what Belichick could do in terms of roster management.&nbsp;</p><p>\"As I told Robert multiple times through the years, I took a big risk by taking the New England Patriots head coaching job,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45748727/bill-belichick-says-took-big-risk-taking-patriots-job\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Belichick told ESPN</a>. \"I already had an opportunity to be the Head Coach of the New York Jets, but the ownership situation was unstable.\" &nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of who actually took the \"big risk,\" the move worked out well for both sides. After posting a 5-11 record in 2000 -- his first year with the franchise -- Belichick guided New England to victory in Super Bowl XXXVI. That was the first of six Super Bowls for the Patriots under Belichick, kick-starting arguably the greatest football dynasty the NFL has ever seen. He didn't have a single losing record from 2001-2020, and New England made the postseason every year from 2009-2019.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Belichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways in January 2024.

Alexander-Arnold prepared to take a corner kick and saw Barcelona were lackadaisical in setting up defensively, so he took advantage with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVK5HoZc-mI\" target=\"_blank\">a perfect whipped pass</a> to the feet of <a data-player-guid=\"3d886d42-f85b-d531-70f5-359a60cf92ac\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/182033/divock-origi\">Divock Origi</a> that decided the tie. Liverpool completed another one of their great Champions League escapes and advanced to the final, where they defeated <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f987a4b2-f3f9-e7f6-eb7d-eda43893be5a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=367\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> to win their sixth European crown.</p><p>In the years that followed, the success continued.

Alexander-Arnold was a large reason for that success, <a href=\"https://stathead.com/tiny/ySn6D\" target=\"_blank\">ranking third</a> in assists in the Premier League from 2018 through this past season. His ability to create in open play and from dead-ball situations as a full-back is game-breaking.</p><p>A talent of Alexander-Arnold's caliber doesn't come around often, and Liverpool were the beneficiaries at the senior level for nearly a decade. That's no longer the case, as he left Merseyside when his contract expired for a new challenge with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/fifa.cwc\">Club World Cup</a>, in which the Spanish giants were soundly defeated by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/160/paris-saint-germain\">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in the semifinals, marked the beginning of a new chapter of the English star's career and we got an early glimpse of what he might bring to <a data-league-guid=\"cf7b0c51-7c48-3e9a-8abb-0c01b1a973a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ESP.1\">LaLiga</a>.</p><p>But before we project what might come next season and beyond, it's important to first look back at Alexander-Arnold's journey in getting to this point.</p><hr><h2>The early days under Klopp</h2><p>The version of Liverpool which Jürgen Klopp took over and tried to mold early in his managerial tenure was far different to the iteration that later brought sustained success.

Klopp himself in the past <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvHT3BJu7g4\" target=\"_blank\">described counterpressing</a> as the best playmaker. Players such as <a data-player-guid=\"ea9705e7-d462-d183-e266-7fc6880a1534\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/93736/joe-allen\">Joe Allen</a> <a href=\"https://spielverlagerung.com/2016/07/15/tactical-analysis-jurgen-klopps-liverpool/\" target=\"_blank\">were vital</a> in those first few months while the club was establishing its tactical identity; Allen had the stamina and tactical awareness to win the ball often and help create fast attacks.</p><p>It made for some impressive and captivating victories in the Premier League: doing the double vs. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a> in 2015-16, the 5-4 thriller away at Norwich, a double against <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"feb44e87-58fa-9597-2691-b3c32768ebe4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=359\">Arsenal</a> in 2016-17, and a few blowout victories in Klopp's first 18 months. That focus on creating transitional moments through an aggressive out-of-possession approach also helped fuel Liverpool's run to the 2016 <a data-league-guid=\"ffe3e604-9c8d-38dc-ab82-c033a9112867\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/UEFA.EUROPA\">Europa League</a> final, which included another memorable Anfield comeback vs. Dortmund.</p><p>The downside was that when Liverpool played teams more willing to hunker down and force the Reds to play against a set defense, results were more mixed. For all the highs that Liverpool experienced, there were also many instances of not being able to break down stubborn low blocks in the league against clubs who didn't allow space into which Klopp's stars could attack. This led to many lost points over the course of a season, and a hard ceiling on their level of domestic success.</p><p>For Liverpool to graduate from a plucky but flawed side to a great team, both the personnel and the tactics had to evolve.</p><hr><h2>Alexander-Arnold's influence</h2><p>The rest of the 2010s saw Liverpool's attack rounded into form, largely thanks to smart recruitment and a bit of good fortune. The club acquired top-notch forward talent for relatively low transfer fees in <a data-player-guid=\"0a18a773-8594-8e1d-a614-a8274022110b\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/147234/roberto-firmino\">Roberto Firmino</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"36cf625e-f647-9120-d104-00d8a7a92f65\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/169797/sadio-mane\">Sadio Mané</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"49438d5e-de32-9f1b-9aab-5f6ae53f14d0\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/173896/mohamed-salah\">Mohamed Salah</a>. Signing <a data-player-guid=\"2ac3f3cf-816a-d765-a27a-4039ab6d6f13\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/104943/andrew-robertson\">Andrew Robertson</a> from Hull City in summer 2017 paid immediate dividends as he regularly started in both the league and the Champions League. Alexander-Arnold emerged from the club's academy as a teenager to also play consistent minutes, something you don't often see. Combine all of that, and you get the backbone of what ended up being one of the most captivating attacks in Europe.</p><p>In addition to the acquisitions, Liverpool altered their gameplan. To get the best out of Mané and Salah, Robertson and Alexander-Arnold became prominent parts of Liverpool's attack, pushing up and acting as wingers in a front five during settled possession in the opposition half. The midfield -- which included the likes of <a data-player-guid=\"1e734549-90ed-67fb-c947-344b9c52c9d1\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/176287/fabinho\">Fabinho</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"435e1a5a-d343-375b-817d-d67027e08385\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/127262/jordan-henderson\">Jordan Henderson</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"778dec0b-3a10-80b5-229a-7113d6e1f295\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/98342/georginio-wijnaldum\">Georginio Wijnaldum</a> -- would cover the spaces left behind, alongside a generational defender in <a data-player-guid=\"c350cf83-87c2-aedd-b25b-7e9f3f3fa4dd\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/157892/virgil-van-dijk\">Virgil van Dijk</a>. That version of Liverpool held up from 2018-20, before the addition of <a data-player-guid=\"d7f3bd44-c422-dd90-3b9e-3ac03ebcd6b3\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/135293/thiago-alcantara\">Thiago Alcantara</a> led to the midfield playing a greater role in the team's attack from 2021-23.</p><p>An easy way of seeing the full-backs' influence is to look at how cross-heavy Liverpool were during this period. Going back to the 2017-18 Premier League season; Stathead has the 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23 iterations of Liverpool in the top 10 for most crosses in a single season. This reconfiguration makes sense when accounting for just how much of an outlier Alexander-Arnold has been as a creator. According to FBref, he has been in the 90th percentile or higher in the league for a slew of passing and creation metrics on a per-90 basis, including expected assists, shot-creating actions and progressive passes from 2019 to 2025. In that span, Alexander-Arnold ranks fourth in the PL for total attacking sequence involvements ending in a shot, and 14th per 90 minutes for players with at least 10,000 minutes.</p><p>Few players in the history of the league have been as devastating a crosser as Alexander-Arnold. One name that comes to mind is David Beckham during his time with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6ebc2fd0-35d3-733b-5666-b75035a3bce9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=360\">Manchester United</a>, an era when you were often aiming for one of two strikers in the box. A contemporary of Alexander-Arnold's, <a data-player-guid=\"c2bc0ee8-46fa-2189-ca21-014bc1c0e7e2\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/134947/kevin-de-bruyne\">Kevin De Bruyne</a> (who <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45331440/kevin-de-bruyne-joins-napoli-free-transfer-man-city-exit\">also departed the Premier League</a> for <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"20179aab-ac9f-93cf-f139-404e49a3f3cb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=114\">Napoli</a>) made <a href=\"https://www.thetransferflow.com/p/no-other-playmaker-has-ever-had-kevin-de-bruyne-s-skillset-c1c8\" target=\"_blank\">the right half-space</a> his office for many key passes and assists via crosses.</p><p>De Bruyne was a bigger threat to make runs into the wide zones of the box for square passes or cutbacks toward the middle, while Alexander-Arnold was a marvelous aerial passer from deeper areas. Both could hit off-ball runners at the far post with whipped deliveries that consistently hit the target, including in moments after a teammate wins the ball high and they get time on the ball to survey their options.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0714/r1519091_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>Alexander-Arnold was more than just a cross-spamming defender. He had great touch on diagonal switches of play that could discombobulate the opposition. Despite being a full-back, he was a threat to generate those high-value through balls you'd associate with a technical midfielder. The off-the-ball movement was a lesser part of his game compared with others at his position, but he was no slouch there, either. In particular, he could make himself available for short switches near the box that helped amplify his passing.</p><p>Progressive carries under duress and one-on-one dribbling were not major hallmarks of his game, but the passing was so overwhelming that it ultimately didn't matter. The heat map below from 2019 to 2022 shows the greatest concentration just inside the opposition half, where Alexander-Arnold would regularly attempt crosses or look to switch the play.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0714/r1519093_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>This period was a perfect marriage between Alexander-Arnold's unique skill set and Liverpool's attack being more unpredictable than most top sides' at the time. They were comfortable playing a more vertical game, because in addition to Mané and Salah being the rare attackers who were both technically and physically dominant, Alexander-Arnold was more than willing to service them with a variety of passes from different angles.</p><hr><h2>The inverted full-back experiment</h2><p>Toward the end of the 2022-23 season, an interesting pattern emerged. Liverpool were experiencing a decline in form compared to previous campaigns, ultimately missing out on Champions League qualification -- something that hadn't happened since Klopp was hired in October 2015. Opponents were better prepared to game-plan against Liverpool's base attack, and combined with the midfield core ageing out of their respective primes, they were more susceptible to <a href=\"https://theanalyst.com/articles/what-went-wrong-for-liverpool-in-2022-23\" target=\"_blank\">transition attacks</a>. While Liverpool had always given up high-quality chances on average in the past (an inevitability for proactive defensive sides), creating high turnovers helped keep the volume down and the math on their side. That wasn't the case in 2022-23.</p><p>As such, Klopp made the interesting decision to move Alexander-Arnold more centrally as part of a double pivot. The idea of full-backs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk05PKO6v2M\">moving inward</a> as a midfielder in possession had become en vogue as a method of asserting control. Why? Because by overloading the middle, you're more likely to progress between the lines. If the opposition tries to combat that with a more narrow out-of-possession structure, there's easier access to the flanks. While Alexander-Arnold previously had license to roam inward when needed, he tended to operate like a typical marauding full-back during the 2010s. With Liverpool no longer controlling matches like they had in previous seasons, changing his role was worth a try.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0714/r1519095_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>The results were instant. From the March international break until the end of the season, Liverpool were tied for third in points per match. Their <a href=\"https://understat.com/league/EPL/2022\" target=\"_blank\">underlying numbers</a> were what you'd expect from a top-four side, an upgrade over their performance for most of the season before the change, but still below the previous season.</p><p>The 2023-24 campaign was even more promising, with Liverpool being in the heart of the title race for long stretches. If not for Salah's injury and downturn of form after the 2024 <a data-league-guid=\"bb156ba1-46ad-7892-2b1c-afb73035e08f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/CAF.NATIONS\">Africa Cup of Nations</a>, it's possible their 20th league title would've come a year earlier than it did.</p><p>What made Alexander-Arnold's interpretation of the inverted full-back role interesting was that while he became more meticulous with the tempo of his passing, he still often showed the directness we came to associate with him. By contrast, someone like <a data-player-guid=\"e2ea8b55-6695-7646-35db-c41fd3bfdb38\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/217482/oleksandr-zinchenko\">Oleksandr Zinchenko</a> would <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrjr0ekugjI&amp;t=404s\" target=\"_blank\">look to circulate possession</a>, show fluid positioning off the ball, and act as a decoy. Alexander-Arnold would constantly look to spray passes forward <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnI0Hm6a_jk&amp;t=369s\" target=\"_blank\">like a deep-lying playmaker</a>, whether between the lines or over the top of the opposition defensive line. More than anything, his presence through the middle was to help create more transitional moments, which fitted the club's M.O. In the 2023-24 season, Alexander-Arnold was sixth in the Premier League for total through balls completed, <a href=\"https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/2023-2024/passing_types/2023-2024-Premier-League-Stats\" target=\"_blank\">according to FBref</a>, with no other defender coming close in the rankings.</p><p>It's fair to say Alexander-Arnold performed admirably during this stretch and remained a dynamic playmaker, but the new usage wasn't without its faults. In particular, he wasn't the most graceful under pressure, and his back-to-goal play was a mixed bag, making him more vulnerable to pressing than midfielders or even select inverted full-backs. This led to Klopp trying to get him in more situations facing forward outside the opposition block when receiving centrally as the 2023-24 season progressed.</p><hr><h2>Swansong under Slot</h2><p>The 2024-25 season saw Alexander-Arnold return more to the role he had in earlier years. A greater proportion of his open play touches were from the right flank, and he wasn't trying to moonlight as a pivot operator quite so often. While he still did have more license to roam centrally compared to his earlier years, it was more measured and selective.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0714/r1519097_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>Liverpool under manager Arne Slot last season were a bit different compared with Klopp's team. The Dutch coach prioritized a greater emphasis on control through building up centrally, including the times when Liverpool would attempt to bait the press in the hopes of creating artificial transitions. In settled possession, they would often have four behind the ball during buildup with either a single midfielder or double pivot in place. The midfield trio of Ryan Gravenberch, <a data-player-guid=\"7e22516b-6c44-1ecd-b8a0-c34530c8e242\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/249299/alexis-mac-allister\">Alexis Mac Allister</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"fab1b006-532b-8133-de47-647e95a46877\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257206/dominik-szoboszlai\">Dominik Szoboszlai</a> was a massive change from what Liverpool had in previous years, and it was the bedrock for playing through the opposition. In early phases of possession, Alexander-Arnold himself would often be the most advanced of the back four, which would resemble an L-shape.</p><p>This had a knock-on effect in which Alexander-Arnold's attacking gifts were used less often and he wasn't quite the creative hub he had been in prior seasons. His <a href=\"https://fbref.com/tiny/BXTr8\" target=\"_blank\">stats</a> showed a noticeable reduction, as others in the squad took up more responsibilities. There was a greater level of caution in his approach, in line with the overall tactics.</p><p>There were still moments where Alexander-Arnold's passing helped swing matches. He had a late secondary assist to help Liverpool draw at Arsenal in October via a perfectly weighted lob in behind to <a data-player-guid=\"c56f203e-3b2f-5384-116c-c5fb3781e120\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/271788/darwin-nunez\">Darwin Núñez</a>. In Liverpool's 6-3 victory over <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f987a4b2-f3f9-e7f6-eb7d-eda43893be5a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=367\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> during the Christmas period, he delivered an inch-perfect cross to <a data-player-guid=\"9959537e-af42-929e-a829-cc149924d7f4\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257390/luis-diaz\">Luis Díaz</a> for the opening goal. In the 90th minute away versus <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0446e7fd-7655-f17a-d282-8c401b808d1f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=337\">Brentford</a> in January, Alexander-Arnold's underlapping run into the wide right zone of the box and eventual low cross was met by Núñez to break the deadlock in what ended up being a 2-0 win.</p><p>If Slot-ball made Alexander-Arnold a slightly more peripheral figure in attack, it helped mitigate his defensive shortcomings. Alexander-Arnold was never a net positive on defense for a variety of reasons, including athletic deficiencies defending in one-vs.-ones and a lack of off-the-ball awareness. The combination of having more players behind the ball during buildup, and Liverpool primarily defending in a 4-2-4 shape out of possession to limit central progression, helped mitigate some of the concerns.</p><hr><h2>Taking on a new challenge in Spain</h2><p>Once it became clear Alexander-Arnold would sign with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"66434654-a8ba-a04c-98e5-6bbd0dbbb780\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a>, there was considerable intrigue about how he'd fit into their starting XI. This was especially true once Xabi Alonso became the club's manager.</p><p>What we did know from Alonso's time with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"483ec574-cb09-6d8f-e308-302d5d695d70\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=131\">Bayer Leverkusen</a> was his insistence on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYBTQclvjNs\" target=\"_blank\">controlling matches</a>, not from a dogmatic adherence to formation or structure, but instead having clear principles both in and out of possession. From there, it's adapting to the skill sets available to him within the squad so they can problem-solve on the fly over the course of 90 minutes.</p><p>Some thought there could be initial synergy found with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/252107/vinicius-junior\">Vinícius Júnior</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231388/kylian-mbappe\">Kylian Mbappé</a>. Those two are some of the best in the world at puncturing high defensive lines through straight-line movements in behind the opposition. They could take advantage of long aerials directed their way, especially in moments of controlled chaos from high turnovers or second-ball regains. Whenever Alexander-Arnold takes up aggressive positions against a low block, <a data-player-guid=\"4596832d-d906-4ce5-b3b4-eee94499abad\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/235818/federico-valverde\">Federico Valverde</a> can help cover for him defensively due to his impressive ground coverage.</p><p>The Club World Cup gave us a very early look into Alexander-Arnold's potential role with Real Madrid. There were some clunky moments during the early stages of buildup, including Alexander-Arnold not cleanly receiving with his back to goal and allowing incoming pressure. He also occasionally missed straightforward short-range passes toward the double pivot in space to help progress play.</p><p>Once Real Madrid made it to the opposition half, Alexander-Arnold was much more of a peripheral figure compared to previous years -- especially under Klopp. He largely stuck to providing width along the right flank, with occasional underlapping runs in the right channel. The lack of runners into the box made it tougher for him to connect on his famous crosses.</p><p>In general, the slow tempo in attack and the lack of opportunities to play in chaos moments also took away some of what made Alexander-Arnold special in the Premier League. Without being such a cheat code in possession, it amplified some of the defensive worries. His high positioning prevented him from helping effectively in the counterpress, and some indecision in situations when they're trying to trap the opposition near their own box.</p><p>This isn't to say that there weren't bright moments during the Club World Cup. Alexander-Arnold's crossing was accurate and sharp in Madrid's group stage victory vs. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"dde04f24-2c69-420c-96af-9cde73ef3f6f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2790\">RB Salzburg</a>. He had the assist for Madrid's goal in their 1-0 round-of-16 victory over <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"87fe4844-a7cf-c88e-2ebe-aeb57325e990\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=111\">Juventus</a>, which came from an improvised underlapping run into the box that set up a short-range driven cross.</p><p>It should be noted that we're talking about a handful of matches during what was essentially a preseason tournament, so taking a ton from it would be unwise. However, it would be fair to suggest that there could be some growing pains in Year 1.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45712452\" data-cerebro-id=\"687046edac2b6424ea62d3bb\" data-title=\"Bale: Mbappé critcism due to Real Madrid's lack of trophies\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45712452\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:34</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Bale: Mbappé critcism due to Real Madrid's lack of trophies</p><p>Gareth Bale backs Xabi Alonso to get the best out of Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid's other attacking talents.</p></div></div><hr><h2>A lasting legacy, and what he'll do in Madrid</h2><p>For the past handful of seasons, warts and all, Alexander-Arnold has been one of the best players in the world. It's very rare that a full-back can be the leading or co-leading playmaker for one of the most dynamic attacks in the world over a multi-year stretch, which was the case with Liverpool. Having such an outsized impact in the final third more than made up for the drawbacks he had defensively, which included athletic limitations in one-vs.-one situations and being guilty of ball-watching. This helps explain why all-in-one metrics, such as Donald Cayton's <a href=\"http://www.gamemodelsfootball.com/ratings/mbappe-ratings/Trent-%25Alexander-Arnold-1998\" target=\"_blank\">MBAPPE model</a>, consistently rated him highly over the years. That level of impact is what Real Madrid will hope to see from Alexander-Arnold as the club seeks to bounce back from a very disappointing campaign in which they finished second in LaLiga and were bounced from the Champions League in the quarterfinals.</p><p>In theory, adding a player of his caliber as a free agent should be additive. However, we've seen over the years (such as with Real Madrid) that simply stacking talented players on top of each other doesn't necessarily make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p>Part of getting the best out of Alexander-Arnold will mean creating more of the controlled chaotic situations he thrived in with Liverpool. It could be very difficult given LaLiga's slower pace of play. Those dynamic situations would not only benefit him, but also others such as Mbappé and Vinícius. Trying to find a balance between embracing chaos and controlled possession, while also attempting to create a functional defensive unit, will define Alonso's tenure as Real Madrid's manager.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see what happens with Alexander-Arnold once he begins life in Spain. He could benefit from LaLiga being a less physically demanding league than the Premier League, but he'll also face a ton of low defensive blocks and potentially less situations against unsettled oppositions. Replicating what he accomplished in England will be a tall task, as he won all the major trophies possible with Liverpool. All the while, he accomplished that through an atypical style of play that transformed him into the team's quarterback in attack, a rare feat given the position he plays.</p><p>Trent Alexander-Arnold left the Premier League as one of its best players ever. Whether he can reach similar heights in LaLiga as a Real Madrid player will be fascinating to watch.</p>\n</div></div>"

That late surge, combined with the emergence of former five-star quarterback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a>, has confidence building in Gainesville heading into 2025. Gators insider Graham Hall of <a href=\"https://247sports.com/college/florida/\" target=\"_blank\">Swamp247</a> joined Bud Elliott on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/cover-3-college-football/id1257913963\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cover 3 College Football Summer School</a>&nbsp;series to preview expectations for the Gators this fall.</p><h2>What are the stakes for Florida in 2025?</h2><p>Win or expect a change at coach. That's the reality for Florida and Billy Napier, who is an even 19-19 in the previous three seasons. That's not good enough and everyone in Gainesville knows it. Do the Gators need to contend for an SEC championship? Probably not. But they shouldn't be fighting for bowl eligibility in November like they've been recently.</p><p>\"This is a team that has consistently touted that they're deeper than they've ever been,\" Hall said. \"He's got the entirety of his roster in there. There's no more excuse of, 'Hey, I'm coaching guys from the previous regime.' He has all his coaches in place. They've spent a ton of resources on overhauling the strength program. There's no excuses for Florida.\"</p><p>A big piece of that puzzle is Lagway, the No. 1 quarterback from the 2024 recruiting class who showed flashes last season and now takes over as Florida's full-time starter. If Florida is going to take a step forward, it'll likely hinge on how quickly Lagway can grow into the role.</p>\n        \n\n\n<h2>Breakout player everybody needs to know</h2><p>Florida returns seven defensive starters from last season, but there's still a pressing need to solidify the interior of the defensive front. Redshirt junior <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28900966/jamari-lyons/\">Jamari Lyons</a>, who missed all of 2024 with a broken ankle suffered in fall camp, is working his way back. But keep an eye on 6-foot-5, 355-pound sophomore <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29389068/michai-boireau/\">Michai Boireau</a>, who could play a key role after transforming his body and gaining valuable experience last year.</p><p>\"The nose tackle position is one I'm really interested to see how that works out,\" Hall said. \"You have Michai Boireau coming back for his second season. ... Is he going to be a guy that you're going to slot into that interior defensive line to be a starter for you? I think that's a question Florida has to answer when they get to fall camp.\"</p><h2>Win total outlook</h2><p>Aside from location, the opponents on Florida's 2025 schedule are almost identical to last season, which was brutally difficult. But several of those teams appear to have taken a step back, potentially making the path more manageable.

Irishman Rory McIlroy won the Masters in April, becoming the sixth golfer to complete the career Grand Slam. McIlroy will look to win The Open for the second time in his career when he tees off at the Open Championship 2025. McIlroy is the second-favorite at +700, according to the latest 2025 Open Championship odds at FanDuel Sportsbook.&nbsp;</p><p>World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is going off as the +450 favorite on the PGA odds board. Other notable 2025 Open Championship contenders include Jon Rahm (+1200), Bryson DeChambeau (+2000) with reigning British Open champion Xander Schauffele (+2500) and Ludvig Aberg (+2800) also in the mix. Before locking in your 2025 Open Championship picks, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship\" target=\"_blank\">see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.</p><p>This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- and the 2025 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">sports betting</a> picks could have seen massive returns on <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a></span>.

McIlroy last won The Open in 2014, but missed the cut last year. In total, he has just a pair of top-10 finishes at this event since his 2014 win.</p><p>Though he did tie for second at the Scottish Open, McIlroy's full body of work hasn't been too impressive since the Masters win this year. He finished T47 at the PGA Championship and T19 at the U.S. Open. He also has just the one top-five finish at the Scottish Open in non-majors since his Masters victory. He's not a strong pick to win it all, and there are far better values in the 2025 Open Championship field.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to fade here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Another surprise: Tommy Fleetwood, a 26-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. While none of Fleetwood's 10 professional wins have come on the PGA Tour, he's been one of the most consistent golfers around. He's ranked inside the top 20 in World Ranking continuously since Aug. 2023 and is currently in the top 10 of FedEx Cup standings. He's been on, arguably, the best run of his career over the last few months with four top-7 finishes over his last seven tournaments, with three of those top 7s coming at signature events.</p><p>Fleetwood's performance on tour is validated by his metrics as he ranks third in both strokes gained: total and scoring average (adjusted). His major history at The Open is also impressive with four top-12 finishes over his last five British Open starts. That includes a runner-up the last time the major was at Royal Portrush (2019), so there are lots of things in Fleetwood's favor for The Open 2025. He has a much better chance to prevail than his long PGA odds imply, so Fleetwood would be a steal in Open Championship bets.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to pick here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>The model's outright best bets include four golfers going off at +2500 or higher, including two mammoth triple-digit longshots.

There was no opening night with the defending champs on Thursday or an international game on Friday (or any other game outside of the United States all season). No games were watched in high definition. The yellow, on-screen first-down line was roughly two years old. <a data-player-guid=\"37d87523-280a-9d4a-0adb-22cfc6d3619c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/2650/pat-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> was a pitcher on the Mets; <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">his son</a> was about to turn 5. <a data-player-guid=\"be3c0e30-5a1e-8174-091d-a41bf4e2d51e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady\">Tom Brady</a> was a healthy scratch after making the Patriots' roster in training camp; the guy who kept him, Bill Belichick, was taking over his first game as New England's coach.</p><p>The NFL we're about to watch in 2025 is very different, both in terms of aesthetic and presentation, than the one you followed 25 years ago. Offenses and defenses have evolved pre- and post-snap, although some innovations are clever repackagings of past concepts. Rules have changed. NFL teams that might not have needed or wanted computers 25 years ago are sorting through <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/24445965/player-tracking-data-next-step-nfl-analytics-revolution\">player tracking data</a>. It's almost impossible to pluck teams from two decades ago and compare them to the teams playing now.</p><p>Good thing it's only <em>almost</em> impossible, because guess what we're doing today? That's right: With 25 seasons in the books since the world celebrated the birth of the third millennium, I'm picking the 25 best teams of the past 25 years of professional football. If you could somehow take those 25 top teams from the past quarter century and get them to play one another, who would end up on top?</p><p><em><strong>Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=15230808\">'The Bill Barnwell Show'</a></strong></em></p><p>That's the question I'm trying to answer below, which requires some explanation. There are lots of ways to try to answer this question. Should it be a measure of which team was most successful? Which teams played the best on a snap-by-snap basis? Should I consider each team at its peak or over the entire season? What about accounting for shorter schedules and different playoff rules?</p><p>I tried to strike a balance. My goal is to find the best team if all of these teams could play each other in what amounts to a time-traveling <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.champions\">Champions League</a> of the past quarter century. I considered what every team did over the course of the entire season, all the way from Week 1 through the playoffs, as the best measure of its true underlying level of play. I tried to account for injuries to emulate what we actually saw play out during each team's real season. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/phi/season/2017\">2017 Eagles</a>, for example, are going to have <a data-player-guid=\"0a977ad1-142c-a3dd-ddd0-3c40f1b68fdd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14877/nick-foles\">Nick Foles</a> start about 31% of the time, since he took over for an injured <a data-player-guid=\"ed28fa2c-63a1-8258-b6b0-618e79d3e363\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573079/carson-wentz\">Carson Wentz</a> and played six of their 19 total games during their run to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400999173/eagles-patriots\">Super Bowl LII</a>.</p><p>At the same time, I wanted to reward teams that won championships. I weighted postseason performance as more significant than what happened during the regular season. I looked for teams that dominated their opposition, especially when those opponents were also among the league's best. I wanted to favor teams that were complete and controlled both sides of the ball, but I didn't want to leave out true outliers that were generationally impactful on offense or defense, especially if they rode those successes into the Super Bowl.</p><p>To compare their performance, with limited data for the earlier years of the century, I kept things simple. I measured each team's scoring offense and defense per game, including its postseason figures, and then normalized them against the league average. I'm going to include each team's percentile rank on offense and defense over the past 25 years by this measure, a number that is better when higher, with 100 as the peak. Where available, I tried to use advanced metrics to get more insight into each team's level of play.</p><p>I also focused on sustainable and strong underlying levels of play as opposed to teams that were spectacular in close games or managed to squeeze out victories each week. While all of the teams here won plenty of games, this isn't a list of win totals. As a good example, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/kc/season/2024\">2024 Chiefs</a> went 15-2 while winning close games with blocked field goals, fumbled snaps and bad game management by the opposing coach, but they weren't that caliber of team from their underlying level of play. You saw what happened to them against stiff competition in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671889/chiefs-eagles\">Super Bowl LIX</a>. They didn't make this list.</p><p>Finally, I measured strength of schedule using the Pythagorean formula. For each opponent a team faced in a given season, I calculated its points scored and points allowed in games not involving that team, then built an expected winning percentage off that formula. (In other words, to measure how tough of an opponent the Ravens were for the Steelers in a given year, I calculated how the Ravens performed in every game they played that didn't involve the Steelers.) Weighting for how often each team played each opponent, this average schedule difficulty helped inform the path each team took during its season.</p><p>With all of that in mind, for all the math and analysis, I asked myself one question when I was comparing a pair of teams on the list: Given everything we saw from each of these two teams over the course of their entire seasons, which would win if they met on a neutral field? Sometimes, that led to contradictory answers: There are teams on this list that lost to other teams that didn't make it or even come close. That might seem counterintuitive given that you literally saw that team win, but what happens on one day won't necessarily happen again. The Bills have beaten the Chiefs four straight times in the regular season; you know how things have gone when they've met in the playoffs.</p><p>I'll start with the honorable mention, then count down the best teams of the past 25 years:</p><p><strong>Jump to a legendary team:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45730439/ranking-25-best-nfl-teams-25-years-2000-patriots-eagles-seahawks#ravens\">2000 Ravens</a> | <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45730439/ranking-25-best-nfl-teams-25-years-2000-patriots-eagles-seahawks#bucs\">2002 Bucs</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45730439/ranking-25-best-nfl-teams-25-years-2000-patriots-eagles-seahawks#patriots\">2007 Patriots</a> | <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45730439/ranking-25-best-nfl-teams-25-years-2000-patriots-eagles-seahawks#packers\">2010 Packers</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45730439/ranking-25-best-nfl-teams-25-years-2000-patriots-eagles-seahawks#chiefs\">2019 Chiefs</a> | <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45730439/ranking-25-best-nfl-teams-25-years-2000-patriots-eagles-seahawks#eagles\">2024 Eagles</a></p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Honorable mention</h2><p>If I list every single team that garnered meaningful consideration, I'd be 10,000 words deep before even hitting the top 25. By restricting myself to 25 teams in 25 seasons, even my limited math is good enough to know I'm grabbing an average of one team per year. Though there are a couple of seasons in which I ended up taking two teams, think about <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoff-bracket\">2024</a> and what limiting ourselves to one team means. With the Eagles being my pick, that means the Chiefs don't make it. It also means no 15-2 Lions. No 14-3 Vikings. No 13-4 Bills with <a data-player-guid=\"853f8768-54bd-6a4f-cb10-63d6df1e7742\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>'s MVP campaign.

There are similar great teams from each of the past 25 years that simply get squeezed out.</p><p>With that in mind, I'm limiting the honorable mention discussion to the 12 teams that won the Super Bowl and didn't end up in the top 25. Obviously, winning pro football's biggest prize is a valuable item to put on a résumé -- I weighted things disproportionately in favor of teams that took home the Lombardi Trophy -- but I'm considering what those teams did over the entire <em>season</em>, not just how their campaign ended. Let's run through those teams and why I believe they came up short in this ranking:</p><p>Everyone remembers three moments for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ne/season/2001\"><b>2001 Patriots</b></a>: <a data-player-guid=\"9bfcc743-5a15-c688-ce14-492df1f45168\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/393/drew-bledsoe\">Drew Bledsoe</a> suffering <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/clayton_john/1256146.html\" target=\"_new\">internal bleeding on a September hit</a> and opening up the door for <a data-player-guid=\"be3c0e30-5a1e-8174-091d-a41bf4e2d51e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady\">Tom Brady</a>, the Tuck Rule game and <a data-player-guid=\"80e14c37-27c3-31a6-e768-c686b2e6c510\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1097/adam-vinatieri\">Adam Vinatieri</a>'s field goals in the snow to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220119017/raiders-patriots\">beat the Raiders</a>, and an incredible performance in upsetting the Greatest Show on Turf as 14-point underdogs in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220203017/rams-patriots\">Super Bowl XXXVI</a>.</p><p>What's lost to history is a good team that doesn't push its way into the top 25. Including their playoff run, these Patriots played the second-easiest schedule of any Super Bowl winner over the past 25 years, as they had just two wins over teams with winning records during the regular season. Their playoff wins were all narrow, although whatever good fortune they might have come across in the victory over the Raiders was offset by losing Brady to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs01/news/2002/0130/1320293.html\">an ankle injury</a> in the second quarter of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220127023/patriots-steelers\">AFC Championship Game</a>, with Bledsoe coming back in to help top <a data-player-guid=\"b72e61a8-dfd7-9579-d550-43511a45a8a3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/736/kordell-stewart\">Kordell Stewart</a> and the Steelers. Their best game of the season, quite comfortably, came in the Super Bowl. Many of the players on this team would eventually help turn New England into a dynasty, but there were much better versions of the Patriots to come.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/pit/season/2005\"><b>2005 Steelers</b></a> were 7-5 late in the season before going on an eight-game winning streak to claim <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/260205023/seahawks-steelers\">Super Bowl XL</a>. Some of those issues were due to <a data-player-guid=\"b941dabb-40e2-1086-e171-df0628618bf3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5536/ben-roethlisberger\">Ben Roethlisberger</a> missing four games with knee injuries, but Pittsburgh didn't even win its division.

In the Super Bowl, Roethlisberger posted a 22.6 passer rating and threw two picks, but the Steelers beat the Seahawks in a game marred by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=5444048\" target=\"_new\">dismal officiating</a>. They were survivors, but this wasn't even a great team by their lofty standards.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ind/season/2006\"><b>2006 Colts</b></a> were a great team when they had star safety <a data-player-guid=\"b0af01b3-d32c-c56b-008c-656c4b45080f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5569/bob-sanders\">Bob Sanders</a>, going 7-1 with him on the field. Sanders played just four regular-season games before returning for the playoffs, at which point the Colts ran the table, most famously with a comeback from 21-3 down <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/270121011/patriots-colts\">against the archrival Patriots</a> to finally get <a data-player-guid=\"78d91edb-3223-7991-5793-36664e222d79\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1428/peyton-manning\">Peyton Manning</a> his playoff win over <a data-player-guid=\"be3c0e30-5a1e-8174-091d-a41bf4e2d51e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady\">Tom Brady</a>. The Sanders-led defense forced 13 turnovers during a four-game playoff run, including five by <a data-player-guid=\"c3f40b73-45ae-221e-48fc-1f6c30fb6df8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4480/rex-grossman\">Rex Grossman</a> and the Bears in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/270204003/colts-bears\">Super Bowl XLI</a>.</p><p>Without Sanders for much of the season, the Colts finished 23rd in scoring defense. They were the league's worst third-down defense and the second-worst red zone defense during the regular season. Just taking the best version of this team and assuming Sanders could play 17 games, they would be in the top 25. As it stands, other versions of the Manning-era Colts make the list, even without a ring.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/nyg/season/2007\"><b>2007 Giants</b></a> produced what might have been the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280203017/giants-patriots\">most memorable victory</a> of the Super Bowl era, controlling the vaunted Patriots offense and coming up with <a data-player-guid=\"52069eb3-9563-e8d4-0df4-d3c3e1bed572\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4669/david-tyree\">David Tyree</a>'s famous <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/nfceast/post/_/id/62823/giants-top-play-1-tyrees-helmet-catch\">helmet catch</a> to set up a championship-winning touchdown.

They had a minus-nine turnover differential during the regular season, and while they played the Pats close in the last week, that followed an eight-game stretch in which <a data-player-guid=\"629fd2c1-6c50-e8e3-b307-99a84fab0d67\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5526/eli-manning\">Eli Manning</a> completed 51.1% of his passes and turned the ball over twice as often (14 times) as he produced touchdowns (seven, with six through the air.) This team had a great defensive line, and it hit a new stride when it leaned into its young talent during the postseason, but one snap before the helmet catch, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1QkoOUEgyc&amp;t=1h57m\">would-be interception</a> bounced off <a data-player-guid=\"4a6d749a-1b0c-6fee-6456-6e9ce381037d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4578/asante-samuel\">Asante Samuel</a>'s hands. If he had caught that pass, nobody would even pretend this is a debate. The Giants deserve all the credit in the world for what they accomplished, but I wouldn't like their chances against these teams over another 17-game season.</p><p>The good news is that no fans will be mad at me for also leaving the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/nyg/season/2011\"><b>2011 Giants</b></a> out of the top 25. Right? The 2011 version was actually outscored during the regular season, albeit while playing a tough schedule. The Giants were 7-7 in December and Manning was being <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/2011/12/21/10-questions-for-the-big-ny-giants-ny-jets-clash-answered-by-new-york-daily-news-beat-writers/\">unfavorably compared</a> to fellow New York quarterback <a data-player-guid=\"254e85b1-d83f-3a90-c134-ff12b7fe28c5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12482/mark-sanchez\">Mark Sanchez</a> before the team rolled off wins over the Jets and the Cowboys to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320101019/cowboys-giants\">win the NFC East</a> on the final day of the season.</p><p>The league's 25th-ranked scoring defense improved massively during the playoffs, with the Giants <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320108019/falcons-giants\">holding the Falcons</a> to a lone safety and then slowing down the 15-1 Packers in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320115009/giants-packers\">divisional round</a>. New York put up a great <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320122025/giants-49ers\">conference title game</a> performance against the 49ers, who did nothing on offense and went 1-for-13 on third down one week after dropping 36 points on the Saints. The Giants then forced an early safety from Tom Brady and shut out the Patriots for the final 26 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320205017/giants-patriots\">Super Bowl XLVI</a>, eventually winning 21-17.</p><p>Was there a bit of fortune during their playoff run?

As with 2007, this was another team that was great in the postseason and closer to league average during the regular season. It's tough to sneak in when there are so many teams that were good in both spots.</p><p>Like the Super Bowl-winning Colts, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/bal/season/2012\"><b>2012 Ravens</b></a> looked a lot better on defense during the postseason. <a data-player-guid=\"4841b102-7fff-30e5-7e09-a5310143414f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4468/terrell-suggs\">Terrell Suggs</a> missed the first half of the year, and <a data-player-guid=\"b2af036c-e8b9-6fe8-ca18-81cf019fd350\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/964/ray-lewis\">Ray Lewis</a> was limited to six regular-season games by injuries. By the end of the year, the Ravens didn't seem like a Super Bowl contender; they lost four of their final five games, limping into the postseason at 10-6.</p><p>Though Lewis wasn't anywhere near his peak, his return for the postseason helped spark the defense, which forced 10 turnovers in four games. The Ravens needed a miracle to make it past the Broncos in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/330112007/ravens-broncos\">divisional round</a> and got one when Denver safety <a data-player-guid=\"3172946e-d7e2-b91a-aabe-ca1b50faf5c4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14050/rahim-moore\">Rahim Moore</a> misjudged a <a data-player-guid=\"cfd567df-191e-29cf-0dc6-0bcf84085135\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco\">Joe Flacco</a> bomb with a seven-point lead and 43 seconds left, allowing <a data-player-guid=\"54a66e3c-9945-3370-be5f-95cd2695d6e6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5083297/jacoby-jones\">Jacoby Jones</a> to run past him for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmRYZOuXHrA\">70-yard score</a> to tie the game. The Ravens won in overtime, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/330120017/ravens-patriots\">beat the Patriots</a> in Foxborough and then won the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8912611/super-bowl-xlvii-ravens-49ers-soon-forgotten\">Harbaugh Bowl</a> against the 49ers in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/330203025/ravens-49ers\">Super Bowl XLVII</a>.</p><p>Flacco had the hottest stretch of his career at exactly the right time, posting a 117.2 passer rating and throwing nine touchdowns without a pick during the postseason. There's a significant span of time before and after suggesting that stretch is an outlier for the veteran passer. This wasn't the best Baltimore team of the Flacco/John Harbaugh era, but it was the one that had the best timing.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/ne/season/2014\"><b>2014 Patriots</b></a> might suffer from being compared with so many other Pats teams. (There are a few, as you can probably surmise, in the top 25.)

Leaving aside a meaningless <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400554438/bills-patriots\">Week 18 game</a>, the Pats went 13-1 after the loss in Kansas City.</p><p>The playoff run wasn't as dominant as others. They prevailed in a chaotic <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400749515/ravens-patriots\">35-31 game</a> against the Ravens, owing in part to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/12150444/2014-15-nfl-playoffs-league-says-new-england-patriots-substitutions-vs-baltimore-ravens-legal\" target=\"_new\">a substitution tactic</a> that was banned after the season.

The Broncos ranked 19th in scoring offense and 30th in turnovers (31).

If you thought they were good at the time, you had to argue with Brady, who <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25753861/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-says-everybody-thinks-suck\" target=\"_new\">insisted, \"Everybody thinks we suck and can't win any games\"</a> in his postgame chat after the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401038959/chargers-patriots\">divisional round victory</a> over the Chargers.

One week after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030957/rams-lions\">the Lions</a> put their edge rushers as far outside as possible to help force Los Angeles' zone runs back inside, Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's 6-1 front stifled the run game and forced Goff to be a pocket passer. He threw four picks in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030817/rams-bears\">15-6 loss</a>. The Eagles got the Rams again the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030961/eagles-rams\">following week</a>, and although Los Angeles came back with two victories against the dismal <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030907/rams-cardinals\">Cardinals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401030850/49ers-rams\">49ers</a> to end the regular season, warning bells were blaring.</p><p>After <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401038956/cowboys-rams\">beating the Cowboys</a> at home, the Rams were bailed out by their defense in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401038118/rams-saints\">NFC Championship Game</a> against the Saints. An overwhelmed offense struggled early and handed the Saints an early turnover, but the Rams held New Orleans to two short field goals early before a touchdown drive put them down 13-0. <a data-player-guid=\"70b6df7b-3187-9baa-b6f7-b9ce5849dc5b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16716/aaron-donald\">Aaron Donald</a> and the defense held the Saints to 10 points over their ensuing seven drives, aided <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/new-orleans-saints/post/_/id/31557/nfl-world-reacts-to-blown-interference-call-during-rams-saints-game\">at the end</a> by one of the most famous <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25812050/saints-never-get-blown-pass-interference-call\">missed pass interference calls</a> in league history, which gave the Rams time to drive and tie the game in regulation. <a data-player-guid=\"b609fcba-e177-1906-6da3-f94526248fec\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/7160/john-johnson\">John Johnson</a> picked off <a data-player-guid=\"a3d4f447-3aef-111a-ee5c-4909a8e70a7c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees\">Drew Brees</a> in overtime, and although the offense couldn't do much, <a data-player-guid=\"f70897fd-7dfa-01bc-6caf-166e058753e9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14993/greg-zuerlein\">Greg Zuerlein</a> hit a 57-yard field goal to send L.A. to its first Super Bowl under McVay.</p><p>There, with two weeks to prepare, Belichick hard-coded the Fangio approach into his defense. McVay and the Rams had no answer. The defense played its best game of the season, holding an excellent Patriots offense to 13 points on 11 possessions, but the Rams never found a way to get the Patriots out of their six-man fronts and couldn't get their dropback pass game going. They punted on their first eight drives and scored three points. It's still tied for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25921740/super-bowl-liii-was-greatest-defensive-performance-history-here-how-patriots-did-rams\">lowest total produced</a> by a McVay offense in a single game.</p><p>That loss eventually changed the league. The McVay and Shanahan-style offenses were forced to diversify their run concepts, modernizing what had become the league's favorite way to attack defenses. Goff wasn't quite as effective without the heavy play-action attack, and McVay eventually grew frustrated, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30682503/los-angeles-rams-move-defense-stifles-russell-wilson-seattle-seahawks\">quasi-benched him</a> for a playoff game against the Seahawks and then sent him to the Lions in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30808788/detroit-lions-dealing-matthew-stafford-los-angeles-rams-jared-goff-picks-sources-say\">salary dump</a> as part of the <a data-player-guid=\"20c41c33-a33f-6dc2-7e1f-0771e39ce49a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a> trade, which led to a title for the Rams and a resurgent Lions franchise.

In midseason, the Steelers stopped the Patriots from extending their 21-game winning streak, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/241031023/patriots-steelers\">beating them</a> by two touchdowns. The following week, they hosted the other team that would eventually compete in the Super Bowl and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/241107023/eagles-steelers\">routed the Eagles</a> 27-3. They ran a little hot, going 6-0 in one-score games, but every team runs a little hot when it goes 15-1.</p><p>The postseason just didn't go quite as well.

Over the final six games of the regular season, they allowed a total of 39 points. In our 25-year window, it's the <a href=\"https://stathead.com/tiny/DCp1o\" target=\"_new\">second-best six-game stretch</a> by points allowed behind a run from the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/pit/season/2000\">2000 Steelers</a>, who were playing in a league in which leaguewide scoring was 10% lower than it was in 2014.

Wilson threw for 3,475 yards and added 849 more with six scores as a runner, both of which would become career highs (barring something very unexpected happening with the 2025 Giants).

Facing the Packers in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400749519/packers-seahawks\">NFC Championship Game</a>, Wilson threw four interceptions, only to have his season saved by a <a href=\"https://grantland.com/the-triangle/afc-nfc-championship-patriots-colts-seahawks-packers/\">brutal stretch of in-game decision-making</a> by Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy. With a fake field goal for a touchdown, the world's shortest Hail Mary producing a 2-point conversion and a fateful onside kick recovery giving the Seahawks a late lead, the Packers still managed to push the game to overtime before Wilson hit <a data-player-guid=\"87f962af-ad29-a58b-e05e-35320f7feeed\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15428/jermaine-kearse\">Jermaine Kearse</a> for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvvAhF34Z8\">35-yard touchdown</a> to send the Seahawks to the Super Bowl.

After a spectacular play by Jackson for a 30-yard score in the first quarter, the Ravens weren't able to keep their offense going and seemed to get away from the run. The defense held Mahomes &amp; Co. to three points on their final nine drives, but by allowing a pair of touchdowns on the opening two possessions of the game, enough damage had been done for Kansas City to win.

Brown</a>. The Eagles had been passive and easy to throw on under defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon the season before, and although they had imported <a data-player-guid=\"8b6e917b-39b0-e82e-13e8-c8b0640b2fa0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980504/haason-reddick\">Haason Reddick</a> in free agency, it was unclear whether they had the defense to challenge opposing quarterbacks.</p><p>Those concerns faded sometime around September. Hurts had an MVP-caliber season, dramatically raising his game as a passer for the second consecutive season while continuing to make a massive impact in the designed run game. He threw for 3,701 yards and 22 scores and added 760 rushing yards and 13 more touchdowns on the ground. A <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35287572/sources-eagles-qb-jalen-hurts-sprained-shoulder\">shoulder injury</a> kept him out of two games in December and took him out of the MVP discussion, but he returned and played through the injury in Week 18 to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401437957/giants-eagles\">beat the Giants</a> and lock up a first-round bye for the Eagles.</p><p>Roseman's offseason additions were brilliant.

Reddick racked up 16 sacks, one of four Eagles in double digits; Gannon's defense finished with 70 sacks, the most by any team in this 25-year period.</p><p>The Eagles played the league's <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/\">third-easiest schedule</a> during the regular season, but they went 14-1 when Hurts started, winning those games by an average of more than 10 points. That trend continued in the postseason, when they got to face a Giants team that had been outscored in the regular season in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401438004/giants-eagles\">the divisional round</a> and a 49ers team that lost <a data-player-guid=\"d2e39a38-732d-5a24-f242-a4f9de87dabe\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361741/brock-purdy\">Brock Purdy</a> to an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35559440/source-49ers-qb-brock-purdy-torn-ucl-right-elbow\">elbow injury</a> early in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401438009/49ers-eagles\">conference title game</a>.

The Eagles won the two home games by a combined score of 69-14.</p><p>A Super Bowl against the Chiefs beckoned, and although Hurts played spectacularly, he dropped the ball on a scramble and handed the Chiefs a 36-yard score on a fumble return.

One good excuse is that they faced the second-most drives (213) of any team; they ranked 18th in points allowed per drive and 17th in defensive EPA per play, leaving them closer to league average than it seems. The other is that they were <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/84042/seahawks-super-bowl-win-a-slam-dunk\">shredded by the Seahawks</a> in the Super Bowl, which you'll read more about much later in this column.</p><p>With that being said, this offense was special enough to push those concerns aside.

Their three regular-season losses all came in one-score games. In the postseason, they gained some revenge for two of those three defeats, as they went up big on the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/340112007/chargers-broncos\">Chargers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/340119007/patriots-broncos\">Patriots</a> before some garbage-time scores.

They did this <i>despite</i> turning the ball over 44 times during the regular season, the second most of any team.

The defense held a high-powered Eagles team to 24 points in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/220127014/eagles-rams\">conference title game</a>, coming up with a late stop to set up a trip to the Super Bowl.</p><p>And, well, a dynasty started there, just not the one St. Louis fans were expecting.

A second defensive touchdown was called back for a holding penalty.

(They beat the Pats during the regular season <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/211118017/rams-patriots\">24-17</a>, although that game obviously mattered quite a bit less than the rematch.) And yet, it's only fair to point out that the Rams could be their own worst enemy at times, with that coming back to bite them in the biggest game. In a current era in which the average team turned the ball over just under 21 times in 17 games last season, it's tough to imagine a team with 44 turnovers in 16 games not having that come back to bite them more often. That's a testament to how great the 2001 Rams were when they didn't give up the ball and a reminder of what kept them from confirming their status as one of the greatest teams ever.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/kc.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>9. 2019 <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f68f2343-8ceb-7a02-740d-af6338be21d2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> (15-4)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Won <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401131047/49ers-chiefs\">Super Bowl LIV</a> over 49ers 31-20<br>\n<b>Offense:</b> 96th percentile<br>\n<b>Defense:</b> 74th percentile</p><p>The ultimate \"No lead is safe\" team, the Chiefs simply broke competitors' hearts.

In the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401131044/titans-chiefs\">AFC title game</a>, the Titans went up 10-0 in the first quarter before the Chiefs answered back, with a Patrick Mahomes scramble before halftime giving them a lead they wouldn't relinquish. Then, having struggled for most of the Super Bowl against the 49ers, the Chiefs converted a third-and-15 for 44 yards and scored three touchdowns in the final 6:13, speeding away from yet another deficit with what ended up as a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28624233/barnwell-super-bowl-liv-andy-reid-masterpiece-how-chiefs-came-back-49ers-blew-it\">relatively comfortable victory</a>.</p><p>Kansas City wasn't always playing from behind, of course.

A defense that had been 28th in points allowed per drive in 2018 jumped to 13th.

They lost four games during the regular season, and although one was with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11128/matt-moore\">Matt Moore</a> at quarterback for an injured Mahomes, they also lost three of their four games against the AFC South, including a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128053/colts-chiefs\">defeat to a Colts team</a> that would finish 7-9. Unlike the Eagles, who have fielded three truly dominant teams, three above-average ones and a disaster over the past eight seasons, the Chiefs have been consistently great without ever fielding a truly overwhelming squad, which makes it harder for them to do well in this exercise.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/gb.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>8. 2010 <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"06cd3bcf-7a86-53d4-28e7-aa049dd36261\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers\">Green Bay Packers</a> (14-6)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Won <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/310206009/steelers-packers\">Super Bowl XLV</a> over Steelers 31-25<br>\n<b>Offense:</b> 81st percentile<br>\n<b>Defense:</b> 98th percentile</p><p>Since I've suggested I'm willing to consider broader performance over what teams do at the end of the season, I can already hear you wondering why I didn't nominate the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/gb/season/2011\">2011 Packers</a>, who went 15-1 with <a data-player-guid=\"5fbab03e-2816-55ab-ae10-83b132803d9e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> winning MVP before <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/320115009/giants-packers\">losing to the Giants</a> in the postseason. Most of the difference between those two teams was close-game luck. The 2010 Packers went 4-6 in one-score games during the regular season, continuing what had been a frustrating start in narrow contests early in Rodgers' career. They then won three one-score games on their way to the Super Bowl and went 5-1 in those same contests during the 2011 season. Including the postseason, they won their games in 2010 by an average of 9.7 points and their games in 2011 by an average of 10.8. The two teams were more similar than their records suggest.</p><p>Rodgers had a better 2011 season, but he took a massive leap forward halfway through the 2010 campaign. Through a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/301031020/packers-jets\">Week 8 game</a> against the vaunted Jets defense, Rodgers ranked eighth in QBR, with the future Hall of Famer throwing nine picks and completing 61% of his passes. From Week 9 onward? He led the NFL in QBR, threw 25 touchdown passes against four picks, averaged a league-leading 8.9 yards per attempt and increased his completion percentage by nearly 10 full points. He had three sterling starts during the postseason, although he was bailed out of a rough <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/310123003/packers-bears\">NFC Championship Game</a> against the Bears when <a data-player-guid=\"0929f9fb-f84f-c278-09aa-42a850ec5b11\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9597/jay-cutler\">Jay Cutler</a> was injured, and Green Bay spent most of the game against <a data-player-guid=\"87c74181-32b9-6879-6671-cc9a11a0620e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11540/caleb-hanie\">Caleb Hanie</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"ba3ea6e2-6a4a-3f3e-0acd-3ec75710fd3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/735/todd-collins\">Todd Collins</a>.</p><p>And though Rodgers was better in 2011, the defense was superior in 2010.

Tom Brady had a solid season and finished third in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1698744\">MVP voting</a>, but this was another early-2000s title winner driven by a dominant defense.

After the Patriots missed the playoffs in 2002, the same skeptics who weren't impressed by Belichick's run in Cleveland were ready to write him off as an overmatched coach.</p><p>Well, the Patriots went 17-1 the rest of the way, including a 15-game win streak through the Super Bowl. Over that run, they went 10-0 against teams that won at least 10 games during the regular season, becoming the only team in NFL history to win double-digit games against double-digit winners. The defense produced three shutouts in the second half of the season, including a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/231227017/bills-patriots\">31-0 win</a> against the Bills to end the year.

His two most productive receivers on the day were <a data-player-guid=\"a733d6f0-17f6-7be3-3c3d-950fc30df6bd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045260/corey-clement\">Corey Clement</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"8be61cb9-4548-edd6-badb-7ba8c90818d5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971618/nelson-agholor\">Nelson Agholor</a>. On a day in which Tom Brady threw for 505 yards and three touchdowns, the Eagles needed Foles to be brilliant. He was nearly perfect.</p><p>This was a deep, talented football team with plenty of homegrown talent. Like the 2024 edition, the Eagles got some help from unexpected places. Clement had a big game in the Super Bowl, joining a backfield that included low-cost additions in LeGarrette Blount and <a data-player-guid=\"1b58dca6-ee7f-3c0b-6154-737516ab05d8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573300/jay-ajayi\">Jay Ajayi</a>. <a data-player-guid=\"81116fa6-0747-6ba3-6b27-5af0ac983c19\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11236/chris-long\">Chris Long</a>, who joined Blount in leaving the 2016 Patriots for the 2017 Eagles and winning rings in both places, added valuable depth to the defensive line rotation. Journeyman cornerback <a data-player-guid=\"bff02dab-ac6d-18c9-adef-0a1340375fc4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/7415/patrick-robinson\">Patrick Robinson</a>, moved into the slot role, had a career year. And of course, Foles had already nearly retired after his struggles with the Rams before <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/18896973/nick-foles-returning-philadelphia-eagles-two-year-deal\">returning to the Eagles</a> to play behind Wentz. These Eagles might not have had the same caliber of star power on offense as the 2024 team, but with a bit of perspective this squad looks more similar than I had remembered.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>4. 2024 <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d1a9b001-1df7-fbd7-ae4c-6ca7065286ec\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> (18-3)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Won <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671889/chiefs-eagles\">Super Bowl LIX</a> over Chiefs 40-22<br>\n<b>Offense:</b> 90th percentile<br>\n<b>Defense:</b> 96th percentile</p><p>You probably don't need me to refresh your memory too much with regard to these Eagles, so I'll keep this one simple. If we were leaving aside the first quarter of the season, I'd say they would have a reasonably strong case as the best team of the past 25 years. Before the bye, they went 2-2, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671691/falcons-eagles\">blowing a late lead</a> over the Falcons and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671740/eagles-buccaneers\">getting overwhelmed</a> by the Buccaneers in Tampa. They <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671805/packers-eagles\">won a sloppy affair</a> in Brazil over the Packers and needed a third-and-16 catch-and-run by <a data-player-guid=\"de06715d-5216-76ee-f063-dabb342c4225\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121023/dallas-goedert\">Dallas Goedert</a> for 61 yards with 1:16 left to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671736/eagles-saints\">avoid losing</a> to the Saints. Through four weeks, the Eagles ranked 26th in defensive EPA per play.</p><p>Afterward, with rookie <a data-player-guid=\"9c7274f7-268c-3559-b6eb-fec3738c9c65\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4682618/cooper-dejean\">Cooper DeJean</a> moving into the lineup as the team's slot corner, the Eagles were the league's best defense by EPA per snap. They were fifth best on offense. They proceeded to go 16-1 over the rest of the season into the playoffs, winning their games by an average of 14 points. Though the Rams came within 13 yards of ending their run with a late comeback in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671937/rams-eagles\">the divisional round</a>, the Eagles <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671888/commanders-eagles\">stomped the Commanders</a> in their rubber match a week later and then <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43772100/super-bowl-2025-how-eagles-dominated-chiefs-mahomes-hurts-defense-barnwell\">ripped apart the Chiefs</a> in the Super Bowl, going up 40-6 before a pair of garbage-time touchdowns.</p><p>The story of the season was <a data-player-guid=\"94486c18-dd3e-6081-a3fe-4a26b71ddcdc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley\">Saquon Barkley</a>, who put together <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42857976/saquon-barkley-sets-eagles-single-season-rushing-mark\">one of the best seasons ever</a> by a running back.

After the Eagles turned the ball over eight times during the first four games of the season, they had only eight more across their remaining 17 contests.</p><p>Realistically, you can make a strong case the Eagles were two drops away from going 20-1. In Week 2, Barkley <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41295933/eagles-saquon-barkley-shoulders-blame-game-changing-drop\">dropped a pass</a> that would have allowed them to run the clock out, with Philadelphia kicking a field goal before <a data-player-guid=\"53bec012-c2ed-bc7c-a8d5-438611f9faa1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a> drove the length of the field for a winning score. Then, in Week 16, <a data-player-guid=\"79fe15c5-5f05-f939-c4f5-c55466521a50\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241478/devonta-smith\">DeVonta Smith</a> dropped a pass with 2:07 to go that would have allowed the Eagles to run the clock down before kicking a short field goal to go up five. Instead, <a data-player-guid=\"f03f3238-b035-6f0e-5844-1529ca021c3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426348/jayden-daniels\">Jayden Daniels</a> got the ball back and drove the length of the field for a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671717/eagles-commanders\">winning touchdown</a>.</p><p>And yet, at the same time, the Eagles weren't always dominant against some middling opposition. They nearly lost to the Saints before that Goedert third-and-forever conversion. They <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671714/browns-eagles\">beat the Browns</a> by only four, needed a red zone interception with 1:13 to go to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671797/jaguars-eagles\">beat the Jaguars</a> and were lucky to escape Carolina <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671713/panthers-eagles\">with a win</a> after an open <a data-player-guid=\"a286b774-0d65-9813-67aa-945ba3567e4e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430034/xavier-legette\">Xavier Legette</a> dropped a would-be touchdown that should have given the Panthers a lead in the final minute.</p><p>In time, those narrow victories fade into history, and we remember each team's best moments. At their best, on the biggest stage, the Eagles were ruthless and overwhelming. They deserve to be considered as one of the best teams of the past 25 years right now, and they might look even better with some perspective down the line.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ne.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>3. 2004 <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0078f353-fe3e-67ed-a42c-43cca0568e21\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots</a> (17-2)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Won <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/250206021/patriots-eagles\">Super Bowl XXXIX</a> over Eagles 24-21<br>\n<b>Offense:</b> 91st percentile<br>\n<b>Defense:</b> 92nd percentile</p><p>This was the best Super Bowl-winning team of the Brady era.

By my model, including the postseason, this was the second-toughest schedule any team has faced over the past 25 years, trailing only the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/nyj/season/2000\">2000 Jets</a>. The Patriots faced both a 12-4 Colts team and a 15-1 Steelers squad twice, winning three of those four contests. They dominated both of those teams in the postseason, topping the Colts <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/250116017/colts-patriots\">20-3</a> in the divisional round before enacting revenge on the Steelers, who were on a 14-game winning streak of their own, with a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/250123023/patriots-steelers\">41-27 victory</a>. They then controlled the Super Bowl against a 13-3 Eagles team before a late score made things look close.</p><p>Though Brady wasn't quite at the heights he would hit in 2007 and beyond, the offense was taken to the next level by the addition of <a data-player-guid=\"aebf5c90-84c2-da79-57ff-b1c0a57fb48a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1196/corey-dillon\">Corey Dillon</a>, who ran for 1,635 yards and 12 scores. The defense forced turnovers on a league-high 20% of possessions and added 10 more turnovers in three games during the title run. Vinatieri was nearly perfect, missing just two of the 96 kicks he attempted between the regular season and playoffs.

They're going to send three players to the Hall of Fame in Wagner, Sherman and Wilson, and they were deep enough along the line of scrimmage to have Avril and Bennett in situational pass-rush roles. They forced 39 turnovers and scored four touchdowns. They inspired a defensive revolution among teams that tried to emulate their single-high approach and failed.</p><p>The difference between these Seahawks and the other dominant defenses, like the 2000 Ravens and 2002 Bucs, is that the offense was better. This team had <a data-player-guid=\"bfe8805c-d0ae-d234-923c-855ea34f620e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10456/marshawn-lynch\">Marshawn Lynch</a> running for 1,257 yards and 12 touchdowns before adding 288 yards and four more scores during the playoff run.

The Broncos snapped the ball into the end zone for a safety on the opening snap and didn't get much better from there, as they didn't have any answers for Seattle's physicality. Denver's lone scoring drive came while trailing 36-0 in the third quarter.</p><p>The only reason this Seattle team isn't No. 1? It was sloppy at times during the regular season. The Seahawks went to overtime to beat the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/330929034/seahawks-texans\">2-14 Texans</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/331103026/buccaneers-seahawks\">4-12 Buccaneers</a>, needed a goal-line stop on the final snap to beat the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/331028014/seahawks-rams\">7-9 Rams</a> and gave up 34 points to the Colts in an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/331006011/seahawks-colts\">early-season defeat</a> at home. The offense went missing in a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/331222026/cardinals-seahawks\">late-season loss</a> to the Cardinals. This is nit-picking, but the margins at the very top are thin. This was a special team, and I went back and forth with the idea of picking them to top the list. Very narrowly, though, if I had to pick one team to beat them, I'd lean toward the best version of the quarterback and the franchise that got them to the Super Bowl the following season.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ne.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>1. 2007 <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0078f353-fe3e-67ed-a42c-43cca0568e21\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots</a> (18-1)</h2><p><b>Fate:</b> Lost <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280203017/giants-patriots\">Super Bowl XLII</a> to Giants 17-14<br>\n<b>Offense:</b> 99th percentile<br>\n<b>Defense:</b> 94th percentile</p><p>No, the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20274149/build-influence-legacy-2007-new-england-patriots-how-nearly-perfect-team-changed-nfl\">best team</a> of the past 25 years did not win a Super Bowl.

Of course not. Samuel didn't and Tyree did, and it's why these Patriots aren't the most successful team of the past 25 years, even if they came within moments of being the first 19-0 team in league history.</p><p>We're using how each team played over the full season to evaluate their chances of winning in a new season, though, and there's no contest there. Even if we factor in what the Giants did during the playoffs and give them extra credit for beating the Patriots when it mattered most, that team <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/nyg/season/2007\">lost six times</a>, including a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/271125019/vikings-giants\">24-point loss</a> to the Vikings with <a data-player-guid=\"fc975ce1-f6fe-f202-4161-b8ea62daed32\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9650/tarvaris-jackson\">Tarvaris Jackson</a> under center. They <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/271229019/patriots-giants\">lost to the Patriots</a> in Week 17 in a game in which they famously were <a href=\"https://www.giants.com/news/2007-regular-season-finale-new-england-patriots-tom-coughlin-john-madden\">trying their hardest</a> to compete, even with nothing to play for. Those games also matter in evaluating their true level of talent.</p><p>Over a full year, it's tough to find a team that can realistically compete with the 2007 Pats, even with Super Bowl wins on their résumé. They were the only one-loss team of the era. They had the largest average margin of victory (17.5 points) by more than a field goal over the next-best team. The 2000 Ravens were the only team with a better pythagorean expectation over the regular season and postseason combined.</p><p>You remember (or have heard about) the offense, but the defense wasn't too shabby, either. The Patriots ranked sixth in EPA per play and fourth in points allowed per drive. The defense contributed six touchdowns during the regular season, which seems almost unfair given what the offense was doing on a weekly basis. Getting to play from ahead as often as they did obviously made life easier for <a data-player-guid=\"9414efae-23dd-bc6c-1925-bb2f42c0b1e6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/1257/mike-vrabel\">Mike Vrabel</a> &amp; Co., but even with win probability constraints on their performance and measure what they did when each team had at least a 20% chance of winning, New England ranked fourth in third-down conversion rate and QBR allowed.</p><p>The Patriots' schedule ended up being tougher than you might remember. Before the Giants loss, they won all eight of their games against 10-plus win competition, prevailing by an average of nearly two touchdowns. Things were a little friendlier in the postseason when they got to face a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280120017/chargers-patriots\">Chargers team</a> without <a data-player-guid=\"59049c9e-de83-4d26-dbb0-5e9ffe94186e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2553/ladainian-tomlinson\">LaDainian Tomlinson</a> for much of the day while <a data-player-guid=\"a7d4c3f1-4297-af47-1b05-c8fa86cc815e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5529/philip-rivers\">Philip Rivers</a> played through a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/292302/that-time-philip-rivers-played-through-a-torn-acl-in-the-playoffs\">torn ACL</a>. The Super Bowl gave them the 4-seed in the NFC, thanks to the Giants knocking out <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280113006/giants-cowboys\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/280120009/giants-packers\">13-win teams</a> along the way. That seemed easy until it wasn't.</p><p>To be fair, the Patriots slipped a bit as the season went along. They needed a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/271125017/eagles-patriots\">fourth-quarter comeback</a> to beat an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2704/aj-feeley\">A.J.

They weren't great against that compromised Chargers team in the AFC Championship Game, with Brady throwing three picks. And while they might have been unlucky to have the Giants fall on all three fumbles in the Super Bowl, Tom Coughlin's team beat them up on the line of scrimmage and was hardly lucky to win.</p><p>I've already <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20284825/the-tom-brady-bill-belichick-shift-how-2007-new-england-patriots-super-bowl-spygate-changed-everything\">written at length</a> about the stylistic and schematic legacy of that 2007 team, so I won't reiterate all that again. I'm not considering aesthetic impact here, but it's tough to pick another team that was more influential or striking on the league to come. The 2007 Patriots did everything except win a Super Bowl. If you put them against every other team on this list on a neutral field, I believe they're the team that would take home a title.</p>\n</div></div>"

The MMA world's attention will appropriately be on the main event, but it's not the only significant fight.</p><p>Several intriguing storylines weave through Saturday's undercard. UFC title challenger Paulo Costa stress tests himself against a dangerous contender, while Patricio Pitbull hopes for a strong sequel to his disappointing UFC debut. Then there's Kevin Holland's curious rehabilitation process. Dedicated MMA fans might also look forward to Marvin Vettori vs. Brendan Allen, who've angled to fight each other for years, and once got physical in a casino lobby.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's look closer at three undercard fights and a couple of honorable mentions worth your attention.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-318-fight-card-dustin-poirier-vs-max-holloway-3-five-biggest-storylines-to-watch-for-in-new-orleans/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>UFC 318 fight card -- Dustin Poirier vs. Max Holloway 3: Five biggest storylines to watch for in New Orleans</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brent Brookhouse                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"UFC 318 fight card -- Dustin Poirier vs. Max Holloway 3: Five biggest storylines to watch for in New Orleans\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/15/d1efac02-3db1-401a-8476-fe055728bb5a/thumbnail/270x152/3be249de03fe673bddf631e88c1dd1cc/dustin-poirier-war-hat-2024.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Paulo Costa vs. Roman Kopylov</h2><p>UFC 317 took a hit when Costa vs. Kopylov was scrapped from the card. Fortunately, it didn't take long to salvage the fight. They are two of the middleweight division's most powerful strikers. Costa and Kopylov play veteran and prospect, respectively, despite both being 34. Kopylov showed pliability since losing to Anthony Hernandez, evolving his wrestling. Costa's commitment to mixed martial arts is often in question, but it's a pleasure to see him fight. Costa has enough fan cache to reward the winner with a significant follow-up. Hopefully, both men are confident in their striking because anything else would be a disappointment.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n\n<h2>Dan Ige vs. Patricio Pitbull</h2><p>Pitbull laid an egg in his UFC debut. Pitbull, lauded as Bellator's greatest champion, looked muted against Yair Rodriguez. It wasn't entirely surprising -- Pitbull, 38, previously said he'd <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/patricio-pitbull-say-he-will-never-be-the-same-after-suffering-career-altering-injury-and-undergoing-surgery/\" target=\"_blank\">\"never\" be the same</a></span>&nbsp;after a career-altering neck surgery. This fight is far more suitable for where he's probably at. Perennial contender Ige has often served as gatekeeper to the featherweight elite. Sean Woodsen, for example, failed that test via TKO. Pitbull is far from a prospect, but Ige is the perfect foil to gauge what he can muster in a late-career UFC run. For Ige, it's a chance to add a significant name to his resume without fighting the absolute best.</p><h2>Kevin Holland vs. Daniel Rodriguez</h2><p>Could Holland be a real contender again? Holland surged to the forefront with five wins in 2020 and an infectious personality. Everything fell apart shortly after. Holland lost approximately two-thirds of his fights in the next four years. Holland's grappling defense and maturity were called into question. He seemed unmotivated when losing fights and bounced between divisions unstrategically. Earlier this year, Holland committed to welterweight. The results were performance bonus showcases against Gunnar Nelson and Vicente Luque. Against Rodriguez, Holland faces another welterweight striker on the rebound. Rodriguez knocked out Santiago Ponzinibbio, his second win since snapping a career-first losing streak. Hands will fly this one as a 170-pound contender is reborn.</p>\n        \n\n\n<p><strong>Honorable mentions:</strong> Marvin Vettori vs. Brendan Allen, Michael Johnson vs. Daniel Zellhuber</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

The Real Madrid forward's disappearance from the team at the end of last season -- not featuring once since being hauled off at half-time in the Copa del Rey final -- sparked speculation that he could be on the move. Sources told ESPN that the Brazilian would prefer to stay at Madrid but wanted to play on the left, not the right, and was waiting to hear new coach Xabi Alonso's plans before making any decisions.</p><p>His involvement at the Club World Cup only increased the doubts. He played 65 minutes against Al Hilal, followed by 23 minutes against Salzburg and just four minutes against Borussia Dortmund, with no involvement at all in the knockout ties with Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain. Alonso called him \"important\" and \"a special player,\" as you'd expect, but the coach's decisions so far haven't backed up that assessment. Opportunities on the front line are now going to be even more scarce than previously, given the eruption of Gonzalo Garcia stateside, and with Franco Mastantuono -- another talented young wide forward -- joining in August.</p><p>So what now? Madrid's players are enjoying a well-earned rest ahead of a return to preseason training and their first LaLiga game on Aug. 19. And Arsenal have now been joined by Liverpool in being linked with a bid for Rodrygo. ESPN has reported that Madrid would only consider a transfer if the player asked to leave, and even then, it wouldn't be straightforward, given the club's expectation of a sizeable fee and Rodrygo's salary demands. Don't expect a resolution anytime soon.</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0716/r1519644_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>CONFIRMED TRANSFERS</h2><p>- United States national team midfielder <strong>Johnny Cardoso</strong> has completed a transfer to Atlético Madrid from Real Betis, signing a five-year contract. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45342199/usa-midfielder-johnny-cardoso-joins-atletico-madrid\" target=\"_blank\">Read</a></p><p>- Chelsea goalkeeper <strong>Djordje Petrovic</strong> , who made 23 appearances last season on loan at French club Strasbourg, has completed a move to Bournemouth.</p><p>- Championship side Derby County have signed Charlotte FC and United States striker <strong>Patrick Agyemang</strong> for a fee in the region of $7 million. <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45747642/usa-agyemang-move-championship-derby\" target=\"_blank\">Read</a></strong></p><p>- West Ham United have signed Senegal international left-back <strong>El Hadji Malick Diouf</strong> from Slavia Prague.</p><p>- Aston Villa have signed goalkeeper <strong>Marco Bizot </strong>from Brest.</p><h2>OTHER RUMORS</h2><p>- Inter Milan are prioritizing a move for Atalanta winger <strong>Ademola Lookman</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/inter/2025/07/16-142023205/mercato_inter_lookman_la_priorit_chivu_lo_vuole_ma_servono_50_milioni\" target=\"_blank\">Corriere Dello Sport</a>).</p><p>- Manchester United are lining up a move for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion left-back <strong>Pervis Estupiñán</strong> (<a href=\"https://talksport.com/football/3381280/man-united-transfer-brighton-pervis-estupinan/\" target=\"_blank\">talkSPORT</a>).</p><p>- Barcelona defender <strong>Ronald Araújo</strong> is expected to stay put this summer after his representatives failed to find a suitable potential destination (<a href=\"https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/ronald-araujo-queda-barca-ahora-119707922\" target=\"_blank\">Diario Sport</a>).</p><p>- The Paris Saint-Germain Feminine trio of midfielder <strong>Grace Geyoro</strong>, left-back <strong>Sakina Karchaoui</strong> and defender <strong>Thiniba Samoura</strong> are being watched by clubs across Europe following their performances for France at the European Championships (<a href=\"https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Geyoro-karchaoui-samoura-le-psg-menace-sur-le-marche/1578376\" target=\"_blank\">L'Equipe</a>).</p><p>- USMNT midfielder <strong>Yunus Musah</strong> and winger <strong>Samuel Chukwueze</strong> are among the eight players that AC Milan are looking to move on from in the current transfer window (<a href=\"https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Calciomercato/Milan/storie/15-07-2025/milan-musah-e-bennacer-a-okafor-e-chukwueze-quanti-uomini-in-uscita/bennacer.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Gazzetta dello Sport</a>).</p><p>- Liverpool are willing to part ways with midfielder <strong>Tyler Morton</strong>, who is on the radar of West Ham United (<a href=\"https://www.teamtalk.com/west-ham-united/slot-prepared-cut-ties-midfielder-prem-rivals-attack-reds-pair\" target=\"_blank\">TEAMtalk</a>).</p><p>- A deal in principle has been agreed to between Leeds United and Newcastle United for midfielder <strong>Sean Longstaff</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6479621/2025/07/15/sean-longstaff-leeds-transfer-newcastle/\" target=\"_blank\">The Athletic</a>).</p><p>- Borussia Dortmund defender <strong>Tyler Meiser</strong> is set to join Borussia Mönchengladbach (<a href=\"https://x.com/plettigoal/status/1945185328190644256?s=46\" target=\"_blank\">Florian Plettenberg</a>).</p><p>- RB Leipzig striker <strong>Benjamin Sesko</strong> has no interest in a switch to the Saudi Pro League.

Gardner-Johnson was traded to the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> just a month after helping the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> win <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> LIX, a move widely seen as a salary cap dump.

Gardner explained his perspective <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wRClkZ-nOdk?si=AAaEeZi3jdu-IRBV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">on \"The Pivot\" podcast</a>, saying the Eagles didn't move him for financial reasons -- they moved him out of fear.</p><p>\"Scared of a competitor,\" Gardner-Johnson said. \"Simple as that. ...

The <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> star recorded the franchise's first receiving \"triple crown\" in 2024, leading the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in catches, yards and touchdowns. He then parlayed that production into a $161 million contract, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/highest-paid-players-at-every-nfl-position-jets-sauce-gardner-chiefs-trey-smith-latest-to-make-history/\" target=\"_blank\">becoming the highest-paid pass catcher in football</a></span>. Now he's got his sights set on a new feat: 2,000 receiving yards in a season.</p><p>Speaking with CBS Sports this week as part of a new partnership with General Mills, the All-Pro said the NFL's first 2,000-yard receiving season is \"closer than people expect.\" One year after <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> eclipsed the mark as a rusher for the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champion <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, Chase predicts wideouts will soon follow suit.</p><p>\"The next three years, somebody has to do it,\" he said, \"if it's not me.\"</p><p>So which receivers are the safest bets to break <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/502629/calvin-johnsons/\">Calvin Johnson's</a> all-time record of 1,964 yards?</p><p>\"Me and Justin, of course,\" Chase said, alluding to fellow LSU product <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871343/justin-jefferson/\">Justin Jefferson</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Fittingly, both Chase and Jefferson are part of General Mills' Cereal Training Camp series, appearing on limited-edition boxes after Jason and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1725130/travis-kelce/\">Travis Kelce</a> did the same last offseason. The wideouts will also be joined by <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967690/amon-ra-st-brown/\">Amon-Ra St. Brown</a> on collector's editions of Reese's Puffs starting Sept. 4. Before then, a flexing Chase will headline special boxes of Lucky Charms starting in August; it's a nod to the Bengals playmaker's colorful celebrations, including the \"Lucky Strut,\" as well as his place among the game's best.</p><p>Speaking of the best, how does Chase stack up against the all-timers? Off the top of his head, here's how the Bengals standout said he would construct the perfect NFL receiver:</p><p>\"I would use <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131163/tyreek-hills/\">Tyreek Hill's</a> speed,\" he said. \"I'd use Megatron's strength. I'd use Jerry Rice's routes. I'd use <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272852/antonio-browns/\">Antonio Brown's</a> hands.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>And if he could only use receivers from LSU's vaunted pipeline?</p><p>\"Josh Reed's speed,\" he said. \"<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824833/jarvis-landrys/\">Jarvis Landry's</a> routes. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824823/odell-beckham-jr-s/\">Odell Beckham Jr.'s</a> hands. And I'll use my strength.\"</p><p>What's next for Chase, besides cementing his place among the greats? He knows the Bengals offense is \"gonna have to do what we did last year\" to keep up in the AFC North, adding that \"the defense is gonna have to step up ... and make some stops; that's all we ask them to do.\" He acknowledges rivals like the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> could pose a bigger challenge \"now that they have true No. 1 corners\" after the acquisition of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071515/jalen-ramsey/\">Jalen Ramsey</a>. But none of it fazes his own confidence.</p><p>Just don't bank on him pouring an actual bowl of Lucky Charms as part of his next celebration.</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"Yeah, if I don't get fined,\" he laughed, when asked if he'd consider it. \"If you pay the fine, yes.\"</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

With golf's best converging in the United Kingdom for the second week in a row and Portrush hosting for the third time in course history, the key question everyone's asking is the same across the golf world: Who are you picking to win the 153rd playing of The Open Championship, the oldest golf tournament in the world.</p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-british-open-picks-favorites-ranking-the-top-of-the-field-from-1-25-with-predictions-for-royal-portrush/\" target=\"_blank\">With an exceptional field</a></span> featuring the best professionals in the world, the final major championship of 2025 should be an epic ride from Thursday's first round through the awarding of the Claret Jug on Sunday. Scottie Scheffler enters as the clear 9/2 favorite atop the odds board, but Rory McIlroy -- in his homecoming -- is not far behind. Scheffler remains on an all-time run across the last few seasons, and with a PGA Championship in tow, he has an opportunity to complete the third leg of the career grand slam this week.</p><p>McIlroy consummated that historic achievement three months ago at the Masters, his first major win in a over a decade. Now returning home, the Ulsterman has an opportunity to overcome the severe disappointment he experienced six years ago when he ejected on the first hole and missed the cut at Royal Portrush.</p><p>Joining that duo in receiving an enhanced level of attention this week is Jon Rahm, who has yet to win since joining LIV Golf but remains playing quality golf. Whether Rahm can put it all together and add a Claret Jug to his collection remains to be seen, but he may be entering this tournament more equipped to win a major than in any other attempt this season. Elsewhere, keep an eye on Irishman Shane Lowry, Scotsman Robert MacIntyre and Englishman Tommy Fleetwood. All have showcased the game to get it done at a course like Royal Portrush with Lowry serving as the last Champion Golfer of the Year at this course in 2019.</p>\n        \n\n<p>So, what is going to happen at Royal Portrush this week? Let's take a look at a full set of predictions and picks from our CBS Sports experts as we attempt to project who will win -- and what will go down -- at the final major championship of the season.</p><h2>2025 Open Championship picks, expert predictions</h2><p><em>Odds via <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\">Caesars Sportsbook</a></em></p><h3><em>Patrick McDonald, golf writer </em></h3><p><strong>Winner -- Tyrrell Hatton (33-1): </strong>He was the preseason pick, and we are not wavering in our belief. Hatton had his chance at the U.S. Open before a bogey-bogey finish to wind up T4 at Oakmont. He has since added a quality outing on LIV Golf. His links golf résumé is stellar with three wins in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and a couple of solid runs in this championship, including a T6 in 2019 at Royal Portrush.</p><p><strong>Sleeper -- Maverick McNealy (110-1): </strong>The American has struck out in his prior two Opens, but McNealy has made it known that he loves to play golf along the water. Some of his best results come on seaside coastal golf courses, and this year, he finally brings his game across the pond along with his affinity for the challenge. McNealy put together a solid showing at the Scottish Open and has made the cut in the first three majors this season. I reckon he does a little better than that this week and jumps onto the first or second page of the leaderboard.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Top 10 lock -- Scottie Scheffler: </strong>Tried to get fancy at the U.S. Open, but if the free space is given to you on the bingo card, then you should use it. Scheffler has seven top-25 finishes in his eight starts on links golf courses, and Royal Portrush may be the best fit for his game. The topography, the added moisture in the land and the undulations in the greens don't scream traditional links golf, but they scream a great fit for Scheffler's game. He remains a beast from tee to green, and if he putts well -- which he has not done in Europe -- he will be in with a chance come late Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Star who definitely won't win -- Ludvig Åberg: </strong>Justin Thomas may have fallen out of star category, so we'll pick on Åberg instead. The Swedish superstar is making a lot of young man's mistakes at the moment -- chasing sucker pins, failing to get easy up-and-downs in for par, etc. He's like watching the fastest F1 car on the track but knowing something is going to awry at some point in the race. What little major championship experience he does have has not been good outside of Augusta National.</p><p><strong>Scottie Scheffler vs. Rory McIlroy vs. Jon Rahm: </strong>Scheffler finishes inside the top five, Rahm inside the top 10 and McIlroy finds a way into the top 20 thanks to a strong final round that will get the local Northern Ireland crowd ready to roar as the leaders tee off on Sunday. The world No. 1's game is primed for this challenge as a second-shot golf course that requires a flair of creativity which he is often not given his flowers for. Meanwhile, many eyes will be on Rahm as a trendy pick to win given his form and links golf experience. From tee to green as a whole, he just is not quite as sharp as Scheffler as it stands which puts him second among this trio ahead of McIlroy, whose ball striking has been mixed lately.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Surprise prediction -- Jordan Spieth contends: </strong>LEROY JENKINS! He is the man who possesses the lowest cumulative score to par in Open history. He is the man who possesses seven straight top-25 finishes in this tournament. He is the man who has never missed the cut in his Open career. If there is ever a tournament for Spieth to turn back the clock, it is this one. He was in fine form before a withdrawal at the Travelers Championship, and if he is able to pick up where he left off, he will be able to pick this place apart.</p><p><strong>Lowest round: </strong>64 (-7)<br><strong>Winning score: </strong>272 (-12)<br><strong>Winner's Sunday score: </strong>68 (-3)</p><h3><em>Robby Kalland, golf writer</em></h3><p><strong>Winner -- Jon Rahm (12-1): </strong>Rahm is in really good form right now. He's even starting to look like his old self again at the majors. He finished second last week at LIV Golf Andalucía in his tune-up event in Spain and has back-to-back top 10s at the PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Now he heads to The Open where he's been terrific in recent years with three top 10s in the last four years (including a runner-up and a T3), and this week will be his time to add a Claret Jug to his collection.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sleeper -- Cameron Young (80-1): </strong>Young has two top 10 finishes in three Open starts and is coming off a T4 at the U.S. Open, as he's started showing signs of life again after some struggles early in the year. He's always been a guy that seems to find his best stuff at the majors, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him with a late tee time on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Top 10 lock -- Jordan Spieth:</strong> Lock is a strong word here, but my favorite top 10 bet this week is Spieth at 9/2. He has five top 10s in 11 starts at the Open and hasn't finished outside the top 25 since 2016. There's certainly some concern about his neck injury, but if he's full strength, I expect him to be a contender this week as the Open brings out the best in his game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Star who definitely won't win -- Bryson DeChambeau: </strong>DeChambeau's game just doesn't align well with links golf. He's a high ball hitter, which is part of why he's so good at U.S. Opens where his superpower is being able to stop the ball on those greens. The Open requires you to flight your ball and play a ground game, and he's never quite figured out that formula with one top 10 in his career (T8 in 2022) and no other finishes better than T33.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scottie Scheffler vs. Rory McIlroy vs. Jon Rahm:</strong> I've got Rahm winning, so we'll roll with the Spaniard here. McIlroy will perform well this time in his home Open, and Scheffler is a walking top 10, but I just feel like it's Rahm's time. Ideally, all three of these guys will be in the mix on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Surprise prediction -- Dean Burmester first round leader (90-1): </strong>Burmester was in the top 5 after 36 holes last year, and I could see the South African putting together a low score in the early going and leaping to the top of the leaderboard before eventually fading away over the course of 72 holes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lowest round:</strong> 64 (-7)<br><strong>Winning score: </strong>&nbsp;271 (-13)<br><strong>Winner's Sunday score:</strong> 68 (-3)</p><hr><h3><em>Adam Silverstein, senior director of editorial</em></h3><p><strong>Winner -- Rory McIlroy (7-1):</strong> Is McIlroy the best value? No. Is there a possibility he either ejects (like in 2019) or never comes close to contention due to the pressure that will be squarely on his shoulders? Absolutely. What's also true is that McIlroy has a greater familiarity with Royal Portrush than anyone else playing in The Open, he set the course record (61) when he was 16 years old, and he just finished second at the Scottish Open where none of the other Open favorites came within four shots of the Ulsterman. As was the case with the Masters this year, I have no desire to be on the wrong side of McIlroy making history.</p><p><strong>Sleeper -- Jordan Spieth (60-1):</strong> Forget his level of play lately, He's on a three-year winning drought without a top 10 at a major since the 2023 Masters, but Spieth comes alive on links courses. &nbsp;He also has four top 10s this season and a little extra pep in his step after his wife gave birth to their third child. Some may be concerned about the neck injury that pushed Spieth out of the Travelers Championship, but that was literally the first time he had withdrawn from an event in his entire career. At odds this great, Spieth is absolutely a sleeper -- one worth taking.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Top 10 lock -- Scottie Scheffler:</strong>&nbsp;While The Open may be his \"worst\" major, if there's one thing Scheffler does, it's learn from his mistakes. That's not to suggest he plays poorly in this tournament -- his four career starts resulted in finishes of T8, T1, T23 and T7 -- but rather he has not perfected links golf like he has Augusta National or courses in the PGA Championship rotation. Still, there is no one easier to trust as a contention lock than Scheffler. Even if he gets off to a rough start, he'll pile on the birdies over the weekend for a backdoor finish.</p><p><strong>Star who definitely won't win -- Bryson DeChambeau: </strong>He's the easy and correct pick for his space both due to his name and frustrating play on links courses. Outside of a single top 10 in 2022, he has never finished better than T33 at The Open, missing three cuts in seven starts. That's not someone you back no matter how much you may like his YouTube videos. Here's a bonus: Jon Rahm. I'm far less confident in singling him out, but it's important to remember this category is not suggesting the picks won't play well but rather that they will not win. Rahm has been doing a lot of not winning on LIV Golf, and the competition is even deeper in Northern Ireland.</p><p><strong>Scottie Scheffler vs. Rory McIlroy vs. Jon Rahm:</strong>&nbsp;If you cannot tell already, the order of operations here is crystal clear: McIlroy on top followed by Scheffler inside the top 10 and Rahm probably around the top 15. If Scheffler is outside the top 10 but inside the top 20 entering the weekend, consider a play as there should finally be a level of value created for him.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Surprise prediction -- :&nbsp;</strong>Burmester was in the top 5 after 36 holes last year, and I could see the South African putting together a low score in the early going and leaping to the top of the leaderboard before eventually fading away over the course of 72 holes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lowest round:</strong>&nbsp;64 (-7)<br><strong>Winning score:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;270 (-14)<br><strong>Winner's Sunday score:</strong>&nbsp;69 (-2)</p><p><strong>Who will win the Open Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/?ttag=07172025_lk_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship2025\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard and best bets</a>, all from the model that's nailed 15 golf majors, including the past four Masters, and is up over $8,500 since June 2020.</strong></p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Still, they were well-represented at the All-Star Game and rightfully so, as they brought the best record in baseball into the break. This is the first time they've had the top record at the break since 2006. They remain on pace for their best record since that magical season that was 1984.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> just went through their longest losing streak since 2017, but they closed the break with two wins and sit in first by 5 ½ games with the best record in the National League.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> were the hottest team in baseball and had a 3 ½-game lead in the AL East, only to end the first half with losses in three of their last four games -- and those came against the A's and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHW/chicago-white-sox/\">White Sox</a>. Still, they remain in first place and you can't ask much more than that, especially considering they were once eight games out.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>I correctly put the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Houston Astros</a> first in the official Power Rankings last week, but they rewarded me by losing five of six, all at home, heading into the break.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Phillies</a> also lost four of six to finish the first half. The <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> had lost three of four, but closed with two wins. The <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> answered their six-game losing streak with a five-game winning streak, only to drop their last two games.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're counting, that's every first-place team and one second-place team that all struggled, to some extent, late in the first half.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Again, sometimes you just need a little break. So many good teams limped into the All-Star break, but they'll all come back fresh and relaxed on Friday.&nbsp;</p><div><p>\n        Biggest Movers\n    </p><div><p><span></span><span></span><span>\n                5\n            </span><span>\n                Red Sox\n            </span></p><p><span></span><span></span><span>\n                5\n            </span><span>\n                Rays\n            </span></p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><p>Rk</p></th><th><p>Teams</p></th><th>\n                        &nbsp;\n                    </th><th><p>Chg</p></th><th><p>Rcrd</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>\n                                1\n                            </span></td><td><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\" om-event=\"\"><div><figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/306.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure></div><span>\n                                    Tigers\n                                </span></a></td><td>\n                            Was Zach McKinstry the most unlikely All-Star?

And it was <strong>Kyle Schwarber</strong> that delivered the NL's greatest heroics in the swing-off. He drilled all three of his swings over the fence to put his squad in front for good, and in turn, he hauled in the MVP honor after what was an otherwise quiet, 0-for-2 night at the dish. </p><ul><li>Schwarber is the first non-pitcher in MLB history to win the All-Star Game MVP award without posting a hit.</li><li>The <strong>Phillies</strong> claimed their second All-Star Game MVP in franchise history and first since <strong>Johnny Callison</strong> in 1964.</li></ul><p>Schwarber's NL All-Stars led by as many as six runs before the American League stormed back with a four-run seventh inning and two runs in the top of the ninth. <strong>Steven Kwan</strong> legged out an infield RBI single to knot things up at six and invoke the swing-off rule that MLB instituted in 2022. </p><p><strong>Pete Alonso</strong> and <strong>Corbin Carroll</strong> also shined for the NL with a home run apiece, and the former's drove in three runs to, at the time, break things open. On the mound, <strong>Paul Skenes</strong> looked like his usual outstanding self with a dazzling start, fanning a pair of batters in a perfect first inning before giving way to a 12-man committee of relievers. Only<strong> Carlos Estévez</strong> (three) had more strikeouts than the <strong>Pirates</strong> ace. </p>\n        \n\n<h3> 👍 Honorable mentions </h3><ul><li>NBA expansion <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/adam-silver-nba-to-explore-expansion-conduct-in-depth-analysis-in-first-official-step/\">could be on the horizon</a> with the league set to embark on an 'in-depth analysis.'</li><li>The WNBA 3-Point Contest field <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/2025-wnba-all-star-caitlin-clark-sabrina-ionescu-headline-wnba-3-point-contest-participants/\">is set</a> with <em>(possibly???)</em>&nbsp;<strong>Caitlin Clark</strong> and <strong>Sabrina Ionescu</strong> as headliners.</li><li>The <strong>Chargers'</strong> uniform set <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/look-chargers-introduce-two-new-uniform-sets-for-2025-season-dubbed-charger-power-and-super-chargers/\">just got even better</a>, and the <strong>Buccaneers</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-jersey-rankings-which-team-has-most-impressive-collection-of-classic-threads/\">unveiled</a> some of the best throwback threads in the league.</li><li><strong>Portland</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/wnba-expansion-portland-franchise-officially-introduced-as-fire-will-begin-play-in-2026-season/\">unveiled</a> its team name and branding for its inaugural WNBA season.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/which-68-teams-make-our-first-2026-bracketology-and-which-teams-may-be-hoping-for-ncaa-tournament-expansion/\">These 68 college basketball teams</a> are early favorites to make the 2026 NCAA Tournament.</li><li>MLB <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-trying-to-work-out-logistics-for-players-to-participate-in-2028-olympics-in-los-angeles/\">could open the door</a> for its players to participate in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</li><li>After two years away from the league, <strong>Victor Oladipo</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/victor-oladipo-eyeing-a-return-to-the-nba-after-two-years-out-i-know-i-can-help-any-team-in-any-role/\">eyes a return to the NBA</a>.</li><li><strong>Texas</strong> safety <strong>Michael Taaffe</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/texas-safety-michael-taaffe-honors-camp-mystic-flood-victims-at-sec-media-days-with-tribute-tie/\">honored Camp Mystic flood victims</a> with a tribute tie at SEC Media Days.</li><li><strong>Rob Manfred</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/rob-manfred-defends-adding-jacob-misiorowski-to-2025-mlb-all-star-game-roster-it-was-the-right-decision/\">stood by his decision</a> to add <strong>Jacob Misiorowski</strong> to the MLB All-Star Game roster.</li><li><strong>Trevor Lawrence</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jaguars-trevor-lawrence-believes-hes-entering-his-prime-in-fifth-nfl-season-i-need-to-really-turn-it-on/\">says he is entering his prime</a> ahead of a key fifth NFL season.</li></ul><h2> 😡 And not such a good morning for … </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"Washington Commanders v Atlanta Falcons\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/16/337a2b94-67cf-45be-a09a-05f59cef4e8a/resize/670x377/3516c6324789bdacea89fa7e9db48bff/gettyimages-1737389943-1.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"377\" width=\"670\"></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>TERRY McLAURIN</strong> </p><p><strong>Terry McLaurin</strong> wants a contract extension and spent much of the offseason pushing for a long-term deal with the <strong>Commanders</strong>. But as he nears training camp in the final year of his current contract, talks between the sides are at a standstill. McLaurin said the Commanders have not spoken to his camp in over a month, and he is <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commanders-terry-mclaurin-disappointed-and-frustrated-with-contract-situation-as-training-camp-nears/\">\"pretty frustrated\" with the situation</a>. </p><p>\"Everything that has transpired up to this point has been disappointing and frustrating,\" he said. \"I want to continue my career here, I've created my life here, my wife and I have bought our first home here. So this has been somewhere where I've always wanted to be. Just to see how things have played out has been disappointing.\" </p><p>Given that McLaurin is such an integral piece of one of the NFL's most explosive and exciting young offenses, Washington figures to benefit greatly from locking him up on a long-term deal.

He faced Australia 15 times for Great Britain’s rugby league team, winning just four of those matches. Farrell only played in Australia twice for the Lions, captaining the team in Brisbane in 1999 and Sydney in 2002. Both matches were a nightmare, his team humiliated by an aggregate score of 106-16. Farrell’s introduction to the team was more enjoyable. He made the first of his 34 appearances for Great Britain at Headingley against New Zealand in 1993. He was only 18 years old and he scored on his debut. Let’s hope he savoured that moment. His third Great Britain international, in 1994, was an epic.

He was only 18 years old and he scored on his debut. Let’s hope he savoured that moment. His third Great Britain international, in 1994, was an epic. Farrell started in the second row against Australia at Wembley in an arm-wrestle for the ages. This wasn’t a run-of-the-mill Australia side. This was one of the all-time greats.</p><p>The backline consisted of Brett Mullins at full-back, Andrew Ettingshausen and Wendell Sailor on the wings, with Mal Meninga and Steve Renouf inside them. The half-back partnership was Laurie Daley and Alfie Langer, with Ian Roberts in the pack, Brad Fittler at loose forward, and Ricky Stuart off the bench. There were current and future immortals in green and gold that day.</p><p>Midway through the first half, the Great Britain captain Shaun Edwards was sent off. Novice coach Ellery Hanley sacrificed Farrell, substituting him to bring on Bobbie Goulding in Edwards’ place. Great Britain won the match 8-4. It was a masterstroke and a lesson in brutal decision-making for Farrell.</p><p>Surely if Great Britain could beat Australia with a side including mere mortals such as Alan Hunte, Karl Harrison and Allan Bateman, a glorious career of Ashes triumphs and lifting World Cups lay ahead for the young Farell? Nope. Australia would stop him winning every single international tournament in his career: Ashes, World Cup and Tri-Nations.</p><p>As well as Australia, New Zealand and England, Farrell played for the Lions in France, Fiji and Papua New Guinea. He was a loose forward for 16 Tests, in the second row for 15, and even spent the 1997 Ashes series at stand-off alongside Goulding. He was given the captaincy for the 1996 tour and never relinquished it. That trip saw Farrell officially crowned a Lion. For decades, players in both codes had to represent the British Isles in Test matches in the southern hemisphere to be given Lion status. Home matches, or trips to France, did not count, nor did World Cups.</p><figure id=\"0dca6d17-3fc8-4034-b136-0edb290cef57\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96d6261f78125b88530590ea2d1f0fa73409a85/0_0_2041_1537/master/2041.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96d6261f78125b88530590ea2d1f0fa73409a85/0_0_2041_1537/master/2041.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96d6261f78125b88530590ea2d1f0fa73409a85/0_0_2041_1537/master/2041.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96d6261f78125b88530590ea2d1f0fa73409a85/0_0_2041_1537/master/2041.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96d6261f78125b88530590ea2d1f0fa73409a85/0_0_2041_1537/master/2041.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96d6261f78125b88530590ea2d1f0fa73409a85/0_0_2041_1537/master/2041.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Andy Farrell in action for Great Britain against Australia in Huddersfield in 2003.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96d6261f78125b88530590ea2d1f0fa73409a85/0_0_2041_1537/master/2041.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"335.11268985791276\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Andy Farrell in action for Great Britain against Australia in Huddersfield in 2003.</span> Photograph: Darren Walsh/Action Images/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Farrell’s first tour in the southern hemisphere, in 1996, was a woeful one for Great Britain. The team started the tour by scraping through a warm-up match against <a href=\"https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/lions-tour-1996/game-2/papua-new-guinea-vs-great-britain.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Papua New Guinea</a>, winning 32-30; they finished it by losing all three of their tests in New Zealand. Despite the poor results, Farrell showed real leadership and was made captain by coach Phil Larder.</p><p>“As the tour developed, it was obvious he was the leader of the lads,” <a href=\"https://www.lionsrugby.com/en/news/the-making-of-andy-farrell\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">reflected Larder</a>. “Andy wasn’t who I had identified to be captain but he was the one they all looked up to and he was playing exceptionally well. He became my captain. Faz came through as a natural leader, not only on the pitch but outside as well. Everybody in the squad looked up to him. The thing about Andy is he’s got presence. If he walks into a room, he seems to attract people to him. Players latch on to that.”</p><p>A poor run of results in the late 1990s – that chastening trip to New Zealand in 1996, defeats to Australia in the Ashes in 1997 and another series loss to the Kiwis in 1998 – did little for the Lions brand. The Australian Rugby League Commission realised New Zealand were now their closest rivals and decided to host a Tri-Nations tournament in 1999 rather than an Ashes tour.</p><p>The tournament did not go well for the visitors. Farrell must have assumed his Lions experience had hit rock bottom when the team were torn to shreds by Darren Lockyer, Brett Kimmorley, Matthews Gidley, Johns, Fittler, Sailor and co, <a href=\"https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/tri-nations-1999/game-2/australia-vs-great-britain.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">hammered 42-6 by Australia at Lang Park</a>. Just 12,511 fans turned up to watch what they had assumed would be a mismatch. They were right.</p><p>It was another miserable tour, blighted by cliques: groups of players from Leeds, Wigan and St Helens who had spent all season trying to smash each other just could not kiss and make up. Coach Andy Goodway looked on helplessly, his career irreparably damaged by the experience. Farrell will not repeat that mistake with his Lions this year.</p><p>It got worse. Farrell was also a walking punchbag in July 2002 when Great Britain accepted an invitation to face Australia in Sydney for a one-off test in the middle of the season. The Kangaroos, hardened to a flint by Origin, smashed Farrell and his men to pieces. Lote Tuqiri, Lockyer, Willie Mason and Johns had a field day as the Kangaroos romped to <a href=\"https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/australia-vs-great-britain-2002/game-1/australia-vs-great-britain.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">a record 64-10 triumph</a>. It was a never-repeated folly, the type that teaches never-forgotten lessons.</p><p>What looked like the blackest day in British rugby league history was in fact a blip, albeit one that pounded several nails in the league Lions coffin. After that horror show in Sydney, Farrell led the Lions on a heroic run. They lost just five of their next 10 tests against the Kangaroos and Kiwis, remaining competitive in every game. The Lions won three Tests on the bounce to reach the 2004 Tri-Nations final against Australia at Elland Road on a high. Few saw the <a href=\"https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/tri-nations-2004/final/great-britain-vs-australia.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">44-4 humbling</a> coming. Throw in England’s capitulation at the hands of New Zealand in the semi-final of a home World Cup in 2000 and this was one humiliation too far for a proud man. Lions failure must have precipitated his move to union in 2005.</p><p>Whereas his friend Jason Robinson became the 14th and probably last dual-code Lion, Farrell switched to union too late to make their tour in 2005 and he was approaching retirement when the squad set off again in 2009. He added eight England caps in union to his nine in league, but it is a disappointment that such a talismanic giant of turn-of-the-century rugby league should have such a frustrating international record.</p><p>After his debut win, Farrell played in nine series or tournaments for Great Britain (plus two World Cups for England) and failed to win a single one. Of the test series against the Kangaroos and Kiwis, he lost six and drew the other. Yet Farrell was hugely respected and admired by Australian league players, coaches and pundits.</p><figure id=\"bbe1915a-702b-4984-907c-16f107d52495\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20844e5123fb40c075695b0dde89fc6aef72795/0_0_2692_1954/master/2692.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20844e5123fb40c075695b0dde89fc6aef72795/0_0_2692_1954/master/2692.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20844e5123fb40c075695b0dde89fc6aef72795/0_0_2692_1954/master/2692.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20844e5123fb40c075695b0dde89fc6aef72795/0_0_2692_1954/master/2692.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20844e5123fb40c075695b0dde89fc6aef72795/0_0_2692_1954/master/2692.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20844e5123fb40c075695b0dde89fc6aef72795/0_0_2692_1954/master/2692.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Farrell and his team lost 24-12 to Australia in the Tri-Nations tournament in 2004.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20844e5123fb40c075695b0dde89fc6aef72795/0_0_2692_1954/master/2692.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"323.00520059435365\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Farrell and his team lost 24-12 to Australia in the Tri-Nations tournament in 2004.</span> Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>It’s not that he had no success on Australian shores. One of the highlights of his playing career came in Brisbane in 1994, when more than 54,000 fans saw his Wigan team beat the all-conquering Broncos 20-14 to win the World Club title. Three years later the Broncos got their revenge on the same stage, hammering a more prosaic Wigan side 34-0, only a week after Farrell had kicked Wigan to victory over Canterbury Bulldogs at Belmore.</p><p>Unlike the players he started his Lions career alongside – Jonathan Davies, Martin Offiah, Edwards, Garry Schofield, Hanley – Farrell was prevented from playing the off-season in the ARL and never took the plunge in the NRL. So Australian fans never saw him dominate games like he did back home in England.</p><p>Even when things were not going well for his teams, Farrell stood out. I recall a game at Griffin Park in Brentford when London Broncos appeared to be playing against Farrell on his own, his Wigan teammates missing in action as the emergency prop put in a colossal performance. It would prove to be his last league appearance in London before he emerged around the North Circular at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Saracens</a>. By then, Farrell had taken Wigan to another Super League Grand Final but been thrashed at Old Trafford by Leeds. He was dying against rugby league’s light. And a month later at Elland Road, those pesky Kangaroos snuffed it out.</p><p><em><strong>Follow No Helmets Required on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Facebook</a></strong></em></p></div></div>"

Unfortunately, not everyone agrees on the best way to handle it.</p><p>The default setting is to treat the weekend after the break as its own three-day scoring period, but another common approach is to combine it with the first full week after the All-Star break for a 10-day scoring period. I'm providing streamer recommendations for both scenarios here, as always, limiting my selection to those <strong>rostered in less than 80 percent of CBS Sports leagues</strong>.</p>\n        \n\n<p>I have to confess, though, that far more guesswork has gone into his week's streamer selection than most. Rotations have yet to be finalized coming out of the break, and many won't be until close to the lineup lock. I'll try to make updates as necessary.</p><div><p>Sleeper pitchers for short Week 17 (July 18-20)</p></div><div><p>Sleeper pitchers for long Week 17 (July 18-27)</p></div>\n\n\n        \n

What long shots could contend? And how will Royal Portrush play over the next four days? We try to answer some of the biggest question heading into the 153rd Open.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Is Scottie Scheffler still the overwhelming favorite this week?</h2><p><strong>Mark Schlabach: </strong>The Open is the only major championship in which Scheffler hasn't finished in the top three, but links golf hasn't exactly befuddled him. He has four top 25s in as many starts in the event, including a tie for seventh at Royal Troon Golf Club in Scotland last year.</p><p>Links golf would seem to fit the three-time major champion's game perfectly. His world-class iron play shouldn't leave him in too many difficult spots, and on the rare occasion when he does miss the green, his exceptional short game should be able to bail him out. His putting, which was once considered a weakness, has improved dramatically; he ranks 22nd on tour in strokes gained, putting (.362) this season.</p><p>McIlroy, <a data-player-guid=\"f7192f24-1537-e91b-de6f-3548d5989626\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9780/jon-rahm\">Jon Rahm</a> and others are more than capable of lifting the Claret Jug on Sunday, but how can you go against Scheffler at this point? He hasn't finished outside the top 25 in each of his 15 starts on the PGA Tour this season, and he was in the top 10 in each of his past 10.</p><p><strong>Paolo Uggetti:</strong> Yes, but with a caveat. While Scheffler hasn't exactly performed poorly at this major, as Mark pointed out, there is some tension between Scheffler's propensity for fairness on a golf course and the essence of links golf, which can often straddle the line between fair and unfair.</p><p>It appears, however, that Scheffler is trying to embrace that a bit more. It helps, too, that he considers Portrush on the fairer side of links tracks, especially its pot bunkers.</p><p>\"I think some of the links courses I've played, it was kind of hit or miss when you went into a bunker what kind of lie you were going to get,\" Scheffler said. \"There's a lot more slope into the bunkers where the ball kind of funnels into the middle. I would argue that might be a little bit more fair than two guys hitting a similar shot and one guy has to putt it back into the bunker and the other guy has a clean lie.\"</p><p>Yet, as always with Scheffler, it may just come down to his putting. Though he has improved in that area, he is coming off a week at the Scottish Open where he lost nearly a stroke and a half to the field on the greens. That doesn't exactly inspire confidence in his ability to handle another week of links surfaces.</p><p>\"I think getting adjusted to speed is always kind of the most important over here,\" Scheffler said. \"Outside of that, putting is putting. Golf is still golf no matter where you're playing.\"</p><hr><h2>What do you expect from Rory McIlroy this week?</h2><p><strong>Schlabach:</strong> I'd be stunned if it doesn't go much better than the last time we saw McIlroy competing in an Open at Royal Portrush. In the first Open Championship in Northern Ireland in 68 years in 2019, McIlroy seemed overwhelmed by the expectations of being the crowd favorite in his homeland.</p><p>On the first tee, McIlroy pulled his drive left into international out of bounds, leading to a quadruple-bogey 8. He carded a double-bogey 5 on the 16th and triple-bogey 7 on the 18th, adding up to an 8-over 79 in the first round.</p><p>To McIlroy's credit, he rebounded to make seven birdies and one bogey in the second round, nearly rallying to make the cut with a 6-under 65.</p><p>\"You get to an Open, it's a major championship, everything that comes along with it, and I just think that feeling, the walk to the first tee and then that ovation, I was still a little surprised and a little taken aback, like, 'Geez, these people really want me to win,'\" McIlroy said this week.</p><p>\"I think that brought its own sort of pressure and more internally from myself and not really wanting to let people down. I guess it's just something I didn't mentally prepare for that day or that week. But I learned pretty quickly that one of my challenges, especially in a week like this, is controlling myself and controlling that battle.\"</p><p>McIlroy and Ireland's <a data-player-guid=\"81036860-da90-8d9e-be1e-38fdfff557fc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4587/shane-lowry\">Shane Lowry</a>, who captured the Claret Jug in 2019, figure to have the biggest galleries following them again.</p><p>McIlroy's game seems to be in a better place after his post-Masters victory lull; he tied for sixth at the Travelers Championship and for second at the Genesis Scottish Open.</p><p>He certainly has some fond memories of Royal Portrush as well: He set the course record with a 61 as a 16-year-old.</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>For all the talk about how McIlroy might be freed up after his Masters win and what has happened instead, it's ironic and fitting that the place where he has looked perhaps most comfortable and in his element has been here -- in Scotland last week and Northern Ireland this week.</p><p>McIlroy talked Monday about embracing the homecoming he knows he is going to get from local fans instead of isolating himself like he did in 2019. You can already tell he's doing that as he takes time to sign for fans and give them nods and acknowledgments throughout his practice rounds.</p><p>Of course, none of that matters if his game isn't up to par. The good news for McIlroy is that it appears it is. At the Scottish, McIlroy's game looked sharper than it has since the Masters and he seemed content with where things stand heading into the last major of the year.</p><p>\"I'm excited with where my game is. I felt like I showed some really good signs last week,\" McIlroy, who finished second, said. \"I feel like I'm in a good spot and had -- not that last week was a pure preparation week, but I definitely feel like it put me in a good spot heading into here.\"</p><p>At this point, I would be more surprised if McIlroy wasn't in the mix come the weekend than if he was.</p><hr><h2>Thoughts on Xander Schauffele's defense?</h2><p><strong>Schlabach: </strong>It's the last major championship of the year and the final shot at glory, and the reigning Champion Golfer of the Year could use something positive to salvage what has so far been a lost season.</p><p>It's not as if Schauffele has played poorly this season; he hasn't missed a cut in 12 starts on tour and has seven top 25s. His campaign simply feels incomplete after he missed eight weeks with a painful rib injury. His best finishes were a tie for eighth at the Masters and last week's Scottish Open.</p><p>It isn't hard to figure out why Schauffele hasn't won in 2025 after capturing his first two majors at the PGA Championship and The Open last season. He ranks 112th on tour in strokes gained: off the tee (-.018) and 138th in putting (-.144).</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>The more I hear Schauffele talk, the more I think he will win multiple Open Championships, whether it's this week or beyond.</p><p>It seems like he has the ideal approach and attitude toward links golf in that he knows it will be difficult, he knows it will be unpredictable and yet he is relishing the opportunity to grind through anything the course and the conditions throw at him.</p><p>\"It's just the mentality. I think, when you say links golf, it comes with weather, and when you play in bad weather, you have to have a good attitude,\" Schauffele said. \"You have to visualize a lot more than just hitting your number on a machine.\"</p><p>Schauffele hasn't had what I imagine is the follow-up he expected to a dream season last year, but he is clearly trending in the right direction after a T-12 in the U.S. Open and a T-8 at the Scottish last week. If the conditions get unruly this weekend, there are aren't many guys you would trust to excel. Schauffele is one of those.</p><hr><h2>What to know about Royal Portrush and how you expect it to play this week</h2><p><strong>Schlabach: </strong>It's all going to depend on the weather and wind because Royal Portrush is exposed to all of the elements on the northern tip of Northern Ireland.</p><p>That being said, Lowry and the rest of the field enjoyed unbelievable scoring conditions in the first three rounds in 2019. The rain stayed away and the winds were calm, as Lowry carded a bogey-free 63 on Saturday to set a 54-hole scoring record in The Open.</p><p>Then on Sunday, torrential rains and steady winds blew as Lowry and others held on.</p><p>\"We'll see how the weather turns out this week,\" Scheffler said. \"Weather has a pretty dramatic effect on how the golf course is going to play. You can play your practice rounds and prepare, but ultimately when you step on the tee on Thursday, whatever the weather presents is going to be probably the strongest part of the test.\"</p><p>Schauffele noted that the wind can even affect golfers' putts.</p><p>\"Putting is always tricky with wind,\" Schauffele said. \"There's some holes where the mounds cover the greens and some holes that are more exposed where the wind is going to affect the ball on the green. I think whoever wins this week is an extremely well-rounded player.\"</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>It can be gettable (see Lowry's 63 in 2019) and it can also feel impossible depending on the strength of the wind and the direction. Above all, it will require a great amount of strategic decision-making.</p><p>Case in point: During his Monday practice round, I watched McIlroy hit a driver into a 400-yard par 4 and then 3-iron into a 474-yard par 4. I watched him debate with his caddie Harry Diamond for a few minutes about what club to hit off the tricky 15th hole if it played downwind.</p><p>As Scheffler and others have pointed out, Portrush is a links course but it is unique in that there are more elevation changes than at most links courses. This makes for an interesting combination of ground game and air game.</p><p>The players who can figure out when it is right to use one or the other will likely be the ones fighting for the Claret Jug come Sunday.</p><hr><h2>One longer shot that could be in contention this week?</h2><p><strong>Schlabach: </strong>It wasn't long ago that 2022 U.S. Open champion <a data-player-guid=\"a11204a7-ef27-3f00-a28e-358ee5984e77\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9037/matt-fitzpatrick\">Matt Fitzpatrick</a> described his game as \"rubbish,\" and it had been a while since the English golfer had been in the mix at one of the big four until he tied for eighth at the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club in May.</p><p>The 30-year-old doesn't have a great track record in The Open, but he's coming in with good form after tying for eighth at the Rocket Classic and for fourth in the Scottish Open. If the weather gets tricky on the weekend, Fitzpatrick is more than capable of handling the conditions, just like he did at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, when he captured his first major.</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>How about <a data-player-guid=\"25cd1b68-2fd7-49bb-68e9-6abe8d8896ba\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/569/justin-rose\">Justin Rose</a>? Not only did he take McIlroy to a playoff at the Masters, but just last year at Royal Troon, Rose had a real shot to win on the back nine and came up short of Schauffele by only two shots.</p><p>Rose is also coming off an impressive finish at the Scottish Open, where he shot 7-under in the final round to jump all the way up to sixth place. If Rose is able to conjure up one more run at a major this week and end a 33-year drought for Englishmen in the Open it would be an epic story.</p>\n</div></div>"

The former East Tennessee State head golf coach watched as Rory McIlroy, the curly-haired firecracker of a golfer he had first seen at just 13 years old in Ireland, was now trying to hang on to a lead on Augusta National's second nine.</p><p>Birdie. Bogey. Par. Double bogey. Bogey. Birdie. Par. Birdie. Bogey. Playoff. Twenty-one years after Warren nearly got McIlroy to play for him, McIlroy was taking the old coach's emotions for another ride.</p><p>\"He's got a five-shot lead after 10 holes and you think he's going to cruise in,\" Warren said. \"Next thing you know he's making a mess and you're so entrenched in the experience of watching him because he has always been so compelling.\"</p><p>As McIlroy's birdie putt on the playoff hole dropped, Warren's phone started buzzing. Congratulatory texts filled his inbox. A few weeks after McIlroy's Grand Slam victory, Warren couldn't help but laugh as he talked about the frenzy.</p><p>\"I started getting texts from people within a couple minutes saying, 'Your guy just won!'\" Warren said. \"I never even coached him!\"</p><p>For a brief moment in time, a single frame in a multi-decade film, McIlroy was set to move to a small city in Tennessee sandwiched among Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina. McIlroy's short-lived commitment to East Tennessee State is barely a footnote in the ongoing epic of one of the best golfers of his generation. But in Johnson City, this small fragment is not forgotten.</p><p>\"He could have gone wherever he wanted,\" said Aaron O'Callaghan, who had a front-row seat to McIlroy's rise in Northern Ireland. O'Callaghan was one of McIlroy's playing partners on the famous day at Royal Portrush in 2005 -- the site of this year's Open Championship -- when McIlroy shot a course-record 61 at just 16 years old. \"Life came at him fast once he couldn't stop winning.\"</p><p>In recent years, the advent of the transfer portal and name, image and likeness deals in college sports has diluted the meaning of the national letter of intent, which seals an athlete's commitment to an institution. But hanging inside the halls of ETSU's golf performance center in an emerald green frame is a two-page NLI -- a quaint piece of evidence that still holds its weight.</p><p>The date on the letter is Nov. 15, 2004, and though McIlroy's name and all of the cursory information is typed at the top, the signatures at the bottom, one by a 15-year-old McIlroy and the other by his mother, Rosaleen, have yet to fade.</p><hr><p><strong>FRED WARREN WAS</strong> ahead of his time.</p><p>The longtime golf coach for East Tennessee State took the job in 1986 and quickly realized he needed to change his recruiting strategy.</p><p>\"We're a mid-major; we're not a flagship school,\" Warren said. \"I realized with golf being a global game, I could find talent outside of the United States, so I was probably one of the early coaches as far as going overseas.\"</p><p>\"Fred realized that he probably wasn't going to get the best player in Tennessee,\" O'Callaghan said. \"But he felt that if he got the best player in Wales, the best player in Scotland, and the best player -- maybe second-best player -- in Ireland or what have you, then he could be really competitive. And he proved that.\"</p><p>The first Irish player Warren ever recruited to play for the Buccaneers was JP Fitzgerald, who later went on to become McIlroy's caddie from 2008 to 2017. Warren didn't stop there. He continued making his way to different regions of Ireland, Scotland and Wales, establishing a pipeline between the region and East Tennessee State. His work eventually brought about the commitments of players such as Gareth Shaw, who went on to be an All-American at ETSU, and Cian McNamara.</p><p>McNamara and Shaw (as well as O'Callaghan) were part of Ireland's boys teams. So when Warren was recruiting them and traveling to tournaments all over the United Kingdom and Ireland, the name of a younger player kept coming up. \"They're the ones who told me about Rory,\" Warren said. \"I started watching him when he was about 13 or 14. You could tell then he had it, whatever you want to say 'it' is, he had it.\"</p><p>On one of his many trips over to Ireland, Warren found himself watching a 15-year-old McIlroy at Portmarnock Golf Club in Dublin for the 2004 Boys Home Internationals, where he played alongside O'Callaghan and McNamara -- the latter was already set to play for ETSU -- and continued to stand out among older, bigger players.</p><p>\"One thing I noticed Rory had -- and he has that now -- you watch him, and I use the term like starting a bag of potato chips,\" Warren said. \"You think you're going to eat just one or two and then you stay for more. So I would plan to watch him for two or three holes and I'd watch the whole round because he was so exciting.\"</p><p>Even back then, it was already evident to Warren that McIlroy was not going to be long for college golf. But if there was any chance that McIlroy and his family would entertain the thought of playing for just a year or two, Warren knew he had as good a chance as anyone. After all, some of McIlroy's closest friends were already bound for Johnson City.</p><p>That day at Portmarnock, Warren walked with Gerry McIlroy, Rory's dad, around the course. When they made their way to the parking lot, Warren finally made his pitch. This, he thought, was his opportunity to sell the McIlroys on East Tennessee State.</p><p>What Warren didn't realize at the time is that Gerry had already done his homework. The McIlroys had already talked to McNamara and Shaw, their parents too, about Johnson City and why ETSU was the right place for Rory. Still, Warren eased into the topic.</p><p>\"Would Rory be interested in playing college golf?\" Warren asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Gerry said. \"And he'd like to play for you.\"</p><hr><p><strong>IF YOU'RE FROM</strong> Holywood in Northern Ireland where the population barely crests 11,000, Johnson City's 73,000-plus might feel like a culture shock. But the town's quaintness is precisely what made it an easy choice for many junior players abroad looking to hone their games in the States. The scenery helps too.</p><p>\"Johnson City is quite a bit like Ireland in just the terrain, just rolling hills and cattle,\" O'Callaghan said. \"People are very welcoming, and really, they love their golf here, the small-town feel, it's very appealing.\"</p><p>\"It's just not a place where you'd want to go as a top American golfer. But us guys over here, we don't really know college golf,\" Shaw said. \"When you see the tournaments, you see the schedule. And then when I went first, I went out and saw the practice. It was like, 'Oh my god, this is unbelievable.'\"</p><p>Beyond a familiar face in Warren, a practice facility designed by Tom Fazio that was, at the time, rare for a college program, and a stellar schedule, what attracted Irish and Northern Irish players such as Fitzgerald, McNamara and Shaw was also what brought McIlroy to East Tennessee State on an official visit in the fall of 2004.</p><p>\"Being in a bigger city, that would be a big turnoff for guys like myself and Rory,\" O'Callaghan said. \"Here [in East Tennessee] the facility is about a kilometer from where the guys would live.\"</p><p>Warren's biggest recruiting tool was word of mouth among players in the UK, so when McIlroy came to Johnson City, there wasn't much convincing to do.</p><p>\"I think the appeal was going through a place with teammates that he would've known, guys that he enjoyed being around, and could see that it was a place for him to develop his game and take it to professional golf,\" O'Callaghan said. \"It checked all his boxes.\"</p><p>Even though Gerry and Warren had come to a verbal agreement on Rory's commitment at Portmarnock, Warren knew well enough that in recruiting, nothing was certain until pen was put to paper. As Warren tells it, one day, he called the McIlroy household to check in and McIlroy's mother picked up the phone. She told Warren that the head coach at Oklahoma State, Mike Holder, had called their house recently looking to speak with McIlroy.</p><p>\"They have won 12 national championships, and [Holder] is responsible for eight of those,\" Warren said. \"It would be like Coach K calling one of your recruits.\"</p><p>Warren said Rosaleen tried to call McIlroy down from his room to the phone, telling him Holder wanted to speak to him.</p><p>\"She said Rory yelled down, 'Tell him I don't need to talk to him. I'm going to ETSU,'\" Warren said. \"So that was the decision. Then, in November, he signed.\"</p><p>Even as McIlroy turned away other coaches and remained committed to Warren and ETSU, he couldn't avoid what was happening: the more McIlroy played, the more it became evident to everyone, including himself, that he was ready -- not just for college golf but for the pros. It's why O'Callaghan, Warren and Shaw aren't surprised about what McIlroy has become.</p><p>\"He was 4½ years younger than me, so at that stage when I was 18, 19, we were on par so to speak,\" Shaw said. \"He was hitting at the same distance, but he could hit it lower, he could draw it more. He could fade it more. He was a very confident young person.\"</p><p>They all remember the way he hit balls during practice when they first met him at 12 years old and how they sounded different. O'Callaghan remembers the time he couldn't sleep because he, at 15, was set to face off against 12-year-old McIlroy in a match he thought he might lose. The 61 at Portrush that brought out what felt like the whole town to the course is, for them, impossible to forget.</p><p>\"I remember a little bit of it. I don't remember a lot of it,\" McIlroy said this week when asked about that round. \"It was certainly the first time I'd ever felt in the zone.\"</p><p>O'Callaghan remembers one particular moment in 2006, when he witnessed McIlroy stitch together four near-flawless rounds of golf that helped him secure the European Amateur in Italy.</p><p>\"There was a PGA Tour event going on that week [the 2006 Buick Open], and Tiger won by shooting 66 every round,\" O'Callaghan said. \"And I remember us celebrating Rory's win and him seeing Tiger's score and comparing it to his. He was already trying to hunt down Tiger when he was 16.\"</p><p>The writing for ETSU was already on the wall. O'Callaghan and the rest of McIlroy's friends knew he was committed to Warren; they also knew that at that point he was destined for bigger things. Back in Johnson City, Warren also wondered whether McIlroy would actually make his way over. Then, he finally received a call from McIlroy, who, Warren says, had a message for the longtime coach: I'm still coming, but you can give my scholarship to someone else.</p><p>Warren read between the lines and knew then that McIlroy would likely never sport an East Tennessee State uniform. There was disappointment, sure, but also a very clear understanding. McIlroy was a rocket ship.</p><p>\"There were no hard feelings,\" Warren said. \"He was such a kind person, and I understood the situation.\"</p><p>A few days after McIlroy's call, Warren met with one of the school's compliance directors and explained the situation. McIlroy was no longer going to be coming to ETSU. As the director moved to close McIlroy's file, Warren had one final request.</p><p>\"Do me a favor: Don't get rid of that letter,\" he told her. \"I think that young man is going to become No. 1 in the world.\"</p><hr><p><strong>MCILROY NEVER ARRIVED</strong> in Johnson City, but in the history of East Tennessee State golf, he is an essential character. The ripple effects of both his decision to sign there and his decision to not play there linger to this day.</p><p>Back in 2005, Jordan Findlay was prepared to stay another year in Scotland and wait for the right time and place to commit to a school. Then, Warren called.</p><p>The ETSU coach had known that Findlay, winner of the 2004 British Boys Amateur Championship, was interested in making a move to the States, but there was a problem: Warren had no more room for him. But once McIlroy appeared to be on his way to staying abroad and eventually turning pro, Warren reached back out to Findlay and his family. He couldn't give them the full scholarship that McIlroy was set to get, but he could offer a spot on the roster that fall.</p><p>Without knowing much more about Warren and the program than hearsay and never having visited Johnson City, the Findlays turned to a familiar face.</p><p>\"My dad was reasonably friendly with Gerry, Rory's dad, so he actually called him and asked for advice,\" Findlay said. \"We knew Rory had been on a recruiting trip there, so we did it blind and trusted their judgment on it.\"</p><p>The decision proved to be fortuitous. Findlay didn't just end up playing for ETSU, he stayed and still works and lives there to this day. \"I'll give you one guess why,\" he said, before answering his own question. \"I met my wife during my first week here.\"</p><p>The following season after McIlroy's unofficial decommitment, Warren  used the vacant scholarship left behind by McIlroy to help recruit and bring in a player from Ireland: Seamus Power.</p><p>\"You get one guy, and it can lead to a dozen guys. And I think the familiarity of having people from a similar country or same country was attractive,\" Findlay, who grew up in a town of 15,000 in Scotland, said. \"It just became that Scottish people and Irish people knew it was a friendly environment.\"</p><p>\"It was a home away from home,\" Shaw said. It was fitting then that when Warren retired last year, Power knew to whom to turn to replace the Hall of Fame coach. The two-time PGA Tour winner and East Tennessee State alum was on the putting green at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio when he called O'Callaghan to see whether he would be interested in the Buccaneers' head coaching job.</p><p>O'Callaghan never played for Warren (he ended up at Southeastern Louisiana), but he watched as ETSU's reputation grew in his home country and admired Warren's program from afar. The link between him and Power, him and McIlroy and the way all their stories have intertwined their home island with this tiny Tennessee town, made the decision easy.</p><p>\"To be able to lead a program that means so much to your buddies, that people that you grew up with playing with and competed with and played for Ireland with,\" O'Callaghan said. \"It's a huge honor for me.\"</p><p>These days in Johnson City, the connection between the school's golf team and the part of the world that raised McIlroy remains. O'Callaghan has continued the Warren playbook; the current team features six players from all over Europe.</p><p>There's a senior from Denmark, a junior from Germany, a redshirt sophomore from England, a redshirt senior from Scotland and two young freshmen -- Gavin Tiernen from Dublin and Ben Oberholzer, who grew up in Belfast, just a few miles from Holywood.</p><p>\"It's come full circle,\" O'Callaghan said. \"It's very unique.''</p><p>On Monday, McIlroy arrived at Royal Portrush early and played a practice round by himself. As he plotted his way around the golf course he once conquered as a teenager, a robust crowd followed, fans relishing their chance to welcome home their Grand Slam winner. Standing among them, watching every shot intently, was Oberholzer.</p>\n</div></div>"

Yet fewer will recall Faulkner’s improbable triumph during a vastly different era, one without rangefinders and swing analysis, when golfers had to rely on intuition and experience to conquer Portrush.</p><p>“The Open is one tournament you can’t win suddenly from out of the blue: you have to get a taste for it,” wrote Faulkner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/05/guardianobituaries.golf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">who died in 2005 aged 88</a>. He was no stranger to Portrush, having come third in the Irish Open on his 21st birthday at the same venue. To tackle the super-quick greens, described by Faulkner as “the fastest he had ever seen for an Open Championship”, he pivoted to a pencil-slim putter weighing just 11 ounces (312g).</p><p>Before the tournament, three-time Open champion Henry Cotton had snapped a picture of Faulkner, then 34, arms aloft, explaining to American amateur Frank Stranahan and England’s Ken Bousfield how he would win the tournament. They are laughing, for good reason. Two-time defending champion Bobby Locke, who would finish tied-sixth, was undoubtedly the favourite. Cotton and 1947 winner Fred Daly were also among the 98-strong field. Not to mention that Faulkner had admitted to playing “rubbish” golf prior to the event. There was a sense of conviction in his words though. “I’ll show them this time,” he told his wife, Joan.</p><p>A fairly average opening round of 71 on Wednesday meant he started three shots adrift. But when his competitors faltered facing Thursday’s windy conditions, Faulkner stood firm and carded a respectable 70, earning him a two-shot lead. The razor-thin putter had brought results, needing just 27 and 24 putts, respectively.</p><figure id=\"eedf8d5b-ae6b-49ad-bc47-060d73f5a03c\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Max Faulkner plays out of the rough on his way to victory in the 1951 Open at Portrush.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97f232d76e833783831c371184888dd5be35dbe/0_0_3462_2219/master/3462.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"285.2267475447718\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Max Faulkner plays out of the rough on his way to victory in the 1951 Open at Portrush.</span> Photograph: Daily Mail/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>The final 36 holes of the Open were played on the same day that year. He scored another 70 on Friday morning to increase his lead to six, over Argentinian Antonio Cerdá, thanks to a shot described by playing partner Stranahan as “<a href=\"https://www.theopen.com/latest/2019/06/the-greatest-shot-ive-ever-seen\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the greatest shot I’ve ever seen</a>”. After a wayward drive on Babington’s, then the par-four 16th (No 18 today), Faulkner found his ball next to a barbed-wire fence.</p><p>“I thought there was just a chance if I lifted the club up steeply enough to miss the stile, deliberately sliced the shot and lifted the club up immediately after impact to avoid tearing my hands on the barbed wire,” he wrote. Faulkner executed it just like he had imagined, hitting a ridiculous slice with his four-wood which found the green, to save par.</p><p>The afternoon began with a sense of foreboding after he signed the young boy’s ball and felt jitters from the 1st tee. Faulkner, whose lead had been significantly reduced by the time he reached the 18th, recalled: “My knees were a bit shaky as I bent down and I had some trouble getting the ball on the tee.”</p><p>Still, he smoked his final drive down the fairway and a crowd had gathered around his ball. This was a time before tournaments began roping off holes, when besides dealing with the pressure of the moment, golfers had to be mindful not to lose a shoe amid the encroaching spectators.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-11\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>A marker stood over Faulkner’s ball and cleared a space for his crucial approach shot. After pulling out his trusty four-wood, an old friend, Jimmy Adams, hissed loudly at him, trying to tell him he was overclubbing by some distance. There was no hiding behind overzealous marshals, desperately waving ‘quiet please’ paddles back and forth over their heads as if their lives depended on it.</p><p>He shanked his approach, which fortuitously stayed in play after ricocheting off a spectator’s chest, nestling in long grass on a slope. Miraculously, Faulkner found the green with a superb recovery shot and two-putted for bogey. He signed for a 74, but without giant scoreboards to indicate how his competitors were faring, he didn’t know if it was enough.</p><p>It took another hour before a messenger rushed forward with good news. “Tony Cerdá’s taken six. It’s your Open.”</p><p>Faulkner’s 285 total at Portrush, the sixth-worst winning score since 1946, will most certainly not be enough to win there in 2025. But his confidence and fearless approach, on one of the toughest links courses, remain relevant 74 years later.</p></div></div>"

Last month at the NBA Finals, Silver said expansion \"will be on the agenda to take the temperature of the room.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Silver said there was no straw poll taken on the issue or taking sides by owners. He described the tone as one of \"curiosity.\"</p><p>\"A consensus quickly formed that the league office should do the work,\" Silver said, \"and work with these particular committees and the board and present that analysis.\"</p><p>Although that conversation hasn't tangibly moved closer to potentially awarding teams, Silver described the latest update as \"a significant step.\"</p><p>\"We're now engaging in this in-depth analysis, something we weren't prepared to do before,\" Silver said. \"But beyond that, as I said, it's really day one of that analysis. In terms of price, potential timeline -- too early to say. And again, I think that also assumes the outcome of this analysis. It is truly a complicated issue.\"</p><p>Next steps in that analysis, per Silver, include looking at specific markets and investigating the facilities in those markets and the \"appetite\" in those markets. Other factors Silver cited as worthy of study are the long-term effects of splitting leaguewide revenue -- particularly the league's national TV deals -- an additional two ways, which he has compared to selling equity in a business.</p><p>Silver also pointed to the basketball impact of filling two additional rosters and highlighted the uncertainty about the future of local TV deals for teams.</p><p>\"We would be malpracticing if we didn't figure out how local regional television is going to work before expanding,\" Silver said. \"The notion that we would hand over a team into a city where we're not currently operating and say, 'You're going to have to figure out how you're going to distribute your games to your local fans' doesn't make sense.\"</p><p>The NBA last expanded in 2004, when the league added a franchise in <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"377633c2-0dd1-91a1-83c0-9ed2d0c00ea1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets\">Charlotte</a>, North Carolina, after the Hornets moved to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9461f397-7882-94c0-c18c-e89bdc9e570e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans</a>. Before that, the NBA added six teams in a seven-year span from 1988 through 1995. Bringing a franchise back to Seattle to replace the SuperSonics, who moved and became the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bd458c44-2d33-47eb-cebc-35d3d4ac595c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder\">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> in 2008, is a potential outcome of expansion. Silver called Seattle \"an incredible market.\"</p><p>\"I wish, standing here as the commissioner, I had lots of teams to dispense to many markets who are interested in NBA basketball,\" Silver said. \"I just think we also have this greater obligation to expand, if we do so, in a very deliberate fashion in a way that makes sense holistically for the league. That's really the best I can do.\"</p><p>• Asked about the sale of the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a> by the Paul G. Allen estate, initiated in May, Silver said that, \"It is our preference that that team remains in Portland. We've had great success in Portland over the years.\" Notably, Silver said that Portland, \"likely needs a new arena, so that will be part of the challenge for any new ownership group coming in.\"</p><p>The Blazers have played in Moda Center since 1995, making it one of the league's oldest arenas that has not undergone substantial renovations. Moda Center upgrades begun with the aim of completion before hosting the NCAA Division I women's basketball Final Four in 2030, but are on pause during the sale process, per the Rose Garden Report.</p><p>• In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45608949/sources-pistons-malik-beasley-subject-federal-gambling-probe\">a recent federal investigation</a> into former <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4e096981-dc02-51d0-3dcd-2468fcc1e22d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons\">Detroit Pistons</a> guard <a data-player-guid=\"4e963496-bb60-2e6e-6db0-b0b2da819023\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907822/malik-beasley\">Malik Beasley</a> on allegations of gambling related to NBA games and prop bets, Silver said that legalized sports gambling was still preferable to the alternative.</p><p>\"If my choice were legalized sports betting vs. illegal sports betting, I still think a legalized structure is better,\" Silver said. \"What we're seeing now in some of the investigations you're referencing is operational data, which causes in many cases, betting companies or independent agencies who are overseeing this betting activity to raise flags and say what's happening here?</p><p>\"I think the issue is if you didn't have that legalized structure, what would otherwise be going on that went undetected?\"</p><p>Silver did say some of the bets that are offered by sportsbooks are \"problematic\" and that the NBA wishes it had more control over what types of bets can be placed.</p>\n</div></div>"

But college football has long been fueled by emotion, and Manning's background, recruiting hype and the flashes of talent he's shown on the field at Texas have yielded a frenzy.</p><p>Manning's appearance here came with an appreciation for the moment. His grandfather, Archie Manning, played quarterback at Ole Miss, and his Super Bowl champion uncles, Peyton (Tennessee) and Eli (Ole Miss), also starred in the SEC. He grew up in New Orleans going to games at Ole Miss and LSU, and he carries with him a deep appreciation for the history of the conference.</p><p>\"It means everything,\" Manning said. \"I mean, my family has played in SEC, I grew up going to SEC games wanting to be a part of it. So now getting to represent at SEC media day, it's kind of a dream. I know I haven't done anything in the SEC yet, but that's the goal.\"</p><p>Manning's first game as Texas' full-time starter will be at <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/194/ohio-state-buckeyes\">Ohio State</a>, the defending national champion, in Week 1. The Aug. 30 showdown promises to be a rollicking scene for his full reveal to the football world -- high stakes, packed stadium and surrounded by a lot of unknowns on two talented rosters that have dealt with significant turnover.</p><p>\"Any time you get to open with the champs at their place is going to be a hell of a challenge, and I think we're excited for it,\" Manning said. \"They've got a lot of good players, new defense coordinator, Matt Patricia, which will be interesting. So we're excited. It's going to be a fun challenge. Glad I get to get a good one first.\"</p><p>In a small nod to the sensation around Manning, veteran Texas media communications director John Bianco accompanied him to his interviews Tuesday. Normally, Bianco would go with the head coach, but the audible provided a small nod to the need for an experienced traffic cop among the 1,200 credentialed media here.</p><p>Manning appeared nonplussed by the attention, with his demeanor an endearing mix of Southern \"aw shucks\" and quiet confidence. Dealing with attention has been a big part of his life considering his famous football family, and that led in part to him choosing Texas for college.</p><p>\"I think that was the cool thing, kind of why I chose Texas, in part, is because Austin's a big city,\" he said. \"You can kind of go places where no one really knows where you are. I don't know if that was possible in Tuscaloosa or Oxford.\"</p><p>Manning did say that early on in college it proved an adjustment going to class and getting asked for pictures or to sign autographs. Manning quickly found an antidote to that problem.</p><p>\"I usually just call my mom,\" he said. \"A lot of the time I'd be like [uh huh], and she wouldn't be saying anything.\"</p><p>That will be part of life, as nearly a dozen autograph seekers were waiting at the hotel here at media days and sprinted to the SUV when the Texas contingent got out.</p><p>Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian is bullish on Manning, who was a five-star quarterback in the class of 2023 -- ESPN's No. 5 overall prospect -- and backed up <a data-player-guid=\"81693489-80eb-3903-a1c4-67d185a59c36\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4889929/quinn-ewers\">Quinn Ewers</a> the past two years. He pointed out that Manning has \"some swag\" that he's shown in celebrating touchdowns the past two years. He's also excited that Texas' defense is the most talented of any during his tenure, which should ease the pressure of Manning's transition.</p><p>Manning threw nine touchdowns in 10 games last year and rushed for four additional ones. He started games against Louisiana-Monroe and Mississippi State when Ewers was injured and threw four touchdowns in a relief appearance against UTSA.</p><p>Sarkisian also used him intermittently in short yardage situations to exploit his athleticism. Manning joked about his \"welcome to the SEC moment\" coming in the regular season against Georgia when he got \"hawked down\" by Bulldogs star <a data-player-guid=\"046f3cb8-d17d-3fc5-b2b6-82615dadde28\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685597/jalon-walker\">Jalon Walker</a>.</p><p>Sarkisian pointed out that Manning has captured the Texas locker room by being relatable, as he \"makes sense to them.\"</p><p>\"He doesn't think he's more than he is, doesn't walk around pointing at the name on the back of his jersey,\" Sarkisian said. \"He's just an easygoing guy. He's very relatable. He's a good teammate with a really good sense of humor that works extremely hard, and he works extremely hard because he wants to be really good. He's not doing it for anybody else.\"</p><p>The anticipation around Manning is such that there's speculation he could be a high pick in the 2026 NFL draft. That route would be counter to what Peyton and Eli did, as they played out their college careers, in part to fully develop. The early NFL expectation in front offices is that Arch is likely to play two seasons in college.</p><p>Manning politely ducked a question about his future Tuesday, and Sarkisian said he hopes the QB is productive enough to have to make an NFL decision.</p><p>\"I just want the guy to have a really good season this year, and we will cross that bridge when it comes,\" Sarkisian said. \"I hope he has a really hard decision to make because that probably means he played really good.\"</p><p>In retrospect, Manning said he's grateful his two years as a backup allowed him to develop and appreciative that he's remaining in the same system all three seasons.</p><p>He said Tuesday that he's been off all social media for the past two days, the by-product of a friendly bet with a friend. He called it \"healthy,\" as he said he wasn't searching for anything about himself, rather \"just scrolling.\"</p><p>As he prepares to take over as the face of the Texas program, Manning reflected on guidance from his grandfather.</p><p>\"I get a lot of advice,\" he said, \"but I think the one thing that I kind of keep coming back to is my grandfather always tells me to be a good guy and be a good teammate, so I think I'm going to do that.\"</p><p>He then referenced how his father, Cooper, had his career ended as an Ole Miss receiver because of health issues.</p><p>\"Obviously, my dad's career got cut short, so I try to not take anything for granted,\" he said. \"Take the media days, the hard runs, the time in the locker room and time on the team bus and just cherish those moments.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

Christmas starts in July, is four weeks long and comes with a present nearly every single day: That your favorite third-string receiver made a tough snag over the middle in double coverage; that the undersized, small-school undrafted pass rusher is once again terrorizing the backup offensive line; that everybody -- and I mean <i>everybody</i> -- is in the best shape of his life.</p><p>It's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> training camp, folks. And it's right around the corner, with veteran players for the Chargers and Lions reporting to camp later this week, ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44816997/chargers-lions-meet-2025-pro-football-hall-fame-game\">Hall of Fame Game</a> on July 31.</p><p>There's little I look forward to more than the first video to hit my timeline of a few star players jogging out onto the practice field. Perhaps the only thing I cherish more are answers to the following questions, winners of the following positional battles, health for the following injuries and updates on the following rookies.

There is no question about this, none at all. Two of his best acts with the Lions have been as follows: hiring Aaron Glenn as defensive coordinator, and promoting Ben Johnson to offensive coordinator after his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30766148/sources-lions-hire-ex-chargers-coach-anthony-lynn-offensive-coordinator\">first hiring</a> (Anthony Lynn) <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33036043/anthony-lynn-detroit-lions-offensive-coordinator\">didn't work out</a>.</p><p>Those are the only moves Campbell has needed to make at coordinator over his four years in Detroit -- a rare thing for a team as successful as the Lions have been. After years of interest, both Glenn and Johnson have finally taken head coaching jobs elsewhere, which raises a few questions. The first: Just how good is Campbell's eye for coaching talent? New DC Kelvin Sheppard was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43562932/lions-promote-lbs-coach-kelvin-sheppard-dc\">promoted</a> from the linebackers coaching job, but Campbell first worked with him back in 2014-15, when Sheppard was still a player on the Dolphins. He's been the defensive coordinator-in-waiting for a while now. What does Campbell see in him? And will that vision be realized?</p><p>On the offensive side of the ball, where plenty of candidates for internal promotion were available (Hank Fraley, Tanner Engstrand, Antwan Randel El), Campbell went for an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43598107/lions-working-hire-broncos-john-morton-oc-sources-say\">external hire</a> in John Morton. There is some familiarity there, as Morton spent the 2022 season as the Lions' senior offensive assistant. Does he have a particularly strong relationship with <a data-player-guid=\"987f4f39-ed6f-5915-57eb-ec7dc356171c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>, who will need to shoulder a greater load now that Johnson has left the building? Can Morton bring the same creativity, the same situational excellence that powered the Lions' fourth-down approach of seasons past?</p><p>The Lions are transitioning from a rebuilt upstart to a bona fide force, and that means they must combat brain drain. This is Campbell's first crack at replacing key staff departures, and getting it right is critical to completing the total team turnaround.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What does <a data-player-guid=\"7e9fbd60-951e-2d9a-8d8c-b3f1ab6c4a4d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a> do with this (last) chance?</h2><p>When Fields <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39747346/sources-bears-trading-qb-justin-fields-steelers\">finally got out</a> of Chicago last season, I was thrilled for him. Few franchises have been worse at QB development over the past several seasons than the Bears. The Steelers are another such candidate, as they have struggled to modernize their offensive approach or flood their roster with pass catchers for a young quarterback. Of course, Fields joined Pittsburgh as a backup behind <a data-player-guid=\"f0610946-ceb6-9a99-3bcc-cf110b2078b5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>, and he started only six games while Wilson recovered from a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41853236/steelers-russell-wilson-preparing-get-ready-go-vs-jets\">calf injury</a>.</p><p>Rather surprisingly, the Jets gave him a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44194622/jets-reach-2-year-40m-deal-qb-justin-fields-sources-say\">starter's deal</a> and an unimpeded path to the QB1 job. The Jets are another candidate for our \"even worse than the Bears at quarterback development\" list, but it's a new staff in New York -- namely, head coach Aaron Glenn and offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand. Both came from Detroit, and Glenn in particular watched his defenses get ravaged by Fields' legs twice a season. Fields' last three games as a Bear against Glenn's defense: 12 carries for 58 yards and a touchdown; 10 carries for 132 yards; 13 carries for 147 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>Now, the Jets have few pass catchers behind <a data-player-guid=\"da106063-995d-eaf0-54e4-ccecd5e90767\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson\">Garrett Wilson</a>, but they have a pretty solid offensive line. I don't think they'll tip their hand (and put Fields in harm's way) too much during training camp, but I'll be watching the reports closely. And I won't be surprised if we see a 2022-like season for Fields. Back then, he posted 160 carries for 1,143 yards, the second most <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35361863/bears-cite-experience-keeping-justin-fields-lopsided-loss\">all time</a> for a quarterback. If he can replicate that season with his legs, while getting more passing game help from Engstrand and Wilson than he ever got in Chicago, there just might be something there.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/min.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What is <a data-player-guid=\"460fbf74-c64d-3862-b942-852d104e94dd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4433970/jj-mccarthy\">J.J.

I can draw two parallel universes for you. In the first, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45375201/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-justin-jefferson\">a year of rehab</a> gave McCarthy the opportunity to prepare mentally, and he is accordingly as sharp as a tack under center -- no rookie mistakes. Fully <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44919491/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-nfl-draft\">physically recovered</a>, he offers more on the boot than Darnold ever did, creating a new layer in the already dangerous Vikings offense. Minnesota hits the ground <i>running</i>.</p><p>In the other, Minnesota really does hit the ground running because McCarthy isn't ready. He is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44921044/qb-jj-mccarthy-know-ready-start-vikings\">uncertain on the knee</a> and still adjusting to NFL speed, and it's not like he was a pass-heavy maven in college either. The Vikings heavily rely on a retooled offensive line, as well as a running back by committee with <a data-player-guid=\"ca688cbe-b781-01a6-69f2-eb87420aec83\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360569/jordan-mason\">Jordan Mason</a> joining <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042519/aaron-jones-sr\">Aaron Jones</a>.

McCarthy and the Minnesota Vikings.</p></div></div><p>These two worlds, and every world in between, feel possible for the Vikings. We shouldn't overreact to anything we get in training camp, especially negative. The McCarthy we get in August won't be the McCarthy we see in December, as a season's worth of NFL action teaches some big lessons. But the Vikings are in a competitive division and harbor deep playoff aspirations. They only have so much leash to give a rookie, especially when you consider how easily Kevin O'Connell has made veteran quarterbacks shine in this offense. McCarthy's health and confidence are about as big of a July storyline as you get in the NFL.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/cin.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What happens with <a data-player-guid=\"7ab1c7ee-fd75-435d-b0c5-613879216083\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052743/trey-hendrickson\">Trey Hendrickson</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"ee8dca16-7ec4-3fa6-8c10-6cc028cd1802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685562/shemar-stewart\">Shemar Stewart</a>?</h2><p>I remain confident that the two most obvious things will happen in Cincinnati: The Bengals will <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45362772/nfl-bengals-trey-hendrickson-contract-holdout\">reach an extension</a> with Hendrickson that makes him a top-three highest-paid defensive player in football, and they will give Stewart the rookie contract language <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45498593/source-shemar-stewart-leaves-bengals-minicamp-amid-contract-dispute\">he seeks</a> so he can start practicing.</p><p>However, there's a not-insubstantial (excellent writing there; I'm a professional) chance at least one of these takes a left turn. Hendrickson seems to have more internal locker room support for a prolonged holdout than any other player I can remember. Everyone in a Bengals uniform knows he has carried that defense for a long time, and in no season was that more obvious than last year. If Hendrickson flatly rejects every offer the Bengals give him and tries to reinvigorate trade markets as other teams reevaluate their rosters during training camp, I will be surprised. But not shocked.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45500644/nfl-bengals-shemar-stewart-contract-holdout-trade-college\">Stewart situation</a> feels tied to the Hendrickson situation. If Hendrickson is holding out (or holding in, as that's the method these days), then the Bengals will swiftly revert their rookie contract language and get Stewart practicing -- they need him even more than they thought. But what if the Hendrickson deal gets done before camp? I can see the Bengals \"losing\" the Hendrickson negotiation (i.e., paying him a bajillion dollars), and digging their heels in on the Stewart contract as a result.</p><p>Again: I still strongly believe we're going to get the expected outcome on both of these deals, but I'm not counting my chickens just yet.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/hou.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/tb.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>Can Nick Caley get it going? And can Josh Grizzard keep it going?</h2><p>With every offseason, it feels like new offensive coordinators have bigger and bigger leverage in surprising team outcomes. Compare the 2024 Eagles to the 2023 Eagles if you don't believe me -- a playcaller can just as easily tank a humming offense as he can resurrect a fallen one.</p><p>In the latter case this season, we have <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43680408/texans-hiring-rams-nick-caley-new-oc-source-says\">new Texans offensive coordinator</a> Nick Caley, who inherits a Texans offense that fell from lofty expectations in 2024. Houston's approach to pass protection proved far too rudimentary, and opposing defenses easily found pressure schematically. They found it against personnel as well, so the Texans retooled their offensive line accordingly.</p><p>It's easy to poke holes in the 2025 Texans' offensive personnel. Rookie receivers fill the depth chart behind <a data-player-guid=\"338aa0be-bd63-1a24-1929-796af121cefb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4258173/nico-collins\">Nico Collins</a>. <a data-player-guid=\"0c22d637-c0d7-6bac-7333-dc3a992bdc0d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895856/christian-kirk\">Christian Kirk</a> is returning from a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42042587/sources-jaguars-wr-christian-kirk-broken-collarbone\">collarbone injury</a>; <a data-player-guid=\"dd36357c-436b-f059-d957-ddbb12cf33ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4366031/tank-dell\">Tank Dell</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44125809/texans-wr-tank-dell-undergoes-another-surgery-knee\">might not be back</a> this season at all. The offensive line is young and shuffled. But I remember how explosive this offense was in 2023 when the playcalling was sharp, and the core of that success -- <a data-player-guid=\"147e6862-2ac0-3a97-8f36-e3b1c0147320\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432577/cj-stroud\">C.J. Stroud</a> and Collins -- remains. I'm bullish on a Texans offensive bounce-back, so long as Caley is as billed.</p><p>On the other hand, Josh Grizzard isn't looking to rebound, but sustain. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43796736/tampa-bay-buccaneers-offensive-coordinator-josh-grizzard-wizard\">new offensive coordinator</a> in Tampa Bay, Grizzard steps into Liam Coen's shoes as the playcaller for <a data-player-guid=\"5bb4376a-d089-e3e4-e49a-44f1d709a012\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield</a> and a Bucs offense that returns every single starter from last season (and adds <a data-player-guid=\"48fb595b-ecda-3de2-9c05-fcc8090c4b84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567750/emeka-egbuka\">Emeka Egbuka</a>, a first-round wide receiver from Ohio State). But Grizzard has never called plays before, and he was a fast riser through the Dolphins' offensive ranks before his one season as the Buccaneers' passing game coordinator last season. What's his DNA?</p><p>The Bucs were one bounce away from a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401671883\">wild-card win</a> over the Commanders last season, and that was with an injury-riddled defense. If they are healthier on that side of the ball, they look like a bona fide NFC contender ... so long as you assume the offense doesn't take a step back with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43551022/tampa-bay-buccaneers-liam-coen-jacksonville-jaguars-head-coach-happened\">Coen's departure</a>.

Richardson, who has missed 17 games with injuries in his first two seasons, still has the requisite physical talent to not just win the starting job but also become a highly dangerous NFL QB.

The ideal outcome is that Williams suddenly returns to his pre-injury form, though it's worth remarking that even his career-best season (2021, rookie year) was only 4.4 yards per attempt and a 46.3% success rate. But Blue is a speedy change-of-pace back, so steady production from Williams -- an excellent pass catcher -- could be complemented by some big Blue plays.

On paper, he is the most talented wide receiver in New England. But he's 31 years old, coming off an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42074896/texans-wr-stefon-diggs-season-torn-acl\">ACL tear</a> and has already enjoyed some <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45487425/patriots-stefon-diggs-deflects-personal-boat-video-questions\">off-field shenanigans</a> this offseason.

(Technically, tight end <a data-player-guid=\"aa4d3e91-bafe-5ffe-bae4-36e00386dd19\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046439/hunter-henry\">Hunter Henry</a> led the Patriots with 674 yards, but that's rather depressing, and we're only talking about the receiver room right now.)</p><p>Douglas is just OK at slot receiver. Among 27 players who ran at least 60% of their routes from the slot last season, he ranked 17th in yards per route run and 19th in first downs per target. That's not prolific enough to have a stranglehold on that role, and any smart usage of Diggs includes a decent diet of slot routes.

Then, in Week 14, he <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42893482/jerry-jones-demarvion-overshown-right-knee-surgery\">tore the ACL, PCL and MCL</a> in his right knee -- less than two years after an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38229440/source-cowboys-lb-demarvion-overshown-torn-acl\">ACL tear</a> in his left knee robbed him of his rookie season.</p><p>Overshown should be one of two starting linebackers under new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, but when exactly he gets back on the field is something to monitor. He gave a bullish update on his health to the <a href=\"https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/demarvion-overshown-on-injury-rehab-learning-from-matt-eberflus-more\">Cowboys team site</a> in May: \"I think it really couldn't be any better.

Where I'm at in my rehab, in my process, it's where I'm supposed to be plus some.\"</p><p>That sounds rosy, but expect the Cowboys to be cautious with Overshown (as one should be with a player who tore three ligaments in one knee). Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said in April the team does not expect Overshown to start the season, and local reporters have tagged November as a likely window to return. I'd be stunned if we see him do much during camp, but if he really is ahead on his rehab, we could see the rumblings in August of an early return to action.</p><hr><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567962/jermaine-johnson\">Jermaine Johnson</a>, Edge, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"732d3caf-b350-1e34-48c6-b7cebb4a0d88\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a></h2><p>Johnson played his way into the Pro Bowl with a breakout 2023 season, and expectations were sky high for 2024.

But it might not have been in their best interests.</p><p>It was not a pretty evening for <em>Les Blues </em>as Netherlands looked dangerous in the first half, but three goals in six minutes after the break turned things around as Netherlands chased the three-goal win they needed to sneak through to the knockouts.</p><p>If France take a look at the bracket now, though, finishing top might not offer them their best chance of a place in the final. They're now drawn into arguably the tougher side of the knockouts, facing eight-time winners Germany in the quarterfinals, with a semifinal against either hosts Switzerland or world champions Spain to contend with after that ... yikes. -- <em>Emily Keogh</em></p><h3>Wales fans enjoying the spotlight</h3><p>Wales' hopes of progression to the knockout stages had already been dashed by successive defeats to Netherlands and France, but that didn't stop their army of passionate fans from enjoying the build-up to the clash with England in St. Gallen.</p><p>Fans of both teams gathered outside St. Gallen Cathedral in the build-up to kickoff. And, while the England fans launched into a lively chorus of \"Football's Coming Home\", supporters of Rhian Wilkinson's side responded with good-natured taunts of \"You're Going Home.\" -- <em>Beth Lindop</em></p><p>The Wales fans have been a key part of this competition's tapestry. They've travelled in their thousands to watch their team play in their first major tournament, and wherever they've gone, they've brought plenty of passion and song.</p><p>The match itself saw a stirring rendition of \"<em>Yma o Hyd at Kybunpark,</em>\" and once the match begun the Welsh chants of \"Don't Take me Home\" were matched by England's new Sarina Wiegman-inspired chant, where they've adopted The Champs' 1958 song \"Tequila\" to \"Sarina.\"</p><p>Watching on from the stands was Mary Earps, the former England No.1 goalkeeper. She retired on the eve of the tournament and witnessed Hannah Hampton keep her second clean sheet in as many matches. England head through, but the Welsh fans will be missed. -- <em>Hamilton</em></p><h3>Super Swiss</h3><p>Hosts Switzerland had an open training session in Bern on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.blick.ch/sport/fussball/frauen-fussball/frauen-nati/die-news-zur-nati-im-ticker-wieso-traegt-vallotto-beim-einmarsch-eine-kamera-id20977372.html\" target=\"_blank\">and A LOT of fans came out to see them</a>. In fact, there were about 3,000, which is hugely impressive given the event was only announced publicly last night!</p><p>A quarterfinal with world champions Spain awaits, so the fans will want to savor every moment. -- <em>Marsden</em></p><h3>Proud Pantalon</h3><p>Poland's debut at the Euros may have ended this weekend, but it did so with a performance that created history and, as coach Nina Pantalon pointed out, deserved to be celebrated late into the night.</p><p>Pantalon's side were competing in the tournament for the first time ever and registered their first and points in the finals in Saturday's brilliant 3-2 win against 2017 runners-up Denmark.</p><p>\"It's a great feeling,\" Pantalon said. \"We were so looking forward to that final whistle. Those emotions are still with me and will probably stay with me for the rest of my life. After the game, we'll go back to the hotel, have dinner, and then we'll see ...

The players trained on Saturday morning and were then given until Monday off to disconnect ahead of Friday's meeting with the hosts.</p><p>The players took advantage of the time off to get out and explore the picturesque surroundings around their base in Lausanne. There were train rides down Lake Geneva to more remote spots outside the city; some headed to Frience, an outdoor spot known for its natural swimming pools above the village of Leysin; and others even crossed the lake into France.</p><p>\"It's supper important to disconnect,\" forward Salma Paralluelo said. \"We have several days before the quarterfinal and it's a moment to make some plans and enjoy ourselves off the pitch.\"</p><p>When they return to training on Monday, coach Montse Tomé will give them the lowdown on Switzerland. With her coaching staff, she spent the weekend getting to grips with Pia Sundhage's side. \"Just a little,\" she smiled when asked if she was going to allow herself any time off. -- <em>Marsden</em></p><h3>A special birthday</h3><p>There will also be celebrations when Spain get back to work on Monday as Lucia García turns 27. It will be a rare birthday for the Monterrey striker as she gets to be the centre of attention -- which is not usually the case back at home as she is a quadruplet.</p><p>\"I have good memories of birthdays with my three brothers, albeit with very few presents,\" she joked in an interview with ESPN. \"One between us ... maybe one each. But we have shared incredible moments. I don't think many people can say they share their birthday with three siblings!\"</p><p>But does she have anything special planned to mark the occasion?</p><p>\"My teammates will bring out a cake, everyone will sing and I'll say a few words,\" she said. \"I still haven't thought what I will say. A few phrases and that will be that.\" -- <em>Marsden</em></p><hr><h2>Star player of the day</h2><h3>Delphine Cascarino</h3><p>Cascarino set up France's equalizer after they fell 2-1 behind to the Dutch and the San Diego Wave winger then netted a superb strike to put her side ahead. She wasn't done, though, adding a second just two minutes later after Marie-Antoinette Katoto's shot bounced off the post and the rebound fell to the 28-year-old. -- <em>Hamilton</em></p>\n</div></div>"

That's the respect <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> veteran <a data-player-guid=\"981bcb61-629f-464a-9360-5b71c042f6bd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28963/clayton-kershaw\">Clayton Kershaw</a> brings when he steps on the mound, as he did Tuesday -- perhaps for the final time in a Midsummer Classic. Kershaw took the ball in the top of the second inning, earning two outs before manager Dave Roberts pulled him to an appreciative crowd. His last pitch was a called strike three on <a data-player-guid=\"011563f3-5637-9d59-9629-2e6ff3c32b20\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35002/vladimir-guerrero-jr\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr</a>., fitting for the newest member of the 3,000-K club.</p><p>Oh, and, of course, a ball came to Tucker in left field on Kershaw's first pitch of the inning to AL catcher <a data-player-guid=\"6c27dcb5-a741-d526-b5ac-f3988e288a70\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41292/cal-raleigh\">Cal Raleigh</a>. Raleigh sliced one toward the left-field line where Tucker made a sliding catch. It was a sigh of relief for him and the first of two outs for Kershaw, one of the great pitchers of his era. It's almost assuredly the last time we'll see Kershaw in an All-Star Game.</p><p><strong>David Schoenfield: </strong>A younger version of myself, back when I was a kid rooting for the American League to beat the evil National League, would have absolutely loved this game. What a comeback for the AL even if they did end up losing in the end. Down 6-0, the AL showed all the grit and guts of Pete Rose in his prime and rallied to tie the score. Does it matter? No. Was it fun? Sure, even if it doesn't erase my memory of the late, great Dave Parker throwing out Jim Rice and Brian Downing on the bases in the 1979 All-Star Game in Seattle. But somewhere, there is a kid who will remember Rooker's three-run homer or Witt's double down the right-field line or <a data-player-guid=\"ac85b3fc-6fa7-c2c2-d53f-9047b5a3e8f4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41996/steven-kwan\">Steven Kwan</a> hustling down the first-base line to beat out an infield dribbler that tied the score in the ninth inning. Somewhere, maybe a kid fell in love with baseball tonight.</p><p><strong>Jorge Castillo: </strong>Major League Baseball's tribute to the late Hank Aaron alone was worth the price of admission. The lighting, the footage, the narration, the firework representing Aaron's 715th home run to left field ... it was all incredibly well done and touching, with Aaron's wife Billye looking on. Kudos to MLB for putting that together and pulling it off.</p><p><strong>Jeff Passan:</strong> <a data-player-guid=\"0ea828df-ab12-3e43-8900-dee0563e68d4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080761/jacob-misiorowski\">Jacob Misiorowski</a> threw a 98.1 mph slider at the All-Star Game on Tuesday night. Both dugouts filled with laughter at the preposterousness of it. Misiorowski's teammate with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4750d73d-d92e-b390-758c-2c7b44a810db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"f03743f7-bdcd-c6ab-b37d-f52a427827df\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40080/trevor-megill\">Trevor Megill</a>, summed up the pitch with three simple words: \"Oh my god.\" Of all people, he should have understood that the rookie right-hander was capable of such things, but then Misiorowski's capacity to amaze and entertain is boundless.</p><p>The 23-year-old rookie was the unexpected story of All-Star week, the center of attention in a game featuring <a data-player-guid=\"04a76996-4a5c-456d-8022-a9d45e3ff933\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a>. He has started five games and thrown 25.2 innings in the major leagues. No player had ever been named an All-Star with such little experience. And yet Misiorowski's eighth inning -- 18 pitches, nine fastballs over 100 mph with the hardest at 102.3, one hit allowed to Aranda, no runs -- made Skenes' stuff look tame by comparison. Misiorowski didn't just look good. He looked every bit an All-Star.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Relive all the action from the All-Star Game</h2><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Pre-All Star Game predictions</h2><p><strong>Who will win the All-Star Game and by what score?</strong></p><p><strong>Jorge Castillo: </strong>The National League 5-2. The NL has the better lineup and will win the game for just the second time since 2012, when Melky Cabrera won MVP honors in Kansas City.</p><p><strong>Jeff Passan:</strong> The National League will win 3-1. The NL has a far superior lineup to the AL, and in an All-Star Game where pitchers are unlikely to throw more than one inning each, the ability to pile up baserunners seeing a pitcher for the first time is paramount. The NL is more equipped to do that than the AL.</p><hr><p><strong>Who is your All-Star Game MVP pick?</strong></p><p><strong>Jesse Rogers: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"6c27dcb5-a741-d526-b5ac-f3988e288a70\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41292/cal-raleigh\">Cal Raleigh</a>. I mean, he's going to homer ... that's a given. He might even hit two. The \"Big Dumper\" is going to dump a blast into the right-field stands, putting another exclamation mark on an already incredible season. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45743578/cal-raleigh-first-catcher-win-all-star-home-run-derby\">He won the HR Derby</a>, and he'll win All-Star Game MVP.</p><p><strong>Alden Gonzalez:</strong> Pete Crow-Armstrong. He'll have the most productive offensive night among the NL starters and, at some point, make an incredible catch in center field. Crow-Armstrong is 95 games into his age-23 season and has already accumulated 4.9 FanGraphs wins above replacement. He has become a star right before our eyes -- and he seems to love the lights more than most.</p><hr><p><strong>What's the matchup you are most excited to see?</strong></p><p><strong>Rogers:</strong> Let's start the bottom of the first inning off with a bang, as <a data-player-guid=\"2e709af2-d8bb-3d70-978d-f33a50695c14\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42409/tarik-skubal\">Tarik Skubal</a>, the starting pitcher for the AL, will face Shohei Ohtani, who is just 1-for-9 off the left-hander. Does the reigning AL Cy Young winner get an early strikeout of the reigning NL MVP, or does Ohtani finally get to Skubal? Not many matchups are guaranteed in the All-Star Game, but this one is -- and it's about as good as it gets.</p><p><strong>Castillo: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"0ea828df-ab12-3e43-8900-dee0563e68d4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080761/jacob-misiorowski\">Jacob Misiorowski</a> against anybody. The rookie right-hander's inclusion after just five career starts produced a stir across the majors, and all eyes will be on him once he takes the mound. When he does, his 103 mph fastball should certainly play in his one inning. He's as tough of a matchup as any pitcher in this game.</p><hr><p><strong>Who is the one All-Star fans will know much better after Tuesday night's game?</strong></p><p><strong>Gonzalez:</strong> The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a> ended up sending three relievers to the All-Star Game, but there was one clear bullpen representative from the outset: <a data-player-guid=\"104758fd-ec7c-6053-5c76-0d1938b6bdb9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40917/adrian-morejon\">Adrian Morejon</a>. The 26-year-old left-hander doesn't get much notoriety, but he has been utterly dominant, posting a 1.85 ERA and an expected slugging percentage of .263. He doesn't strike hitters out at the absurd rates of some of today's most dominant pitchers, but he gets outs. And he'll probably get three big ones toward the end of the night.</p><p><strong>Passan: </strong>Perhaps they already know Misiorowski because his fastball sits at 100 mph and his slider is in the mid-90s, but this is the sort of showcase built for him. One inning, let it eat and show that even though his career is only five starts deep, this will be the first of many All-Star appearances for the 23-year-old.</p>\n</div></div>"

Not only is he a player in form, but he's also joining a team that's in a state of transition and has a definitive need in the creative department.</p><p>So, how will Tillman fit in Leverkusen?

And are the 2023-24 <a data-league-guid=\"30244926-00c4-3f69-8946-f8421c97ff71\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/GER.1\">Bundesliga</a> champions the best place for one of the USMNT's most gifted creators? ESPN's Constantin Eckner and Cesar Hernandez reflect on Tillman's return to Germany.</p><hr><h2>Wirtz out, Tillman in</h2><p>It's a summer of transition at Leverkusen. Hugely adored manager Xabi Alonso has left for <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"66434654-a8ba-a04c-98e5-6bbd0dbbb780\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a>, with Erik ten Hag arriving to take his place. Star <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"de751eda-c32e-4714-1774-ff1ead8ca19b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=481\">Germany</a> international <a data-player-guid=\"6fb5c533-f861-37b8-8315-0d57da82124f\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/303748/florian-wirtz\">Florian Wirtz</a> left the BayArena in a £100 million (plus £16 million in add-ons) move to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a47fbcec-c948-cf4c-9e41-3dfa37588c9c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=364\">Liverpool</a>, and unsurprisingly given his profile, Tillman has been signed as a central piece of the club's attack.</p><p>Ten Hag spoke to PSV manager Peter Bosz about Leverkusen in recent times, with Bosz having served as Bayer's head coach from late 2018 to spring 2021. The two Dutchmen likely exchanged thoughts on Tillman, too.</p><p>The German-born midfielder was arguably PSV's best player last season. When Tillman was sidelined with an ankle injury in the later stages of the <a data-league-guid=\"e8c15234-75dd-3155-bea5-3a1d9edcfd27\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/NED.1\">Eredivisie</a> season, the Eindhoven club lost 10 points to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f2e03bd4-3ff5-f231-e1d6-4788d035b337\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=139\">Ajax</a> but ultimately overtook its rivals at the end of the season, in part thanks to Tillman.</p><p>Leverkusen have been aware of the midfielder for quite some time, which might not be a revelation given that Tillman is a <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"25b5e432-d3d2-939f-f73b-6e531a6fbd91\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=132\">Bayern Munich</a> academy graduate. He quickly realized there would be little chance to play for Bayern and thus took a different route, first on loan at <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/257/rangers\">Rangers</a> and then for PSV. The Eredivisie side ultimately signed him on a permanent deal for a modest fee of €12 million in 2024. In transferring Tillman to Leverkusen, PSV have nearly tripled their investment.</p><p>The Bundesliga club was aware of the fact that several teams, including some from the <a data-league-guid=\"6949f3af-300c-35f1-beab-b95669eedd38\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1\">Premier League</a>, were seriously looking at Tillman in recent months. That comes as little surprise considering his talent. In particular, Tillman's forceful nature of making runs from midfield and into the penalty area caught Leverkusen's eye.</p><p>Despite being a smaller player, Wirtz exuded a similar degree of explosiveness when running from near the halfway line into the attacking third. Leverkusen don't see Tillman as a one-to-one replacement for Wirtz, though, considering the U.S. international is not the kind of smooth technician who can move effortlessly between the lines and in tight areas. Hence, the <em>Werkself</em> are still looking to add a more technical and possibly smaller attacking midfielder to their squad.</p><p>Tillman has compared himself to <a data-player-guid=\"a7c70b38-08e3-f099-c65d-8427630a2464\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/138860/paul-pogba\">Paul Pogba</a>, another midfielder who is best suited as a No. 8 rather than a No. 10. Nevertheless, Tillman has stressed that his favorite position is the 10.</p><p>\"Well, if someone asks me what my favorite position is, then it is the 10,\" Tillman told German football magazine <a href=\"https://www.kicker.de/tillman-im-interview-dortmund-wird-schon-sehen-was-hier-passiert-996763/artikel\" target=\"_blank\">kicker</a> a year ago. \"Sure, I have also played on the left wing and a bit deeper, because I'm pretty versatile.\"</p><p>Tillman will be an immediate starter for Ten Hag, whose tactical approach is not that far away from Bosz's, although a bit more risk averse. In fact, being Leverkusen's record signing will put considerable expectations on the 23-year-old.</p><p>Despite those expectations, virtually everyone at the <em>Werkself</em> accepts that Tillman won't simply replace Wirtz. Their playing styles are too different, as are their personalities. Wirtz was a natural leader even at the tender age of 19, but Tillman is soft-spoken, introverted and lets his actions on the pitch speak for him. <em>-- Eckner</em></p><h2>A roll of the dice in a World Cup year?</h2><p>Shining at the Gold Cup with three goals and two assists as an attacking midfield conductor, the clever game-changer boasted moments of finesse and flair that helped carry the summer's alternate squad to a second-place finish. By tournament's end, Tillman transitioned from a player about whom you wondered if he could replicate his club form with his country, to arguably a member of the USMNT's best XI.</p><p>With that in mind, it's fair for some American fans to feel a little hesitant about the midfielder suddenly changing scenery less than a year out from the World Cup.</p><p>Can Tillman thrive in the Bundesliga? He most definitely can.</p><p>Culturally speaking, it won't be tough for the German American to return to not only the country of his birth, but also a league he has had some (minimal) experience in. His confidence will be at an all-time high after the Gold Cup, and with the form that he's in, one shouldn't blame the up-and-coming player for having the confident mindset to take on new challenges with a team like Leverkusen.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's a risk.</p><p>There are numerous examples of players who thrived in the Eredivisie but weren't able to perform at the same level in a bigger European league. With the USMNT, it also shouldn't be overlooked how <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9e213fae-5b9d-d331-8b4b-33abdaf57b4f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=203\">Mexico</a> were able to quiet and contain the midfielder during the Gold Cup final that the U.S. lost 2-1. In the group stage against an organized <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a0bc2139-6270-6732-54a7-a49929b07c85\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=655\">Saudi Arabia</a>, Tillman also struggled with making much of an impact in the final third.</p><p>There's a lot to like about the player who clearly has a lofty ceiling, but it'll undoubtedly be a unique challenge for him at the club level for the 2025-26 season, despite not being viewed as a one-to-one replacement for Wirtz. At the moment, the jury is out on whether the coming months will be successfully navigated with Leverkusen and provide an additional boost next summer, or if it'll be a failed gamble on a USMNT player whose stock is at an all-time high. <em>-- Hernandez</em></p>\n</div></div>"

He had some buzz a round or two higher than he went due to his big tools: 65-grade speed, center-field fit at 6-foot-3, 200 pounds, plus raw power and solid-average contact rate in the SEC. He barely played at Clemson before transferring to South Carolina this season, so the track record is short and his swing may need some tweaks, but this is a premium ball of clay with real performance in the best conference.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Brian Curley (No. 92 overall). He may be the first to make the majors in this entire draft class if he's pushed as a reliever, despite some success as a starter later in the season. His four-seamer and slider are both plus pitches while his attitude and amount of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGPjF0lO-_i/?hl=en\">SportsCenter-level reaction</a> on the mound were behind only Liam Doyle this season. The kid is just electric.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: There's a nice group in this class. Kayson Cunningham (No. 18 overall, connected here in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709418/inghespn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709252/2025-mlb-mock-draft-31-kiley-mcdaniel-predictions-final-picks-update\">almost every mock</a>) and Patrick Forbes (No. 29 overall) don't qualify as sleepers and I think everyone who watched college baseball knows Curley.</p><p>Dean Livingston (fourth round) could throw 100 mph soon, but will need to see progress in his command and breaking ball. Sawyer Hawks (sixth round) has unique shapes that let his average stuff play up. Joe Ariola (seventh round) has a 65-grade heater and curveball along with the slider to bridge the gap, but his execution needs refining. Luke Doston (11th round) probably isn't a big league starter, but has unique shapes that I think can work in multiple innings of relief.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: I love the two gambles at the end of the draft: Jacob Parker (19th round; JoJo's brother) might play center field but has 25-homer upside regardless and Ethin Bingaman (20th round) is a real prospect as both a power-hitting right fielder and right-handed pitcher.</p><p>Otherwise, the Snakes targeted stuff/athleticism on the pitching side and contact rate on the position player side, which this braintrust has been doing effectively for years.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/ath.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ath/athletics\"><strong>Athletics</strong></a></h2><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735333\" data-cerebro-id=\"686dcac07bd3d32baee891ac\" data-title=\"The traits that helped make Jamie Arnold a member of the Athletics\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlbdraft_jamiearnold_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735333\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:05</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Jamie Arnold a member of the Athletics</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped Jamie Arnold get drafted by the Athletics.</p></div></div><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Jamie Arnold (No. 11 overall) was probably the best value of the first round as my No. 5 overall prospect after basically losing a number of coin flips at earlier picks. He was my top prospect entering the spring and underperformed a little because of his fastball locations, which seem fixable. He should be a No. 3 or No. 4 starter with some chance to break into the frontline tier.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Zane Taylor (fifth round). He's 23 years old and was a premium senior sign who teams were jockeying to get inside of the top five rounds to set up overpays later. He has three average or better pitches and enough command to continue as a starter.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: I'll give you three guys I'm intrigued to see in pro ball: Devin Taylor (No. 48 overall), Gavin Turley (fourth round) and Grant Richardson (sixth round).</p><p>Taylor was a comp-round talent who shouldn't have made it to the 48th overall pick and may be an above-average hitter for average and power along with an above-average walk rate. Turley is also a left-field fit and has some swing-and-miss to his game, but has 25-homer upside and excellent feel to pull/lift, along the lines of Colby Thomas. Richardson missed the season with arm surgery, but is a 6-foot-3 lefty with a solid fastball and a killer slider. He could move quickly in shorter stints.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The A's did a solid job by stocking up on college performers to deepen the system and selected ones I liked in the first 11 rounds. Arnold and Taylor could be standouts while the others are more role-player types. They added prep lefty Alex Barr (12th round), who is 6-foot-2 and was into the mid-90s at his best, as a potential high-six-figure prep signee if there are savings on the early picks.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/atl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"122673a3-bf06-4432-6950-b8a32e52ac2e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Briggs<strong> </strong>McKenzie (fourth round). He's certainly going to sign for well over slot, with rumors he was looking for $3 million before the draft. He's a solid athlete with a standout, sweeping breaking ball and starter traits.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: There isn't an obvious answer, but it'll probably be whichever of Alex Lodise (No. 60 overall), Dixon Williams (fourth round) and Landon Beidelschies (sixth round) takes one step forward developmentally. If Beidelschies is a relief-only development project, then he's a clear answer.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Conor Essenburg (fifth round). He was seen more as a left-handed starter who was likely going to college entering the spring, then hit really well this spring (including a home run off of a Jack Bauer fastball) and got into the third-to-fifth-round area as a hit-over-power corner outfielder who may be just scratching the surface.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Cody Miller (No. 96 overall) looks like the major piece of savings to set up the pool to pay for McKenzie. Tate Southisene (No. 22 overall) has the tools to be an above-average every-day player if an adjustment to the setup and load of his swing can work, which is doable. He was a favorite of a number of teams that like to stockpile athletic-testing standouts.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bal.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9ca473b8-e73e-a33d-8ea0-b4d160be4be7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Wehiwa Aloy (No. 31 overall) was 15th on my final board, and I know he slipped below that because he both chased and missed in zone at a worse-than-average rate -- but he has also been productive at the plate, has plus power and strong ball flight, and will stick at shortstop after playing in the SEC. Getting either the in-zone miss or the chase up to average would be enough to make him an every-day player, and with the potential to be an All-Star.</p><p>On the broadcast, I pointed out that the Orioles did something like this with <a data-player-guid=\"c255b4c2-f678-3676-9909-d621a9bfc986\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4298641/jordan-westburg\">Jordan Westburg</a>, also an SEC infielder with big tools but limited polish at the plate, at almost the exact same pick.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: There are a few strong candidates here. Ike Irish (No. 19 overall) and Caden Bodine (No. 30 overall) are both polished hitters while Joseph Dzierwa (No. 58 overall) may have the best command in the draft. You can toss out Irish if Baltimore is set on making him a full-time catcher because that will slow down his promotion schedule.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: JT Quinn (No. 69 overall) was one of my favorite college-reliever-to-pro-starter projects this spring and I thought I may be on an island, but he demonstrated why in the Cape Cod League after the season: 3 starts, 14 IP, 13 baserunners, 25 strikeouts. His power sinker/slider/curveball combo are all above average and his delivery/athleticism suggests the strikes could be good enough, even at his 6-foot-6 height.</p><p>Cole Johnson (18th round) is an advanced hitter with average other tools in a corner-outfield fit. Hunter Allen (seventh round) is a 6-foot-4, 245-pound righty with three solid shapes and a mid-90s heater that mean he could last for multiple innings despite coming from D2 Ashland.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The O's used their draft-best bonus pool to mostly add depth to the system from the college ranks, with two contact-oriented, smaller high school position players in Slater de Brun (No. 37 overall) and Jaiden Lo Re (fifth round). As usual, pitchers were not the priority, but I like the upside gamble on Quinn and certainty of Dzierwa, with Caden Hunter (sixth round) having a chance to join them if he adds a tick more stuff.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bos.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6df06f6-785d-3900-4935-5fd13742e2ee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Kyson Witherspoon (No. 15 overall). He seemed ticketed for somewhere between picks Nos. 8 through 12 for half the spring, then seemed to be slipping late in the process as teams prioritized position players and Tyler Bremner and Gage Wood emerged as other collegiate righties.</p><p>Witherspoon's short arm circle is unusual but not as unique as it was a decade ago. On the right day, he'll show a plus four-seam fastball and cutter while keeping hitters off balance with a solid-average curveball and good-enough command. Any progress with his other pitches or command and he'll be a midrotation starter.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Witherspoon or Anthony Eyanson (No. 87 overall) could move quickly but Marcus Phillips (No. 33 overall, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709252/2025-mlb-mock-draft-31-kiley-mcdaniel-predictions-final-picks-update\">nailed in the mock</a>) has a better chance to be left in shorter stints and get to the big leagues first.</p><p>His arm action is a red flag for some teams, but he otherwise has the traits to start, with frontline potential. Does Boston try the risky move of messing with an arm action or let Phillips use his four plus pitches in shorter stints?</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: I'll give you a sampler platter of interesting picks down the board. Christian Foutch (fifth round) has plus-plus velocity that plays down some because of its shape and uses his cutter more than his splitter, but I think the splitter is better. Dylan Brown (eighth round) is a lefty with a 40- or 45-grade heater but average slider and plus changeup; if you can tease out some velo he may be a back-end starter.</p><p>Jacob Mayers (ninth round) was kind of a mess at LSU this year, but racks up strikeouts and has been into the triple digits. Maximus Martin (10th round) has plus raw power and good pull/lift rates along with a solid glove, but he has real contact issues. Patrick Galle (17th round) sits 95-97 and hits 99 mph, adding an above-average cutter and slider, but he threw just 11 innings in two seasons at Ole Miss.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Red Sox added a number of interesting pitchers and I'd expect them to see some immediate arrow-up seasons next year like they did with Brandon Clarke and Payton Tolle this year. Henry Godbout (No. 75 overall, medium tools with good skills) and Mason White (fourth round, big lefty power and infield fit, contact questions) were the two position players with low-end every-day potential. The development-focused Red Sox org seems to zero in on traits to be optimized rather than looking to high schoolers for upside as they did not take a prep player until the 19th round.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/chc.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Josiah Hartshorn<strong> </strong>(sixth round, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">mocked</a> to the Cubs on Friday). He was getting second-round reviews as a long-time standout hitter in the class with a good approach. He is limited to a corner but grew into easy plus raw power this spring.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Kade Snell (fifth round) or Nate Williams (13th round). Snell will be 23 in a few weeks and Williams turns 24 in September. They'll be pushed, but they both performed well in the SEC so they shouldn't last long in A-ball -- particularly Williams since he pitched only in relief and has an above-average four-seam/curveball combo.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Kaleb Wing (fourth round). He was a favorite of a number of analytical teams that are good at pitching development, with the Cubs also in that group. He's a standout athlete with a clean delivery and three pitches with above-average potential, though is only 6-foot-2.</p><p>Colton Book (ninth round) is an lefty with very light velocity but enormous extension (something the Cubs seem to be targeting) and 6-foot-8 lefty Pierce Coppola (seventh round) has had some trouble staying healthy (under 50 innings in four seasons at Florida) but always strikes out a ton of batters, even more than his raw stuff suggests.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Ethan Conrad (No. 17 overall) and Kane Kepley (No. 56 overall) give this class two likely big leaguers with everyday potential and I'll guess Dominick Reid (No. 90 overall; solid-average stuff with strong results) and Snell created some savings to land Wing and Hartshorn.</p><p>I like the combination of getting to the performers and seniors early to get the best of that group to create savings and to actually land top-three-rounds high school players with the savings, not just taking what's left over. There appears to be a real strategy here and one that worked, landing players I think will outperform their draft position -- something that can't be said about that many teams.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/chw.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8f4800c6-3c05-b3d5-8186-9750cd72a3c2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Gabe Davis (fifth round). He was tracking like a late first- or second-round pick entering the spring as a relief-to-starter conversion in his draft year. That didn't happen as he had trouble throwing strikes, connected to his 6-foot-9 frame. He has five average to slightly above pitches and some feel but might fit best in a multi-inning relief role.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Colby Shelton (sixth round). He turns 23 years old in December so he should be pushed aggressively, but he has also been productive offensively and defensively in the SEC for three seasons, hitting 52 homers in 170 games as a lefty-hitting shortstop.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Jaden Fauske (No. 44 overall). He had one of the better summers at the plate on the showcase circuit, has caught some in the past and was turning in above-average run times this spring, a few grades better than last summer. He didn't face much competition in the Illinois prep ranks but has a chance to be a quick-moving, polished high school bat with a shot for plus on-base and plus power output.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Billy Carlson (No. 10 overall), Fauske, and Kyle Lodise (No. 76 overall) are a nice group of position players who were good values at each pick. Landon Hodge (fourth round) is a lottery ticket and Anthony DePino (seventh round) has some of the better tools among college senior signees. I like drafts that have a position-player lean and seek some risk, but also add some likely big leaguers, which is what the White Sox did here.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cin.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"04b65a0b-3cca-d795-0e21-23606470418a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Justin Henschel (seventh round) piqued my curiosity early in the spring before needing elbow surgery after three outings. He flashed three above-average pitches and starter command for the first time but didn't show enough bulk; he could be one of the steals of the draft.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Mason Morris (No. 83 overall). He has a 60- or 65-grade cutter and slurve along with an above-average fastball but might not have good enough command to turn over a lineup, so he could be pushed as a middle-to-late relief type.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Aaron Watson (No. 51 overall) or Eli Pitts (fifth round). Watson might be the best bet in the prep pitcher class (other than Seth Hernandez) to be a real big league starter, giving off some John Lackey vibes. Pitts is a plus-plus runner with good contact skills who just needs to add more power.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Third- or fourth-round talents SS Ethan Moore (18th round) and RHP Myles Upchurch (19th round) could be solid additions if they can be signed. The Reds got a nice mix of prep upside at their first two picks and with Pitts later before moving into the college ranks.</p><p>If Steele Hall (No. 9 overall, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">connected</a> in many of the mocks) turns into a cross between Jett Williams and <a data-player-guid=\"948a03e2-0df4-d2e2-c11d-dbcd7d7b57b8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner\">Trea Turner</a> -- like I think he can -- or even something in that ballpark, this will be a successful class.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cle.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6ad8fa03-36bc-baab-c76a-345b6544424d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-guardians\">Cleveland Guardians</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Jace LaViolette (No. 27 overall). The Guardians tend to gravitate to hit-over-power types in domestic and international amateur markets but leaned hard into big power with Laviolette and Nolan Schubart (No. 101 overall).</p><p>Laviolette entered the year as the odds-on favorite to go No. 1 then had a very uneven spring headlined by a .258 average and 25% strikeout rate.

Dean Curley (No. 64 overall) and Luke Hill (fourth round, called in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">Friday mock</a>) are more Cleveland's usual type.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Ryan Prager (ninth round) or Riley Nelson (fifth round). Prager opted to return to Texas A&amp;M after going in the third round last year as a second-round talent. His stuff and performance both backed up this year, so he's not a slam dunk big leaguer, but he's a lefty with feel and unique angles who could easily be a back-of-the-staff arm.</p><p>Nelson is yet another advanced hitting first baseman along the lines of C.J. Kayfus or Cooper Ingle, both excelling in the Guardians system.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Aaron Walton (No. 66 overall) and Wil Hynes (No. 70 overall) both went a bit higher than I expected, and Nelson Keljo (sixth round) went a bit later than I expected.</p><p>Walton has a power/speed combo with enough contact skills and he might stick in center field at 6-foot-3, 220 pounds. Hynes is a lanky 6-2 prep righty who is polished but might not have a plus pitch. Keljo is a 6-4 lefty with solid-average stuff that was OK as a starter but might fit better in shorter stints.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: There are some intriguing gambles after the 10th round in Vaughn Neckar (20th round, prep righty with a good breaker), Evan Chrest (15th round, sinker/slider righty currently rehabbing elbow surgery), Aaron Savary (13th round, standout size and shapes with below-average velocity), and Ryan DeSanto (12th round, crafty 6-4 lefty who also needs more velo). The last three specifically fit types the Guardians have worked well with in the past.</p><p>If the Laviolette/Walton/Schubart college power bats work out, this will be a good class and also address a big league need.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/col.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f3f1ba71-05f1-a49a-0363-3b1d8e0db4cf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies\">Colorado Rockies</a></strong></h2><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735069\" data-cerebro-id=\"686efa12ac2b6424ea61f30d\" data-title=\"The traits that helped make Ethan Holliday a member of the Rockies\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile%2Fdm_250709_mlb_hollidayprofile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735069\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:10</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Ethan Holliday a member of the Rockies</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped make Ethan Holliday the fourth overall pick by the Rockies.</p></div></div><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Max Belyeu (No. 74 overall). I thought Belyeu would go in the 35-55 range because he looked like a late first-rounder early in the season, then was hurt or playing through an injury the rest of the season. His metrics were just OK this year, but I don't think they reflect who he will be next season and in the future; there's a real shot he's a strong everyday right fielder.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Antoine Jean (seventh round). He might be the first player to make the big leagues from this class because he's probably a long-term reliever, he's left-handed and he performed well this year. Oh, and he'll be 24 in a few weeks.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Ethan Hedges (No. 77 overall). He's a later-blooming athlete who is a real prospect as a reliever but will be developed strictly as a third baseman. He has average-or-so tools but a strong glove and plus arm at third base. Riley Kelly (fourth round) has a curveball that's routinely over 3,000 rpm and continues to make steady progress.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Landing their guy, Ethan Holliday at the No. 4 pick will define this draft, for better or worse. I like the additions of J.B. Middleton (No. 45 overall) and Belyeu after that before getting into the lottery tickets and role players, with Jean as a likely big leaguer to return value while they wait on the rest of the group to develop.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/det.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b27c64bf-4f18-f713-ba06-db1bce2394e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/det/detroit-tigers\">Detroit Tigers</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>River Hamilton (11th round) and Ethan Rogers (18th round). I'll presume Hamilton has a deal done, as most 11th-rounders do, and Rogers might be less likely to sign. Hamilton had third-to-fourth round interest as an athletic righty with above-average stuff, and Rogers' interest was even a touch higher, as a lefty into the mid-90s with an average-to-above four-pitch mix.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Caleb Leys (fourth round). I mentioned Detroit's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">interest</a> in Rogers and Leys in the Friday mock. He could be a quick-mover if he's developed in relief because of his mid-90s heater and being a 22-year-old senior.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Malachi Witherspoon (No. 62 overall). Kyson's twin brother had buzz as high as the late 20s and seemed likely to go inside of No. 50, so landing him at No. 62 is a nice value. He isn't that different from Kyson, though just a tick behind in a couple of respects.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Doubling down on prep hitters who are missing the prime summer showcase events on their résumé is intriguing with Jordan Yost (No. 24 overall) and Michael Oliveto (No. 34 overall) as their top two picks, but also seems like a strategy in light of their interest in Coy James (bad 2024 summer numbers, better 2023 summer performance) whom the Nats drafted.</p><p>Scouting director Mark Conner was the director in San Diego in 2021 when they hit it big with <a data-player-guid=\"eb9b0c5a-cdda-302d-b72c-556c0201c9a9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4872691/jackson-merrill\">Jackson Merrill</a> with a similar lack of high-level summer at-bats, so maybe Detroit has uncovered a way to find value in the most competitive part of the draft?</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/hou.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"00a3015f-09ec-1b03-52af-656f5e0a18d5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Jase Mitchell (seventh round). I <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">connected</a> him to the Astros in my second-to-last mock as they were one of a handful of teams most on Mitchell as his profile rose this spring, with the seventh round being a great value. He's a 6-foot-3, lefty-hitting catcher with a nice mix of hit, power and defense who was tracking as if he might get seven figures.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Nick Potter (fifth round). He threw 29⅔ innings, all in relief, with 17 walks, but with a touch more control the traits are here to be a middle reliever, with a plus fastball and 55-grade slider.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Ethan Frey (No. 95 overall) and Nick Monistere (fourth round). Frey had a quiet college career at LSU then caught fire in the second half, becoming arguably the best hitter for the national champs. He was a designated hitter but has played some outfield and catcher in the past, and his easy plus raw power is real.</p><p>Monistere was a stats find, quietly the third-best prospect for Southern Miss (behind J.B. Middleton and Jake Cook) with 20-25 homer upside as a second baseman. Joey McLaughlin got some late top-five-rounds buzz for his raw tools as a prep outfielder in Oklahoma.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Astros were missing their second-round pick and were picking later in the round throughout, so expectations were a bit lower for their haul.</p><p>Xavier Neyens (No. 21 overall) is a big variance prospect who could be a top-100 prospect in less than a year or run big strikeout rates and be a slower burn. Following that with college performers such as Frey and Monistere was smart, then Mitchell's upside gives some hope of a second prep success story.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/kc.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"11a5df00-0945-35a5-66fe-a3a107975558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-royals\">Kansas City Royals</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Josh Hammond (No. 28 overall).

He ate innings out of the Arkansas bullpen with solid but not overwhelming stuff. He's going to move quickly as a performer with enough raw stuff to get to the big leagues. There's some intriguing pure reliever picks down the board with a shot as well, such as Shane Van Dam (ninth round), Hunter Alberini (11th round) and Matthew Hoskins (12th round).</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Michael Lombardi (No. 61 overall) was a sleeper I kept in my back pocket as the center fielder/closer for Tulane. He gave me some Brody Hopkins vibes because of his two-way college fit and standout traits on the mound that could take off with better development. He made starts down the stretch and got second-round buzz, which is where he ended up going. Lombardi has a mid-90s heater with good shape, an above-average curveball, solid changeup, and could be a starter if he can develop a slider to bridge the fastball/curveball movement gap.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Sean Gamble and Hammond both have clear everyday upside, Lombardi and Justin Lamkin have clear starter potential, and Cameron Millar has impactful stuff that could fit in a couple of roles.</p><p>This draft relies on a couple of those players hitting their upside (I've been heavy on Hammond and Lombardi all spring, a little more mixed but not negative on the other three) because the rest of the draft is likely to have a couple of big league role players, likely righty relievers but maybe some position players as well.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"053868c7-8bff-5edb-3cb6-f5490f33ef99\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>CJ Gray (fifth round). Gray popped onto the scene last summer with a dazzling performance, but scouts tempered their enthusiasm when he had trouble throwing strikes all spring. He finished the season better and showed well at the draft combine, giving teams a glimpse of what his plus athleticism could mean in terms of improvement in the next few years.</p><p>He's a loose 6-foot-2 with a heater into the high-90s, a lower release height and an above-average slider with the makings of a changeup. If he can just keep throwing it over the plate, he has a big league future.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Chase Shores (No. 47 overall, connected in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">my mock 3.0</a>) or Nate Snead (No. 105 overall). If both are left in relief like in college, then Shores will win and could be in the big leagues before the 2026 draft. If Shores is stretched out, Snead has the traits to, with some adjustments, move quickly as well.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Jake Munroe (fourth round) or Luke Lacourse (sixth round). Munroe graded out well defensively at third base and has the polish (pitch selection, ball flight) on top of fringe-to-average tools to be a big leaguer along the lines of Jared Triolo, which is a nice find in the fourth round. Lacourse has the highest breaking ball spin rate in the draft, but was underwhelming with fastball velocity this spring in the low-90s. He could break out with more progress on that front.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: They opted for savings at the No. 2 pick with Tyler Bremner instead of Ethan Holliday or Kade Anderson. Those savings mostly went to prep pitching, with Johnny Slawinski in the third, Gray in the fifth, Lacourse in the sixth and Xavier Mitchell in the 13th all seeming to be overslot -- or at a seven-figure slot in Slawinski's case. It's a bulk strategy contingent on pitching development and I like the confidence to do something different in that spot. Because it's such a high-leverage, public decision, it just needs to work.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/lad.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Aidan West (fourth round). He has some late second-round buzz and I assumed he'd go by the third, but L.A. got him in the fourth. West is a pure lefty hitter with a shot to stick at short along with solid feel to pull/lift the ball. Mason Ligenza -- taken in the sixth round (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">connected in mock 3.0</a>) -- is another likely overslot prep position player, but I'm more convinced that West will hit.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Zach Root (No. 40 overall). He performed in the SEC and has four distinct pitches that are all above average. Root doesn't look like a lot of current big leaguers physically or in his delivery, but lefties come in lots of different packages and I think Root creates deception with his delivery.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: The list is long here. Cam Leiter (No. 65 overall) fits the Dodgers' power arm approach but hasn't thrown many strikes and is coming off of elbow surgery. Landyn Vidourek (No. 104 overall) has huge raw power and showed out in athletic testing at the combine, so the pieces are in place to be a breakout type. Davion Hickson (fifth round) has some starter vibes now, so he's a nice gamble in the fifth. Mason Estrada (seventh round) is probably a reliever, but he was studying to be an engineer at MIT and was up to 97 mph, mixing in a plus breaker, though with a loud delivery and issues with strikes. Jack O'Connor (eighth round) and Logan Lunceford (12th round) could work well in shorter outings.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Charles Davalan (No. 41 overall) might be the best pure hitter in the draft while also having outstanding bat speed -- and might also be a center fielder. He's just 5-foot-9 and didn't play much center in college, so that's why he made it to pick No. 41. I was expecting high-upside, high school fireworks at picks 40 and 41, but the Dodgers saved that for later. Sam Horn (17th round) is a fascinating signability gamble who may need $1 million to sign. He has an above-average sinker/slider combo but limited miles due to elbow surgery and playing QB at Missouri.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mia.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"74909d10-eacb-1376-ef1e-d0f37d7c67ca\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins\">Miami Marlins</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>There wasn't a big gap between talent and pick for any one player in particular, but Cam Cannarella (No. 43 overall) entered the year as a potential top-five pick and battled through a shoulder injury to have an uneven year. If he can get back to his freshman year performance, he'll be a steal.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Joey Volini (sixth round). He'll be 23 in December so he'll likely be promoted aggressively to get him playing with his peers, but he's also a polished performer who had a velo spike this season and may have one more tick</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: You could choose almost any of their picks from Rounds 3-10. Max Williams (No. 78 overall) needs a swing rework/adjustment but has everyday tools. Drew Faurot (fourth round) is a switch hitter with plus power who's a decent defensive second baseman. Chris Arroyo (fifth round) was seen more as a pitcher in high school and has progressed a lot the past two years as a hitter. Emilio Barreras (eighth round) is limited physically, but has some of the best bat-to-ball in the draft. Jake McCutcheon (10th round) has plus raw power from the left side and fits at second base/left field.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Marlins loaded up on college players, in part because these were all solid values at the picks -- but also likely with the thought that the farm system is well stocked in the low minors and the big league team is showing signs of coming together. All of the picks in the top 10 rounds were from bigger schools and were picked within a round, if not a bit later, from where I had them ranked, so the organizational depth has improved a lot today.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mil.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4750d73d-d92e-b390-758c-2c7b44a810db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Daniel Dickinson (sixth round). There was some buzz Dickinson could sneak into the second round, and an assumption he'd go in the third. I'll be interested to see the bonus here, and Dickinson's raw tools aren't immense, but he can hit, is a solid infielder, has good ball flight and played in the best conference.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Andrew Fischer (No. 20 overall). He's a very polished hitter because of his ball flight (pull and lift) and patience, but also has enough bat-to-ball ability and raw power to let it all play. He feels more like a first baseman than a third baseman, but that book isn't closed yet.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Sean Episcope (fifth round) and Joshua Flores (fourth round). Episcope has now had two elbow procedures after blowing out this season, but he leapt onto the scouting stage with sterling showings featuring plus stuff and solid control against top competition. Flores has some trouble throwing strikes but has one of the best breakers in the draft.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Brewers continue to be almost strategy agnostic as a strategy, looking for value and traits wherever they can. They stacked interesting players after the 10th round, adding C.J. Hughes (11th round -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45688041/2025-mlb-draft-rankings-top-250-prospects-final-kade-anderson-liam-doyle-ethan-holliday\">146th on my top 250</a>, connected in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">my mock 3.0</a>, along with Brady Ebel), Cooper Underwood (12th round, my 140th-ranked player), Gavin Lauridsen (13th round, 183rd on my list), and Brendan Brock (14th round, 185th) in Rounds 11-14 from my top 250.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/min.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a6e97b3f-4244-98be-79a2-f4b33f3365e6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/min/minnesota-twins\">Minnesota Twins</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Quentin Young (No. 54 overall). He's the ultimate boom-or-bust prospect in this draft, especially because flame-throwing prep pitcher Jack Bauer wasn't drafted. Young has 40-homer potential and a real shot to stick in the infield -- but comes with the worst contact rate of any prospect from last summer. This is a bet that his athleticism and aptitude can take over and solve that problem, and I'm on board.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: James Ellwanger (No. 88 overall). He could move quickly in shorter stints but probably will be developed as a starter. He had a mediocre fastball shape early this spring that steadily got better and now pairs well with his plus breaking stuff for a potential midrotation starter.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Matt Barr (fifth round). The 6-foot-6 junior college righty was into the high-90s with huge spin rates and multiple above-average breaking balls but not a ton of polish. He could take off in the next few years if his command/execution can progress. Kolten Smith (12th round) entered the year as a second-round talent at Georgia and had a poor season, with injuries and lesser velocity, but still has a plus breaker and solid traits.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: Marek Houston (No. 16 overall) was a solid, though not inspiring, first pick but then the Twins took some swings on less polished players with bigger ceilings such as Riley Quick (No. 36 overall), Young, Ellwanger, Jason Reitz (No. 88 overall), and Barr.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nym.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Cam Tilly (seventh round). He pitched largely in relief at Auburn but has an above-average sweeper and splitter to go with an average heater and a starter-looking delivery, so he might become a long-term starter with some improvement in execution.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Peyton Prescott (fifth round). He was up to 98 mph with an above-to-plus slider and splitter, but his numbers didn't match the huge raw stuff. Maybe the Mets try to stretch him out as a starter, but there's a shorter path to success in relief.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Anthony Frobose (ninth round). He's a young-for-the-class, later-blooming, two-way player with big power and a glove that has a shot to fit at shortstop along with a plus arm who has been into the mid-90s on the mound. I <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">called their interest</a> in Wyatt Vincent (11th round) in my Friday mock, and he has standout athleticism.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: This draft wasn't heavy on players who are \"famous\" or highly ranked on media rankings, but there are some clear trends, such as projectable high schoolers with a standout ability or two, or even Antonio Jimenez (No. 102 overall), a college player who fits that idea with big power and a steady glove at shortstop but with questions about how much he'll hit.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/nyy.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2b9cedf3-ce60-0bcf-fafe-8cd055255685\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Rory Fox (sixth round). He's a former shortstop who flashed above-average stuff and a starter profile on the mound this spring, but his stuff tailed off a bit down the stretch. There were times when he looked like a second- or third-round talent and he might look like that as soon as next season.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Pico Kohn (fourth round). He'll be 23 years old in October, so he'll be moved quickly. He dominated the SEC with a fastball/slider combo and his velo was up this season, but I think the Yankees might help him develop a changeup that could make him a potential big league starter.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Richie Bonomolo Jr. (seventh round) He's a plus-plus runner and plus defender in center field who has good enough on-base skills and raw power but also above-average ball flight. It's an intriguing mix of tools for a player who I thought should go in the fourth round but lasted until the seventh.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Yankees are up to their usual tricks, getting a solid value at the top in Dax Kilby (No. 39 overall, called in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709252/2025-mlb-mock-draft-31-kiley-mcdaniel-predictions-final-picks-update\">my Sunday mock</a>), targeting advanced hitters and pitchers who aren't yet optimized.</p><p>They've found some success doing that with a pitcher from Texas Tech (Chase Hampton) and took another Red Raider in Mac Heuer (eighth round), who some thought was a seven-figure talent out of high school. Blake Gillespie (ninth round) was a big college performer with medium stuff who also could benefit from the Yankees' pitching development program.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/phi.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Gage Wood (No. 26 overall). I know there's reliever risk with this pick and some non-surgical shoulder issues in Wood's past, but he could be an impact big league arm as soon as September and he shouldn't have been on the board at No. 26. We know that the Phils are willing to pay for a late-season relief upgrade, so it's worth even more to them than other teams.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Wood is an easy one, but Cade Obermueller (No. 63 overall) could also be pushed as a fastball/slider lefty with fringy command who will be 22 years old in a few weeks. Gabe Craig (fifth round) is another reliever who could move quickly with some tweaks.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Sean Youngerman (fourth round) and Cody Bowker (No. 100 overall). Both are college starters who were seen as relief types at points in their amateur career but continued evolving. Will Vierling (11th round) was the best prospect on the Cinderella Murray State club that went to Omaha and is a cousin of former Phillie <a data-player-guid=\"93179bd5-a6ad-5ba4-c584-bb8ef99867b5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41636/matt-vierling\">Matt Vierling</a>.

Matthew Fisher is a fringe first-round talent (seventh round, connected in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">multiple mocks</a>) whom I'm assuming the Phils can sign. I'm guessing there are five big league arms in this group.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/pit.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Seth Hernandez (No. 6 overall). It seems hard to get a standout value at the No. 6 pick, especially with the most derided demographic in the draft in prep righties, but I've been fully behind Hernandez throughout the spring straight through his predraft interview on our broadcast Sunday. His pro career might just be a different version of what Hunter Greene has done.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Easton Carmichael (No. 82 overall). He's a well-rounded potential everyday catcher who has made a lot of progress the past few years, but I could also see Murf Gray (No. 73 overall) slugging his way through the minors</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Gustavo Melendez (fourth round). He's listed at 5-foot-8, 160 pounds but has sneaky pop, can really pick it at shortstop and makes a surprising amount of contact against good velocity for the effort in his swing. Dylan Palmer (11th round) is a plus-plus runner some teams really liked. Connor Hamilton (14th round) has great fastball/sweeper/athleticism traits but had an uneven spring. Carter Gwost (17th round) was a late-rising athletic-testing standout with tools.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Pirates continue to believe in high school players at high picks, which is more rare than you think, and they did a nice job getting depth for the system with solid players at solid values throughout the top 10 rounds.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sd.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Ty Harvey (fifth round). He's a plus athletic-tester with plus raw power and has improved as a defensive catcher to the point that I think he'll stick there. He's older for the class and you can imagine contact being an issue, but I think he'll be a power-over-hit catching prospect with a big league future.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Kruz Schoolcraft (No. 25 overall). Usually a prep pitcher isn't the best option for this category, but many of San Diego's college picks are lesser tools/bench types or projects with big tools. If the Padres can get Schoolcraft's breaking ball to be consistently average, he'll shoot through the minors.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Michael Salina (fourth round). He has been over 100 mph with some effort from a high slot but blew out this spring when scouts were expecting to see him showing more feel in longer stints. He's an intriguing prospect. Ryan Wideman (No. 99 overall) has big tools but a worrying chase rate.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: It looks as if the Padres plowed their bonus money into the top four picks then went for savings after that, so Schoolcraft, Wideman, Salina, and Harvey will need to carry the class, though Kerrington Cross and Will Koger are a little better than just money savers.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sf.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e072b79c-4fa1-3a55-bdcd-4d7d9734d79b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-giants\">San Francisco Giants</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Reid Worley (ninth round). He's a little older for the class and a skinny 6-foot-2 with low-90s velocity, but he's a great value because of his killer breaking ball with 3,000 rpm and multiple shapes. His lower slot helps his fastball shape a bit, so another tick or two of velocity could turn Worley into a high-level prospect.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Gavin Kilen (No. 13 overall). He's a polished lefty hitter who raked in the SEC and can play any infield position. He was picked here because his floor is a good utility player who will move quickly through the minors.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Trevor Cohen (No. 85 overall) and Cam Maldonado (seventh round). Cohen might need a swing adjustment/reworking but has everyday level tools, and Maldonado is another above-average athlete with a power/speed combo who might work as an everyday center fielder.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: It's a college-heavy group with mostly hit-first types with enough athleticism to play up the middle, then the savings from the Giants' early strategy were applied to Worley -- who has one of the highest floors among this year's prep arms because of that breaking ball.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sea.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"56d60582-088f-6848-5180-1fb04440cf87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a></strong></h2><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735038\" data-cerebro-id=\"686dfae6ea1499368b3987e3\" data-title=\"The traits that helped make Kade Anderson a Mariner\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0709%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson%2Fdm_250709_mlb_kadeanderson.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735038\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Kade Anderson a Mariner</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped make Kade Anderson the third overall pick by the Mariners.</p></div></div><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Korbyn Dickerson. He was a later second- to third-round talent as a center fielder with 25-homer upside but a shorter track record and some contact concerns. There's some risk, but he's a nice gamble in the fifth round.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Lucas Kelly (sixth round). He has been up to 99 mph with a four-seamer from a sidearm slot that he mixes with a solid slurve. Kelly could probably reach the upper minors pretty quickly as a potential seventh-inning type.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Jackson Steensma (ninth round). Not every team had him in a position to be drafted because he sat out the college season because of elbow surgery, but he has a starter profile with solid-average stuff and good feel.</p><p>Mason Peters (fourth round) is a lefty with one of the best curveballs in the draft. Isaac Lyon (10th round) throws 90-91 mph as a lower slot righty but backs it up with a plus sweeper, solid changeup and lots of strikes. Griffin Steig (18th round) and Casey Hintz (16th round) are two more low-slot types, as is potential overpay Cam Appenzeller (19th round).</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Mariners got the No. 1 guy on my board with the No. 3 pick, then added solid values from there -- a potential everyday catcher, another prep shortstop with top 100 tools, multiple interesting pitchers for different roles. It's another solid class with some of the historical trends that have worked for the Mariners in recent drafts.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/stl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a></strong></h2><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735080\" data-cerebro-id=\"686dca3dd5fb3860ccc891a4\" data-title=\"The traits that helped make Liam Doyle a member of the Cardinals\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0708%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile%2Fdm_250708_mlb_liamdoyle_profile.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735080\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:55</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The traits that helped make Liam Doyle a member of the Cardinals</p><p>Kiley McDaniel explains the traits that helped make Liam Doyle the fifth overall pick by the Cardinals.</p></div></div><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Cade Crossland (fourth round) or Ethan Young (fifth round). Crossland has an above-average curveball and changeup along with an average fastball/slider and wasn't fully optimized at Oklahoma. I thought he should've gone early in the third round and he might have more velo coming; he'd hit 98 mph at times, but not that often.</p><p>Young is a personal favorite from the college reliever-to-pro starter bucket who has all the traits to make it work.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Liam Doyle (No. 5 overall). He could be up there tomorrow, but the Cards haven't taken a lot of pitchers like him in the past, so I'm not sure how they'll handle him. His teammate Tanner Franklin is likely to be developed as a starter, too, but could move quickly as a reliever.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Tanner Franklin (No. 72 overall) or Ryan Mitchell (No. 55). Franklin might turn into a midrotation starter if it all clicks in the conversion. Mitchell has a standout hit tool, is an above-average runner with patience and good ball flight, but the concerns are if he's a second baseman long term and that he has below average power. I like to bet on players like this figuring out those problems.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The first draft with the influence of incoming president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom looks a little similar to some past drafts (Mitchell, Crossland, Young, Matt Miura, Payton Graham, Ryan Weingartner all feel like guys they would've taken before Bloom arrived) but Doyle at the top (stuff over command, starter/relief question) was a different type and you could argue the same with Franklin. I like the evolution, for the record.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tb.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f8a579c6-08b9-7584-141d-317d0645763b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value: </strong>Brendan Summerhill (No. 42 overall). There were predraft rumors that he would slide because of some of his erratic play -- like how his exit velos dropped three whole grades this year from last year -- making a player with strong tools and solid performances feel like more of a developmental type than usual.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Aidan Haugh (sixth round). He doesn't have huge stuff but really performed as a senior at North Carolina and I'd bet he will be in the upper minors in short order.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Taitn Gray (No. 86 overall). He has plus-plus raw power, is young for the class and is a standout athletic tester with a chance to be a long-term catcher. His hit tool is a mystery, but there's a lot to work with here. <a data-player-guid=\"ae2e73d0-1806-cd2d-73a0-71a4e20cc4aa\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31749/luke-jackson\">Luke Jackson</a> (11th round) is an interesting development project with limited miles on his arm.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: The Rays continue moving along doing what they do, targeting upside prep position players with tools and a collection of college sleeper types as complements. Cooper Flemming (No. 53 overall) was a hot name entering the draft due in large part to a great swing, and Dean Moss (No. 67 overall -- Moss and Gray <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">both called</a> in the Friday mock) was a favorite of scouts with great feel, and James Quinn-Irons (fifth round) was a late-emerging college player with huge tools.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tex.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4fa2cf46-09fc-255f-74a1-2a8857b0e671\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Gavin Fien (No. 12 overall). My three pound-the-table prospects for this draft were Eli Willits, Fien and Josh Hammond, so Fien is going to be a good value almost anywhere he's taken -- even if he was taken around where I had him ranked. I think he's an above-average hitter for average and power who will stick at third base.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: AJ Russell (No. 52 overall) or Ben Abeldt (fifth round). Russell has had some stops and starts because of injuries but has a plus-plus fastball with great shape that could help him move quickly to the big leagues. Abeldt sat out 2025 because of elbow surgery, but before that had the look of a lefty reliever who would rush to the big leagues.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Josh Owens (No. 84 overall). He wasn't a big name at the beginning of the spring but slowly gained steam throughout the season with a projectable frame along with above-average speed and power projection, leading to some comp-to-second-round speculation. I <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709226/2025-mlb-mock-draft-30-kiley-mcdaniel-predicts-top-picks\">connected</a> Owens and the Rangers in my Friday mock.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: I'll guess Owens and Fien get the two biggest bonuses of this group. Beyond them, there are several college prospects who add depth to the system, with likely relievers near the top of the group. Paxton Kling (seventh round), Jacob Johnson (11th round) and Mason McConnaughey (fourth round) are some other intriguing names from the college picks.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tor.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0151aed9-9f11-ceae-195d-180ca603b64a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Tim Piasentin (fifth round). The Jays like drafting Canadian high schoolers, and Piasentin was the best position player in that class this year. He can really hit and has plus power, but defensively fits at one of the four corners. I had him in the third round, most had him as a third- or fourth-round talent, so I'd guess he is a bit over slot in the fifth.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Jake Cook (No. 81 overall). I went into some depth on him <a href=\"https://x.com/espnpodcasts/status/1943400522880319682\">on the BBTN podcast</a>, but here's the elevator pitch: He's a 22-year-old converted pitcher who just started hitting regularly this season, made a ton of contact and, at 6-foot-3, he's the fastest player in the draft bordering on <a data-player-guid=\"6f7b531f-6eba-302e-9fdc-4696c7544adf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4679983/chandler-simpson\">Chandler Simpson</a>-level speed. He's also a plus defender in center field and has a plus arm that was up to 96 mph on the mound. Cook doesn't really know how to steal bases or lift the ball yet, so he's raw, but he also could fix the base-stealing part of that very quickly.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: I love a lot of the players the Jays took. Eric Snow (sixth round) produced solid offensive metrics, Dylan Watts might be a long-term starter in the seventh round, Karson Ligon (ninth round) is one of the better senior arms in this draft class and Jared Spencer (11th round) looked like a second-rounder before shoulder surgery. But he could move quickly once healthy.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: I was a big JoJo Parker guy as the spring wore on: Parker (No. 8 overall) has a great mix of hit tool, performance and average-or-so other tools with excellent makeup reports. Blaine Bullard (12th round) and Ty Peeples (20th round) are both big potential payoffs after the 10th round. It sounds as if they'll both require seven figures to sign, but I have them as both worth it, if Toronto can get the money. Bullard, in particular, is a plus-plus runner with plus athletic-testing grades and projection to his frame; he's on campus at Texas A&amp;M.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/wsh.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals\">Washington Nationals</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Best value</strong>: Landon Harmon (No. 80 overall). Down the stretch, Harmon was getting comp-to-second-round overpay projections, and the Nats landed him in the third.</p><p>He's typical in some ways, a prep righty up to 98 mph with loud stuff and an aggressive delivery that he needs to harness, but his four-seam/sweeper shapes and athletic testing are among the best in the class. I connected the Nats and Harmon in my <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45709252/2025-mlb-mock-draft-31-kiley-mcdaniel-predictions-final-picks-update\">final mock</a>.</p><p><strong>Quickest to the big leagues</strong>: Ethan Petry (No. 49 overall). There are a lot of decent candidates but no polished reliever to plug in here. Petry has three years of SEC performance, so he should breeze through Single-A. Being a right-handed, corner fit who could end up at first base means there isn't a massive upside, but he's a slam-dunk big leaguer who should move pretty quickly.</p><p><strong>Sleeper to watch</strong>: Miguel Sime Jr. (fourth round). I was so-so on Sime after the summer and early in the spring, as he seemed to be a 6-foot-4 velo sideshow without much more to offer. Down the stretch and in the MLB Draft League, he looked like a different player, flashing an above-average curveball and changeup while throwing strikes. He's a potential midrotation type if he continues progressing.</p><p>Of the later picks, I like Boston Smith (sixth round) as a high probability senior sign, Jack Moroknek (11th round) and Jacob Walsh (15th round) for their huge power and Tucker Biven (13th round) as a potential long-term starter.</p><p><strong>One big thought</strong>: I was the high guy in the industry on Willits and ranked him No. 3 in my top 250, on the same tier with Kade Anderson and Ethan Holliday. But I was still hesitant to see who the Nats landed with the savings to justify taking a (slightly) lesser talent at the top pick.</p><p>Landing Harmon, Sime, Coy James (fifth round), and possibly Mason Pike (19th round) is a really strong outcome to where the move at the top is now justifiable.</p><p>I think the Nats did an above-average job with their other key picks, collecting a nice group of senior signs and six figure lottery tickets.</p>\n</div></div>"

He reclassified to the 2025 class, so is one of the younger players in the draft, not turning 18 until December, a big plus in analytic draft models. He's a clear shortstop with a good hit tool and contact ability, with his future power outcome the biggest question mark as he turns pro.</p><p><strong>Why the Nationals took him here: </strong>There was a lot of intrigue about which direction the Nationals would go in a draft without a slam-dunk No. 1 pick -- and Washington surprised everyone with this pick. Willits was one of the top players in this draft, but he was behind Ethan Holliday and Kade Anderson as options to go No. 1 overall. He's one of the youngest prospects in this draft -- and that's a very good thing for his potential, considering <a data-player-guid=\"62868d49-9586-ee9d-19b4-66fb91f26733\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32653/carlos-correa\">Carlos Correa</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"94848feb-9141-9679-d2cd-ae79905d969c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32129/francisco-lindor\">Francisco Lindor</a> were also both 17-year-old shortstops on draft night.</p><p>There's also a chance that taking Willits here could come with some bonus-money savings that sets Washington up for some splashy picks in the coming rounds. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong>Kevin McGonigle, with more speed and defense</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>2. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"053868c7-8bff-5edb-3cb6-f5490f33ef99\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a>: Tyler Bremner, RHP, UC Santa Barbara</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 18</p><p><strong>Who is Bremner?</strong> Bremner entered the season alongside Jamie Arnold as the top collegiate pitcher after a strong sophomore season and a summer pitching for USA Baseball's collegiate national team, but he scuffled early on with inconsistent stuff and results.

Like his brother, Ethan is a left-handed hitter, although he's much bigger (6-foot-4 compared to 6-foot) and built more like their dad, thus projects to have similar 30-homer power. He lacks the range to stay at shortstop but should be an above-average defender at third base. There are some concerns about his performance last summer on the showcase circuit and weak competition this spring in high school, but scouts love the swing and power ceiling.</p><p><strong>Why the Rockies took him here:</strong> There was plenty of talk about Holliday being a possibility for the No. 1 pick, so the Rockies have to be happy about getting the player who might have the best chance of developing into a true major league star. His best-case scenario is reaching the majors as a power-hitting, good-fielding third baseman who turns into the Rockies' first franchise player since they traded away a power-hitting, good-fielding third baseman in Nolan Arenado. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> Left-handed-hitting version of <a data-player-guid=\"2eb5e599-5517-7cf4-8f12-de7e6bd899f3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33857/matt-chapman\">Matt Chapman</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"1a1ec65f-a81f-8ce9-9f38-7275b93a2474\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez\">Eugenio Suarez</a></p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/stl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>5. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a>: Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 6</p><p><strong>Who is Doyle? </strong>One of the three highly rated lefty collegiate pitchers, Doyle went 10-4 with a 3.20 ERA for the Vols, striking out 164 in 95⅔ innings, finishing second in Division I in strikeouts and first in K's per nine.

Arnold's fastball is a class below some other recent top pitching prospects though, and that could limit him to be more of a mid-rotation starter than a future ace. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong>A bit of <a data-player-guid=\"340816fb-4469-8d43-2e6c-738329c31ed4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30948/chris-sale\">Chris Sale</a> and a bit of <a data-player-guid=\"4e3529e7-ab6a-3a42-a59b-e3c04345ba31\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42433/nick-lodolo\">Nick Lodolo</a>, if Arnold's command progresses</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/tex.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>12. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4fa2cf46-09fc-255f-74a1-2a8857b0e671\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a>: Gavin Fien, 3B, Great Oak HS (Calif.)</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 12</p><p><strong>Who is Fien? </strong>Fien was one of the top prep hitters on the summer showcase circuit in 2024, but the 6-3 right-handed hitter struggled at times this spring during his regular high school season, not producing the same hard contact as consistently even though he was facing weaker competition.

While we've spent a lot of time talking about polish and safe bets among the college pitching prospects taken tonight, Schoolcraft is on the opposite end of the spectrum as a 6-8 high schooler who can touch the high 90s with his fastball -- but he still has plenty of development work ahead of him. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"8a57ca6c-4738-321a-a2aa-54eb43e2d96b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42359/cristopher-sanchez\">Cristopher Sanchez</a>, if it all clicks</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/phi.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>26. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a>: Gage Wood, RHP, Arkansas</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 16</p><p><strong>Who is Wood? </strong>After pitching primarily in relief his first two seasons with the Razorbacks, Wood moved into the rotation but came down with a shoulder impingement early on and missed two months, returning to finish with 37 innings across 10 starts. His final start was one to remember, however: a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/45525762/2025-mens-college-world-series-arkansas-gage-wood-no-hitter-historic\">no-hitter against Murray State in the College World Series</a> with a CWS-record 19 strikeouts (just the third no-hitter in CWS history and first since 1960). He has one of the best fastballs in the draft, sitting 95 but reaching 98, with excellent carry that induces a ton of chase. He adds a hammer curveball to give him one of the best pitch combos in the draft. There is clear reliever risk here given the health history, but he'll be given a chance to start.</p><p><strong>Why the Phillies took him here: </strong>Wood has a chance to be one of the steals of the draft in going this late in the first round. Yes, his track record in college is limited, but the two-pitch mix is elite. Indeed, given some of the struggles of the Phillies' bullpen and Wood's limited innings this spring in college, it's not out of the question that he's rushed to the majors this season as a reliever and then developed next year as a starter. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> Usage/outcomes could look like Lance McCullers, though Wood is more fastball-oriented</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cle.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>27. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6ad8fa03-36bc-baab-c76a-345b6544424d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-guardians\">Cleveland Guardians</a>: Jace LaViolette, CF, Texas A&amp;M</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking:</strong> No. 21</p><p><strong>Who is LaViolette? </strong>LaViolette had some 1-1 chatter at the beginning of the season after hitting 29 home runs as a sophomore, but his numbers dropped way off as he hit .258 with 18 home runs, his strikeout rate remaining a problem at over 25%. Still, he's a 6-6 lefty slugger with plus-plus raw power and a plus runner who might be able to stick in center field (or be a plus defender in right). He makes quality swing decisions and has a quick bat, but swings and misses a lot in the zone.</p><p><strong>Why the Guardians took him here: </strong>This is a very un-Guardians-like pick, but Cleveland has also been in desperate need of power-hitting outfielders and that is exactly what LaViolette is -- as long as he can make enough contact to get to his tremendous power. The Guardians are getting a player at No. 27 who was in the conversation to go about 26 spots earlier than this before the college baseball season began. If they can get the best out of the long-limbed Texas A&amp;M slugger, this could be one of the steals of this draft. At the same time, there is definitely a fair share of risk here. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"33de8a2e-6a24-ed47-a5ea-e31b6a1d03df\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33912/cody-bellinger\">Cody Bellinger</a>, if he moves his swing in that direction</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Prospect Promotion Incentive picks</h2><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/kc.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>28.

He sits in the mid-90s but has been up to triple digits, getting swing and miss with explosive life at the top of the zone. He has a wipeout slider, but the lack of a consistent third pitch, plus some injury history and control issues, suggests he could end up in the bullpen.</p><p><strong>Why the D-backs took him here: </strong>After taking a high school hitter with their first pick, the Diamondbacks turn around and go college starter here. A former two-way player, Forbes has taken off during his time at Louisville and still has plenty of room for growth. He has thrown just over a 100 innings during his college career, so he's much more raw than most college aces, but his explosive fastball and athleticism could help him find another level on the mound as a pro. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bal.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>30.

He had nearly twice as many walks (47) as strikeouts (24) this spring, with some of the best contact rates in the country, but he hit just five home runs. He can catch and his arm is good enough, so it's a question of whether he can impact the baseball enough as a pro.</p><p><strong>Why the Orioles took him here: </strong>Hmm, are the Orioles down on <a data-player-guid=\"ef72b3ad-2cb6-eecb-37ab-24726859d3c5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42178/adley-rutschman\">Adley Rutschman</a>? Or is this a potential hedge against Rutschman's potential departure down the road as a free agent?

He was the SEC Player of the Year after hitting .350 with 21 home runs, showing strong exit velocity metrics and, while not a burner on the bases, the range and athleticism to remain at shortstop. He had twice as many strikeouts as walks, whiffing over 20% of the time, so the contact and chase issues will have to improve.</p><p><strong>Why the Orioles took him here: </strong>The reigning SEC player of the year at the No. 31 pick? It might be better to ask \"Why didn't anyone else take Aloy in the 30 picks before this?\" And it comes down to his tendency to produce more swing-and-miss than you'd like to see from a college prospect. But, as we said when the Orioles took fellow SEC standout Ike Irish earlier tonight, they have a history of getting a lot out of this type of hitter -- and they're leaning into college bats so far. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> <a data-player-guid=\"5b0dc2c1-e790-cc40-0add-4ce6867ac25b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33675/willy-adames\">Willy Adames</a> -- a real shortstop defender with plus power but some contact concerns</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/mil.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>32.

Mission accomplished.</p><p>The 18-year-old forward launched at least 20 shots in both of his summer league appearances, something he did only twice in 37 games during his lone season at Duke.</p><p>\"I'm exhausted,\" Flagg said after his 31-point performance in Saturday's loss to the Spurs. \"I'm not used to bringing the ball up like that, and every time I'm getting the ball full court, I had somebody on my hip playing 94 feet. So, definitely not used to that, but I think I did a solid job of bringing it up against pressure and trying to set up our different actions.\"</p><p>Although Flagg had a poor shooting effort in the opener, going 5-of-21 from the floor, the Mavs were pleased with his two outings. He consistently made good reads and created open looks for teammates, despite finishing with just five assists. He committed only three turnovers overall and appeared to get more comfortable against ball pressure in real time. Case in point against the Spurs: The last two possessions of the third quarter, when Flagg escaped <a data-player-guid=\"bf077b0c-98d4-3009-bb34-a07e5a64f4d2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5061568/carter-bryant\">Carter Bryant</a>'s pressure in the backcourt and attacked for an and-1 layup then drove down the lane for a dunk out of a half-court set.</p><p>\"Incredible for a kid who we're saying, 'We're going to give you the basketball and they're going to pick you up full court,'\" Mavs summer league coach Josh Broghamer said. \"Everyone has 10 fouls, so there is no penalty for grabbing and holding. The referees can't call everything on every play, so it's even more exhausting and tougher on him than a regular game.\" -- <em>Tim MacMahon</em></p><hr><h2>Harper debuts vs. Flagg</h2><p>After missing the Spurs' run in the California Classic and their Las Vegas opener due to a minor groin injury, No. 2 pick Dylan Harper returned just in time to face Flagg in Saturday's anticipated matchup. Limited to 20 minutes, Harper still showed plenty of the skills that made him the consensus second-best prospect after Flagg.</p><p>Perhaps Harper's most impressive highlight came on defense, as he raced back in transition to swat <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4433629/ryan-nembhard\">Ryan Nembhard</a>'s transition layup, getting well off the court to protect the rim. On offense, Harper's ability to draw contact stood out. He went 6-of-7 at the foul line, including finishing through a Flagg foul for a three-point play.</p><p>The biggest question mark about Harper remains his shooting, as he missed all four of his 3-point attempts. How quickly he improves will determine how soon he joins the San Antonio veterans (who were sitting courtside Saturday) as a starter. --<em> Kevin Pelton</em></p><hr><h2>Bulls' Essengue will be a project</h2><p>When the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\">Chicago Bulls</a> selected <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5242496/noa-essengue\">Noa Essengue</a> at No.12, they readily acknowledged how the 18-year-old from France -- the second-youngest player in the draft -- was not coming into the league as a finished product. But Essengue's first appearance of the summer on Friday showed just how raw of a talent he truly is.</p><p>He scored five points in 25 minutes, dribbled the ball off his foot, knocked the ball into the rim while trying to grab a rebound and acknowledged after the game he was surprised by the level of physicality.</p><p>Essengue was better and more comfortable in his second game on Saturday, and the Bulls staff was happy with the way he responded. But Chicago doesn't expect Essengue to be a key part of its rotation entering the season, and it's unclear if he'll be much of a contributor at all during the 2025-26 campaign. -- <em>Jamal Collier </em></p><hr><h2>Impressive early flashes from Kings' Clifford</h2><p>Going into the draft, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4702384/nique-clifford\">Nique Clifford</a> was labeled a plug-and-play Swiss Army-knife-type wing who can have a positive impact with his feel for the game, his perimeter shooting and his defensive versatility.</p><p>Clifford has looked the part through two games while accumulating 36 points, 16 rebounds, and 8 assists over 54 minutes in a pair of Kings wins.</p><p>The hope in drafting the 23-year-old player is that he'll be ready to contribute from day one. He has demonstrated his ability on and off the ball. He attacks the rim aggressively out of pick-and-rolls and in the open court. And he does the little things he built up a reputation for: going out of his area for rebounds, guarding multiple positions from point guard to power forward, fighting over screens and making simple plays to find teammates for open looks.</p><p>As the first draft pick made by the new <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e266c4ea-9af3-1bd8-06fb-fd608fd30e26\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings\">Sacramento Kings</a> front office led by Scott Perry and B.J. Armstrong, Clifford likely will have every chance to prove he's ready to step into a role early in his NBA career. Nothing he has shown in summer league so far suggests otherwise, especially if the Kings can clear out some of their logjam on the wing. --<em> Jonathan Givony</em></p><hr><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45720296,whitelist-AU|AR|CF|BJ|FM|AM|MZ|TT|BS|VG|SC|BF|LS|NG|SL|AG|EC|LR|NA|MU|MW|CR|MX|SX|GM|GP|GW|BR|NI|BB|GN|NE|GY|UG|GD|SV|ZM|SN|US|AS|GU|MP|PR|VI|UM|GB|UK|CL|PY|ST|CO|GQ|KE|MH|MQ|NZ|VC|AW|TC|CU|CV|MF|BO|BM|CM|KM|BQ|PW|PA|ZW|SR|JM|UY|PE|AI|BZ|BW|MG|CI|SS|GT|TZ|FJ|CG|BI|GA|GF|MS|VE|TG|GH|LC|ER|RW|ET|ML|AO|SZ|HT|CD|KY|ZA|RE|KN|DO|HN|\" data-cerebro-id=\"6871b764f9cb241c51c482e0\" data-title=\"McNeeley, Hornets take down Jazz in first summer league game\" data-source=\"espn\" data-contributing-partner=\"wsc\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0712%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0712%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0712%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45720296\">play</span><figcaption><p>2:04</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>McNeeley, Hornets take down Jazz in first summer league game</p><p>Liam McNeeley and the Hornets come out with a win in their first summer league game over the Jazz.</p></div></div><h2>Notable rookie performances</h2><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/cha.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong><a data-player-guid=\"6d6b4455-4c69-3296-96e1-e20ed80ec16f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5239590/liam-mcneeley\">Liam McNeeley</a> | Forward | <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"377633c2-0dd1-91a1-83c0-9ed2d0c00ea1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets\">Charlotte Hornets</a></strong></p><p>McNeeley scored 22 points with 12 rebounds off the bench in his summer league debut on Friday against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77cea2fb-1388-b7c8-d171-2e72b3aecbfb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/utah/utah-jazz\">Utah Jazz</a>, showing a promising two-way skill set over 28 minutes.

He looked like a different player in Las Vegas, dropping 24 points on 12 shots -- including 5-for-9 from 3 -- in 28 minutes while making the adjustments you hoped to see with his decision-making and assertiveness.</p><p>Jakucionis' pace, feel and skills were evident as he used -- and rejected -- ball screens in getting to spots on the floor, created opportunities for big men rolling to the rim or shooters in the corners, and scored in the lane using his size, strength and craft.</p><p>He showed no hesitation drifting into catch-and-shoot 3s but also hit a tough pull-up 3 in transition and an isolation step-back jumper, demonstrating impressive confidence. At 6-foot-6 with a quick release and the ability to get his jump shot off against strong contests, his capacity to operate without the ball adds valuable lineup versatility for Miami's coaching staff as his shot creation continues to develop against bigger, longer athletes. His defense likely will play a major part in exactly what kind of role he'll be able to carve out as a rookie, but there was a lot to be encouraged by in his opening performance in Vegas. -- <em>Givony</em></p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/orl.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong><a data-player-guid=\"299c942c-0435-341d-b08e-19d226d035c7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5214637/noah-penda\">Noah Penda</a> | Forward | <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"74c23102-8c27-c8e6-ec1b-8a8fd4d42554\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic</a> </strong></p><p>The Magic traded up to No. 32 early on Day 2 of the draft to take Penda, who averaged 10.2 point per game in France at age 20.

Beringer needs a lot of seasoning after starting to play basketball only four years ago, but he has tremendous physical gifts at 6-foot-11 with a 7-foot-5 wingspan and fluid movement. He has the potential to be an impactful rim-running, rim-protecting center and can develop as the understudy to fellow Frenchman and four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year <a data-player-guid=\"78795dbf-3e02-934e-f796-d6a71375c9f5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032976/rudy-gobert\">Rudy Gobert</a>. -- <em>MacMahon</em></p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/sas.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong><a data-player-guid=\"bf077b0c-98d4-3009-bb34-a07e5a64f4d2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5061568/carter-bryant\">Carter Bryant</a> | Forward | <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8aef8547-32f5-0943-a1de-e734567674cc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs\">San Antonio Spurs</a></strong></p><p>Tasked with defending Flagg, Bryant showed his potential on that end Saturday. On a notable early possession, he prevented Flagg from getting separation then hounded him into a turnover. Later, multiple efforts by Bryant on the perimeter helped force a Dallas shot clock violation. Bryant hasn't shot well this summer (3-for-22 overall on 3s), but his physical perimeter defense can get the No. 14 pick on the court as he develops offensively. --<em> Pelton</em></p><hr><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45698676,whitelist-CL|SX|FJ|PY|KY|PA|HT|AW|PW|AM|BO|GY|LC|SV|MP|AI|MG|CR|VG|ML|GB|UK|GH|MW|RW|ET|BZ|GP|PR|BS|BI|NA|AS|MQ|CD|SN|BF|CG|SL|AO|VI|SC|TZ|LS|GF|PE|JM|BQ|UY|NI|CI|CU|RE|ST|UM|AR|TG|BW|MU|MS|EC|AU|KE|GT|US|GU|ZM|TC|MX|NG|VE|ZA|KN|ZW|CM|SZ|BJ|GD|NE|CO|MZ|NZ|MH|CF|GA|ER|BB|BR|SR|AG|GQ|HN|GN|MF|CV|VC|UG|KM|GW|LR|FM|GM|SS|BM|TT|DO|\" data-cerebro-id=\"686ddc90d5fb3860ccc8944e\" data-title=\"David Jones-Garcia nails a 3-pointer for San Antonio\" data-source=\"espn\" data-contributing-partner=\"wsc\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0709%2Fcf74d9d4%2Db855%2D4208%2Da0c4%2D4d22426e7cf8%2Fcf74d9d4%2Db855%2D4208%2Da0c4%2D4d22426e7cf8.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0709%2Fcf74d9d4%2Db855%2D4208%2Da0c4%2D4d22426e7cf8%2Fcf74d9d4%2Db855%2D4208%2Da0c4%2D4d22426e7cf8.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0709%2Fcf74d9d4%2Db855%2D4208%2Da0c4%2D4d22426e7cf8%2Fcf74d9d4%2Db855%2D4208%2Da0c4%2D4d22426e7cf8.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45698676\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:18</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>David Jones-Garcia nails a 3-pointer for San Antonio</p><p>David Jones-Garcia pulls up from downtown and drains a 3-pointer for the Spurs.</p></div></div><h2>Other key storylines from summer league</h2><p><strong>Spurs' Jones-Garcia 'belongs on an NBA court'</strong></p><p>Harper calls <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/4713010/david-jones-garcia\">David Jones-Garcia</a> \"a bucket,\" while Spurs assistant Mike Noyes has said on multiple occasions this summer that the 23-year-old forward \"belongs on an NBA court.\" Before landing in Las Vegas, the undrafted Jones-Garcia made the All-California Classic summer league team after averaging 22.7 points over three games while going 8-for-17 from 3.

On the TV coverage, reporters have been asking the riders how they spent the rest day. Both Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogačar say they had haircuts. Pogačar seemed very pleased that he’d had a ride with a proper cafe stop as well. Bill has emailed in with his thoughts on today’s stage: Given the profile of the parcours, I can’t see any breakaway thrilling heroics ending well, as the day sets in for the bunch sprint. I’m genuinely pleased that Healy is in yellow, he got a proper stomp on on Monday, and seems to be in a position to keep hold of the jersey today. If he keeps his wits about him, it’s only his Toulouse.  Continue reading...",

Success in the “Baby Giro” in Italy drew him to the attention of the American team, <strong>EF Education-EasyPost</strong>.</p><p>More than his results, Healy’s approach to racing, free of the risk-averse tactics of some predecessors, is refreshing and exciting. Unafraid to fail, his attacking style has sometimes fallen short, with a <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/13/giro-ditalia-ben-healy-lands-solo-stage-win-while-evenepoel-loses-time\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">stage win in the 2023 Giro d’Italia</a></strong> the notable exception.</p><p>In this Tour, however, with victory in Vire and a yellow jersey just four days later, he has finally fulfilled his promise. His success has been Ineos Grenadiers’ loss, as he is understood to have rejected an opportunity to move to the British team.</p><p>For <strong>Oscar Onley</strong>, currently seventh overall, his second Tour has been a world apart from his debut, in 2024, when he finished 39th. The 22-year-old from Kelso admitted that he was overwhelmed on his first appearance in the race. “I really struggled during the first week,” he recalled. “I was wondering: ‘What am I doing here?’”</p><p>This year, Onley is seventh overall as the race looks towards the <strong>Pyrenees</strong>. So far, he has coped much better, holding on to a high overall placing through one of the toughest and fastest opening weeks in Tour history. “Once you’re racing, it’s just another bike race,” he said, “but it’s the scale of everything around it, the expectations, the media.”</p><figure id=\"ba13da6a-85ad-4713-a5aa-9527f6b4ad1e\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:7,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Onley and Blackmore lead the charge of young Britons at Tour de France&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;ba13da6a-85ad-4713-a5aa-9527f6b4ad1e&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;inline&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/15/onley-and-blackmore-lead-charge-young-brits-on-tour-de-france&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:11,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure></article><article id=\"block-6877905b8f088603e1f61893\"><header></header><p>The viewers of TNT Sports have voted on who they think will win today’s stage.

This could be the last full bunch sprint of the Tour, so let’s plump for Philipsen; if the break goes and the sprinters’ teams tire in the finale the wily Dane Magnus Cort is a good bet.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The preview was written before the Tour, so <strong>Jasper Philipsen </strong>(<strong>Alpecin-Deceuninck</strong>) won’t be in the mix today after having to withdaw from the race on stage three.</p></article><article id=\"block-687634358f0860b26c41b534\"><header><h2>Preamble</h2></header><p>After a rest day on Tuesday, the Tour riders are back for stage 11: a <strong>156.8km loop</strong>, starting and ending in <strong>Toulouse</strong>. It’s classified as a flat stage with <strong>1,750m of elevation gain</strong>, but there are a few bumps for the peloton to navigate: <strong>four category four climbs</strong> and <strong>a category three climb</strong> at the end.</p><p>Sprinters such as, <strong>Jonathan Milan</strong> (<strong>Lidl-Trek</strong>), <strong>Tim Merlier</strong> <strong>(Soudal-Quick-Step</strong>) and <strong>Biniam Girmay</strong> (<strong>Intermarché-Wanty</strong>) will be eyeing up this stage, which could very well end in a bunch sprint. However, <strong>Mathieu van der Poel</strong> (<strong>Alpecin-Deceuninck</strong>) has speed and strength that could come in handy for a flat stage with some lumps. It’ll also be interesting to see what Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) does, wearing the yellow jersey that he grabbed off <strong>Tadej Pogačar’s</strong> (<strong>UAE Team Emirates XRG) </strong>shoulders on stage 10. As always, I’d love to get your thoughts, so please email via the link above.</p><p>Before the action starts at <strong>1.15pm CEST (12.15pm BST)</strong>, here’s a reminder of how stage 10 played out:</p><figure id=\"19bdd552-d1e0-40ab-8f2f-92280f9f1d60\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Tour de France 2025: Ben Healy rides into yellow as Simon Yates storms to stage 10 win&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;19bdd552-d1e0-40ab-8f2f-92280f9f1d60&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;inline&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/14/tour-de-france-2025-ben-healy-rides-into-yellow-as-simon-yates-storms-to-stage-10-win&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:11,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure></article><gu-island name=\"LiveBlogEpic\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;sectionId&quot;:&quot;sport&quot;,&quot;shouldHideReaderRevenue&quot;:false,&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sport/tour-de-france-2025&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Keyword&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Tour de France 2025&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sport/tourdefrance&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Keyword&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Tour de France&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sport/cycling&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Keyword&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cycling&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sport/sport&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Keyword&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Sport&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;type/article&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Type&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Article&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;tone/minutebyminute&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Tone&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Minute by minute&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;tone/news&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Tone&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;News&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;profile/ami-sedghi&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Contributor&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Amy Sedghi&quot;,&quot;bylineImageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/9/29/1285761333697/Ami-Sedghi-byline-pic-002.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=99cdf272f5468af41ef49de23f0a6848&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;profile/jeremy-whittle&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Contributor&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jeremy Whittle&quot;,&quot;twitterHandle&quot;:&quot;jeremycwhittle&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-sport&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Tracking&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;UK Sport&quot;}],&quot;isPaidContent&quot;:false,&quot;contributionsServiceUrl&quot;:&quot;https://contributions.guardianapis.com&quot;,&quot;pageId&quot;:&quot;sport/live/2025/jul/16/tour-de-france-2025-stage-11-updates-live-toulouse&quot;,&quot;keywordIds&quot;:&quot;sport/tour-de-france-2025,sport/tourdefrance,sport/cycling,sport/sport&quot;,&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}\"></gu-island></div></div>"

European football’s governing body said last week the FA Cup winners had breached its multi-club ownership rules and would play in the Conference League. Palace are expected to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport, and hundreds of supporters marched to Selhurst Park on Tuesday night to voice anger at Uefa’s decision.  Continue reading...",

It requested that the secretary of state for culture, media and sport ensure “the decision-making process is reviewed for transparency and fairness” and “the club is given a fair opportunity to appeal or respond to any allegations”.</p><p>The letter says: “As you may be aware, other clubs seem to go through much more protracted disputes with less severe outcomes. Many believe that this process has been opaque and disproportionately punitive. We hope you will take this matter seriously and act to uphold the principles of fairness, accountability, and integrity in sport.”</p><p>Dean told the Guardian: “This is heartbreaking for fans. In what should be an unblemished year of celebration for the club, officials totally disconnected from the side’s success on the pitch have issued a highly unusual and severe punishment that raises serious questions about fairness in the governance of English football. We are urging the government to back our appeal to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Uefa</a> for a thorough review of this decision. Fans must be at the centre of the game, not treated as an afterthought.”</p><p>Clubs with the same owner are barred from competing in the same Uefa competition if an individual or ownership group is considered to have a decisive influence over more than one of those teams. Uefa deemed that a move by Palace’s biggest shareholder, John Textor, whose company Eagle Football Holdings also owns Lyon, who have also qualified for the Europa League, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/23/woody-johnson-signs-deal-to-buy-john-textor-shares-crystal-palace\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">sell his stake to the New York Jets owner</a>, Woody Johnson, had come too late despite completion of the deal being imminent.</p><p>Tuesday’s march was led by the Holmesdale Fanatics, who took aim at Uefa with a banner that described it as “morally bankrupt”. They have promised to organise another protest at Uefa’s headquarters in Nyon in the coming days.</p><p>“We want to go there and put enough pressure on them and make it enough of the public issue that we can affect the decision,” said Mickey Grafton. “In short, the next step is to go to Switzerland. We need to get a delegation out there. We won’t say what we’ve got planned now.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-9\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-9\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Any appeal to Cas is likely to be fast-tracked given that the draw for the Conference League playoff round is on 4 August, and Palace are due to play the first leg three weeks later.</p></div></div>"

In baseball’s equivalent of soccer’s penalty-shootout, the game was decided by having three batters from each league take three swings each off coaches.</p><p>\n “It will be interesting to see where [the swing-off rule] goes,” said AL manager Aaron Boone of the New York Yankees. “There’s probably a world where you could see that in the future, where maybe it’s in some regular season mix. I wouldn’t be surprised if people start talking about it like that.”</p></div><p>Boone picked Brent Rooker, Randy Arozarena and Aranda on Monday, and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts picked Eugenio Suárez, Schwarber and Pete Alonso for the NL. Because Suárez was hit on the left hand by a fastball in the eighth inning, the NL turned to the team’s alternate, Kyle Stowers.</p><figure id=\"907d830e-ab55-4332-8d18-42c7ad92308b\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:5,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;MLB storylines at the All-Star break: bullpen woes, dazzling Detroit and torpedo bats reconsidered&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;907d830e-ab55-4332-8d18-42c7ad92308b&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/16/mlb-storylines-at-the-all-star-break-bullpen-woes-dazzling-detroit-and-torpedo-bats-reconsidered&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure><p>Players from both teams stood outside their dugouts, some already in street clothes, jumping and shouting after each long ball from their side. Yankees coach Travis Chapman threw to the AL batters and Dodgers coach Dino Ebel to the NL hitters.</p><p>Rooker put the AL ahead by homering on his last two swings, and Stowers hit one. Randy Arozarena boosted the AL lead to 3-1. Ebel had thrown BP to Schwarber two years ago at the WBC.</p><p>“He asked me right before, he was like, where do you want it?” Schwarber recalled “I’m like, just middle. And he’s like, ‘I gotcha.’”</p><p>He took two pitches and deposited the third just over the center-field fence. Schwarber took another, then hit a 461ft drive over the right-center bullpen. After letting two more go by, he dropped to a knee while pulling the third, craned his neck and held his bat it the air as the ball landed in the fourth row of the Chop House seats.</p><p>“I didn’t hit it, obviously, my best, but I was thinking I got enough of it,” Schwarber said. “And I was just kind of down there, hoping, saying: go, go, go. And it went. And it was awesome.”</p><p>Aranda followed with a fly well short of the center-field warning track, drove a pitch about a foot shy of the top of the right-field wall and hit an opposite-field pop that dropped in medium left.</p><p>Alonso, a two-time Home Run Derby champion, didn’t have to bat and patted Schwarber on the head as fireworks went off at Truist Field.</p><p>“I felt like a closer like a closer going into a game,” Alonso said, “and then it’s like, wait, the guy in the field got a double play to end the inning. You’re not going in.”</p><p>MLB, after consulting with the Elias Sports Bureau, said in 2022 that All-Star Games ending in a swing-off would be listed as tied, with a notation of the game being decided in a swing-off. MLB’s official postgame notes listed Tuesday’s outcome as a 7-6 NL victory.</p><p>Earlier in the game, Ketel Marte’s two-run double in the first had put the NL ahead, and Alonso’s three-run homer off Kris Bubic and Corbin Carroll’s solo shot against Casey Mize opened a 6-0 lead in the sixth.</p><p>The AL comeback began when Rooker hit a three-run pinch homer against Randy Rodríguez in a four-run seventh that included Bobby Witt Jr’s RBI groundout. Robert Suarez allowed consecutive doubles to Byron Buxton and Witt with one out in ninth, and Steven Kwan’s infield hit on a three-hopper to third off Edwin Díaz drove in the tying run.</p><p>Schwarber earned the MVP award, going 0 for 2 with a walk as the NL won for the second time in their last 12 tries. He became the first non-pitcher MVP without a hit.</p></div></div>"

To make the most of the opportunity, for starters. Towards the end of the 2013 tour he even missed the birth of his daughter May to pursue his Lions dream. “The biggest thing that stands out for me wasn’t even on the rugby field. That might sound crazy because it’s a big tour, but going back and meeting your daughter when she’s two and a half weeks old is pretty special. Changing her nappy when all the blokes are on the piss back in Sydney celebrating was, in a way, also pretty special. But, yeah, that changing room after the final Test, that would also stand out for me.”</p><p>It was only later that he belatedly apologised to his wife Elle for being “selfish” and staying out on tour – “She was like: ‘Oh God, yeah I know you are, you’ve finally admitted it’” – so it is ironic the whole family have subsequently lived in Australia since 2018, with the 29-times capped forward having made his final competitive appearance for Exeter in the 2017 Premiership final. Life in Australia has been so enjoyable that returning home to take the Leicester role vacated by Michael Cheika was not an easy decision. “We left when my youngest was three months and she’s eight now. So all my kids’ childhood has been here. I wouldn’t leave here for many opportunities. Leicester was one of those I would do.”</p><p>For now, though, his focus is on the present. Slowing down Lions’ ball, disrupting their set piece, excelling in the nuts and bolts that win Test matches. “We have some wonderful players who are highly skilled and great athletes – can we get those guys in a position to really excel? The bigger the game, the more it’s about doing the basics really well.” Does he believe the Wallabies are fully primed? “I’ve never coached a game where I wouldn’t like to be more ready. That’s been the case in every game I’ve coached or probably played in.”</p><figure id=\"77a7f4c4-8e57-45fe-bb1b-9826b842d340\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f5aec1afe37c47accdc80c6844f8811e8731e/0_0_3829_2727/master/3829.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f5aec1afe37c47accdc80c6844f8811e8731e/0_0_3829_2727/master/3829.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f5aec1afe37c47accdc80c6844f8811e8731e/0_0_3829_2727/master/3829.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f5aec1afe37c47accdc80c6844f8811e8731e/0_0_3829_2727/master/3829.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f5aec1afe37c47accdc80c6844f8811e8731e/0_0_3829_2727/master/3829.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f5aec1afe37c47accdc80c6844f8811e8731e/0_0_3829_2727/master/3829.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"On duty as Australia shocked England at Twickenham in the autumn.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f5aec1afe37c47accdc80c6844f8811e8731e/0_0_3829_2727/master/3829.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"316.927396186994\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>On duty as Australia shocked England at Twickenham in the autumn.</span> Photograph: Andrew Fosker/INPHO/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>But not unlike England’s Steve Borthwick, Parling has always been a relentless rugby student. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/09/england-australia-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Australia’s dramatic win at Twickenham last November</a> was also further proof of the Wallabies’ ability to confound expectations.

He was very simple in his delivery ... he just [prioritised] a few things and went hard at those. I think sometimes we make coaching too complicated. He didn’t.”</p><p>Which is something Parling will also be aware of this weekend, conscious that words alone cannot fully prepare his players. “In these big games something always takes you a little bit by surprise. I can’t give them everything by just speaking. Every player will have their own motivations. They’re aware it’s pretty special. I don’t think I have to big it up as anything else.”</p></div></div>"

The way she took the first goal in Sweden's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cwyrxxrlz2xt#MatchStats\">4-1 win over Germany</a> showed a real intelligence to keep onside. It was top-level forward play.</p><p>She has been accused of missing clear-cut chances, but she executed that perfectly. That will have given her a real boost.</p><p>Sweden had 48% possession against Germany, but they showed they could handle pressure because they had weapons on the counter-attack. Blackstenius is a focal point for the team and the one that probably allows Sweden to play more direct when they need to.</p><p>England centre-backs Williamson and Jess Carter need to have good awareness of where Blackstenius is. They need to get it right positionally.</p><p>They need to get tight to her in the box when the ball goes out wide because Blackstenius is really good in the air. Sweden recorded the most open-play crosses during the group stage (61) and they are dangerous in those situations.</p><p>Williamson showed her defensive strengths in the Champions League final. She came up against top-quality forwards and used her pace and reading of the game to intercept passes.</p><p>She is so composed on the ball that she can play her way out of pressure. That is so important for the way England build from the back.</p><p>Carter complements Williamson well because she can distribute off both feet and is very good at using her body to block runs.</p><p>Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton has a role to play in helping England's centre-backs by reducing the space Blackstenius has to run in behind.</p><p>There was a lot of noise around Hampton becoming number one, but her distribution has been excellent so the Sweden defence need to be wary of that. If they push up too high she can play long balls over the top.</p><p>Teams have analysed England and looked at ways they can exploit them, which has often been through those direct passes or outpacing the defence. But there is no way England will not acknowledge Sweden's strengths. They will be prepared.</p></div><div data-component=\"media-block\"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>England thrash Wales to seal quarter-final spot</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"Rytting-Kaneryd-v-Greenwood\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">Rytting Kaneryd v Greenwood</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Sweden might try and press England high up the pitch. If they do that with Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, then England can keep their forwards isolated against the Sweden full-backs and Lauren Hemp can run at them one-v-one.</p><p>England defender Alex Greenwood can put dangerous balls into the right areas with her distribution. The quality of her left foot is so good that she can play it perfectly down the line for Hemp and send her off.</p><p>It is one of the benefits of having Greenwood in the left-back position. There is more balance to England's defence since she moved there.</p><p>Greenwood will be aware of Rytting Kaneryd's dribbling ability. That is one of the Chelsea forward's super-strengths. She likes to carry the ball past players and get in the box. She is also great at crossing the ball from wide areas - 65% of Sweden's chances created from open play came down her right-hand side in the group stages.</p><p>Rytting Kaneryd also has that trademark 'chop' that catches defenders out all the time in the box. Greenwood needs to stay on her feet, and it is better to keep Rytting Kaneryd out wide as she is more dangerous coming inside.</p><p>While England need to be wary of Sweden's wingers, it is the same the other way. Lauren James is just as dangerous to Sweden.</p></div><div data-component=\"media-block\"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Women's Euro 2025 - Best goals of the group stage</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"The-midfield-battle\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">The midfield battle</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>It will be interesting to see how Sweden's midfield lines up.</p><p>Hanna Bennison started the win over Germany. She has great technical ability and is so creative. She is probably more attacking, though, so I wonder if Sweden will bring in Julia Zigiotti Olme against England's creative midfield to add more physical presence.</p><p>Zigiotti Olme can keep things ticking but will also put a foot in. She might be able to do both sides of the game better. There is a good blend in Sweden's midfield.</p><p>London City Lionesses midfielder Kosovare Asllani plays in that number 10 role behind Blackstenius and is the link between midfield and attack.</p><p>Asllani is clever with the timing of her movement and has been involved in four of Sweden's eight goals in the tournament. She has good footwork and is a really experienced player. It does not seem like the magnitude of games affects her.</p><p>Filippa Angeldal has really good vision and can recognise when to push up and when to hold back.</p><p>We saw glimpses of what she could do at Manchester City, but she did not get consistent minutes and now it looks like she has had a new lease of life at Real Madrid. She is reinvigorated and playing so well. She understands her role at Sweden and how effective she can be.</p><p>England manager Sarina Wiegman will pick the same midfield three. The balance was lacking against France and they did not recognise the threats. But they have certainly improved on that.</p><p>Georgia Stanway has been putting tackles in and adding more bite, which England needed. Ella Toone has come in and connected well with Alessia Russo and James.</p><p>Keira Walsh has been getting close to the box and putting in shots. Her team-mates even joked that she is chasing the Golden Boot. That is when England are at their best.</p><p><i>Anita Asante was speaking to BBC Sport's Emma Sanders</i>.</p></div><section data-component=\"links-block\"><p><h2 type=\"normal\">More on this story</h2></p><ul role=\"list\"><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>"

Finding diamonds in the rough is often the focus of Fantasy football managers, but avoiding 2025 Fantasy football busts is just as important this draft season. Fantasy football injuries might seem unforeseeable and sometimes are, but there are often hints in a player's injury history and other indicators that a player's production might fall off before it happens.</p><p>For example, Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco suffered multiple injuries in 2023, but an inability to evade tacklers also preceded a major drop in 2024. With a reliable set of 2025 Fantasy football rankings, you can avoid making major mistakes on players you're anticipating will start in your Fantasy football lineups. So before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07082025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbusts\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>Last year, the model accurately predicted that Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert would fall well short of his ADP (RB23). The result: A season after rushing for over 1,000 yards and scoring 21 total touchdowns despite sharing time with De'Von Achane, Mostert fell out of favor in Miami and finished as RB60 after managing only 439 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.</p>\n        \n\n<p>The model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy Football sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking. The 2025 Fantasy football PPR rankings and 2025 Fantasy football standard rankings update multiple times daily, so you're always getting the best Fantasy football advice.</p><p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07082025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbusts\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football busts</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football busts the model is predicting: Saints running back <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804034/cam-akers/fantasy/\">Cam Akers</a>. The former second-round pick showed some promise early in his career with the Rams, but he fell out of favor with Sean McVay and has bounced around over the last two seasons trying to find a role that puts his career back on track.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Now he's landed with the Saints and managers appear to be operating under the assumption that he can win a backup role to Alvin Kamara and potentially even feature prominently in Kellen Moore's offense. However, he isn't even a lock to make the roster and has the potential to be a big disappointment even as a depth play. Akers is currently the 34th running back coming off the board on average in PPR leagues, but the model ranks him outside its top 75 backs.</p><p>Another bust that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701883/marvin-harrison-jr/fantasy/\">Marvin Harrison Jr</a>, who has an over/under of 975.5 receiving yards this year. In the grand scheme of things, 62 catches for 886 yards and eight touchdowns is a solid rookie season. However, expectations were a bit higher than that for the namesake of a Pro Football Hall-of-Famer who was drafted No. 4 overall and landed with an organization where he was the clear-cut No. 1 WR.</p><p>Now expectations are that he'll take a step forward -- which is certainly possible -- but there are some concerning peripherals here. He finished 70th among NFL receivers in yards after catch (148) and 107th in average target separation (1.03 yards). Harrison is one of the first 20 wide receivers being drafted so far this season, but the model ranks him comfortably outside the top 20 behind fellow fifth and sixth-round receivers like D.J. Moore, DK Metcalf and Xavier Worthy.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07082025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbusts\" target=\"_blank\">See which other Fantasy football busts 2025 to pick here</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankings</h2><p>SportsLine is also fading one of the first five running backs off the board in early 2025 Fantasy football drafts. The model ranks this player falling outside the top 10 entirely and failing to live up to his first-round price tag.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07082025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbusts\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025 Fantasy Football busts should you be steering clear of?

With NFL training camps rapidly approaching, managers everywhere are on the hunt for news about players who are rocketing up the depth chart. Buccaneers running back Bucky Irving was a fourth-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, but he started making waves during his first offseason in Tampa Bay. He eventually overtook Rachaad White as the top option in the Bucs' backfield and rushed for 1,122 yards and eight scores in his rookie season.</p><p>Now Irving, who has an over/under of 1,005.5 rushing yards this season, is coming off the board in the first couple rounds of 2025 Fantasy football drafts, but the race is one to identify 2025 Fantasy football sleepers and breakouts. A live-updated set of 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you do exactly that, while they can also help you avoid potential 2025 Fantasy football busts. Before setting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>Last year, the model accurately predicted that Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud might take a step back in his second season. He finished as QB18 and anybody who avoided drafting him early dodged a major headache in their Fantasy football lineups. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and calling Rachaad White's breakout in 2023. Additionally, it has called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.</p><p>The model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking. The 2025 Fantasy football PPR rankings and 2024 Fantasy football standard projections update multiple times daily, so you're always getting the best Fantasy football advice.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest 2025 Fantasy football rankings, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Raiders quarterback Geno Smith. The Raiders traded a third-round draft pick for Smith in March, signing him to a two-year contract extension. He will be playing in a new-look offense under offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, who has utilized an up-tempo pace throughout his coaching career.</p><p>Smith has some intriguing weapons in Las Vegas, including rising star tight end Brock Bowers and dependable veteran Jakobi Meyers. The Raiders also added rookie running back Ashton Jeanty in the draft to provide some balance. Smith was the QB13 in Fantasy scoring last year, and the model has him as a top-20 quarterback this season despite his ADP of 25.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football sleepers 2025 here</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Giants wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson. The 24-year-old receiver enters his fourth NFL season, so although he's later in his career than your typical breakout, Robinson isn't much older than the incoming rookie class. Robinson played his entire rookie season at 21 years old, whereas many of the top rookie receivers are entering this season at 22. Robinson had more receptions (93) and targets (140) last year than in his first two seasons combined.</p><p>Robinson was a second-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft after having 104 receptions for 1,333 yards in 13 games as a junior at Kentucky. He was used more in New York as the season progressed, including 10 receptions in the final game of the season. With offensive head coach Brian Daboll remaining in place, that involvement could continue to rise. The model has Robinson in the range of more high-profile receivers like Rome Odunze, Chris Olave and Jayden Reed in its 2025 Fantasy football rankings as it projects Robinson to be a more reliable Fantasy football receiver this year.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football breakouts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football busts</h2><p>As for players to avoid, the model lists Falcons wide receiver Drake London as one of its 2025 Fantasy football busts. The No. 8 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft showed flashes of potential while catching 141 passes for 1,771 yards and six touchdowns over his first two seasons. However, he finally established himself as a bonafide No. 1 receiver last year with 100 catches for 1,271 yards and nine touchdowns.</p>\n        \n\n<p>London's numbers even ticked up over the last three games of the season when Michael Penix replaced Kirk Cousins as the starter in Atlanta, but the passing game benefited from playing soft defenses during that stretch and the model expects tougher sledding in Penix's first full season as a starter. London has been the ninth wide receiver off the board on average in early 2025 Fantasy football drafts but the model puts him in WR2 territory by ranking him outside its top 12 wideouts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football busts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2>How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football football rankings</h2><p>SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising wide receiver you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy football drafts. This wide receiver is listed as a shocking top-15 option ahead of stars like A.J. Brown and Tyreek Hill.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025 Fantasy Football sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which WR shocks the NFL with a top-15 performance? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get 2025 Fantasy Football cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that called C.J.

We probably receive more than 1,000 emails during an average Test, hundreds of which are published. As an epic Lord’s Test unfolded, the same question kept dropping into our inboxes. “This is the second innings of the series that has left me baffled as to how KL Rahul averages only 35 in Tests,” began one such email from Ned Blackburn. “He seems to have the temperament, technique and discipline to be absolutely elite. What am I missing?” Rahul’s Test average has become the unsolved mystery of the English summer. But after a day in the statistical dirt – and Ben Stokes thought he went to some dark places on Monday – we can offer some potential explanations. The simplest reason is that after a fine start to his career he became a superstar of Indian cricket, a status that is Kryptonite for an overthinker. “I just couldn’t get out of my own head,” he said in late 2023. “I couldn’t leave cricket or my professional life on the field.

He averaged 26 from 28 Tests played between November 2017 and December 2023, including a desperate tour of England in 2018. Rahul made 113 runs in the first eight innings – including a technical change halfway through the Lord’s Test that solved one problem and created an even bigger one – before a dead-rubber century in the final Test.</p><p>Amid the extended struggle at Test level, there were two reminders of Rahul’s cathedral-high ceiling. In 2021 he made magnificent centuries in the toughest conditions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/12/england-india-second-test-day-two-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">at Lord’s</a> and Centurion. Kevin Pietersen was often described as “a player of great innings rather than a great player”. Rahul played great innings in 2021, yet his overall record suggested he wasn’t even a very good player.</p><p>He has never been good at squeezing metaphorical lemons. The great batters usually wring every run out of a spell of good form; Rahul has always flattered to deceive. The current England tour is the first time he has made two centuries in one series and only the second time he’s managed three 50+ scores. For a player of his ability, those statistics are downright offensive.</p><p>Rahul had a different problem against Australia in 2016-17, when he stroked six fifties in seven innings, only to find weird and wonderful ways to get out without reaching three figures. He also has a poor appetite for cheap runs, a virtue in many ways but damaging in a game where statistics are gospel.</p><p>Just as Rahul has left plenty of runs out in the middle, so he has been denied access to plenty through injury or selection. The first example came in 2015, when he missed a one-off Test in Bangladesh through illness. The new opening pair, Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan, banged 150 and 173 respectively in India’s only innings.</p><figure id=\"eabdb157-da1d-45bc-9500-8c333ae4c272\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3801f83fb071f0387fe3c62a5ac27c5528c8a8d/0_0_5329_3505/master/5329.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3801f83fb071f0387fe3c62a5ac27c5528c8a8d/0_0_5329_3505/master/5329.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3801f83fb071f0387fe3c62a5ac27c5528c8a8d/0_0_5329_3505/master/5329.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3801f83fb071f0387fe3c62a5ac27c5528c8a8d/0_0_5329_3505/master/5329.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3801f83fb071f0387fe3c62a5ac27c5528c8a8d/0_0_5329_3505/master/5329.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3801f83fb071f0387fe3c62a5ac27c5528c8a8d/0_0_5329_3505/master/5329.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"KL Rahul walks out to bat at Lord’s\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3801f83fb071f0387fe3c62a5ac27c5528c8a8d/0_0_5329_3505/master/5329.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"292.6862450741227\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>KL Rahul walks out to bat on day four at Lord’s.</span> Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>There were few dissenting voices when, after a two-year struggle, Rahul was dropped for the series against South Africa in 2019. In that series, the openers Rohit Sharma and Mayank Agarwal smashed five centuries, three of them huge, in only eight innings.</p><p>Such series are not the norm. The 2000s were an excellent time to open the batting in Tests, but it has since gone back to being the hardest gig in batting. Statistically, the 2020s are the toughest decade for openers since the 1900s. And while it doesn’t tell the whole story, one comparison suggests Rahul may not have done too badly. In the 61 Tests he has played, the other Indian openers – Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rohit, Dhawan and the rest – have a combined average of 37.55. That’s 0.6 better than Rahul when he joins them at the top.</p><p>Just as Peter Willey played 15 of his 26 Tests against the West Indies’ four horsemen, so Rahul’s excellence in tough conditions has probably counted against him. A startling 48% of his Tests have been in Sena countries (the abbreviation for South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia, usually the toughest tours for subcontinental batters). Seven of his 10 Test hundreds have also been scored in those games.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-12\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>There should be more to come. At 33, Rahul looks like a man who has worked it out. Marriage and fatherhood have made him more relaxed about cricket. He is also less vulnerable to the psychological self-harm of social media and rolling opinion after making a conscious decision to change his habits. “Since then,” he said, “my life has been more peaceful.”</p><p>On the 2018 tour of England, Rahul was a walking wicket; seven years later he is more of a walking epiphany. He didn’t shy away from the conflict when the Lord’s Test threatened to turn nuclear, but he looked more detached – even amused – than the rest. He wears his seniority well. In a new, young India team, Rahul has gone from underachiever to Zen uncle.</p><p>Cricket has umpteen stories of supreme talents who finally worked it out at the back end of their careers, from Carl Hooper and Justin Langer to Graham Gooch and his mentor Ken Barrington. At the start of 1990, Gooch had an unbecoming average of 36.90. Five run-kissed years later, when he retired, it was 42.58.</p><p>Right now, in July 2025, there are lies, damned lies and KL Rahul’s Test average. But it’s not too late for the truth to emerge.</p><ul>\n <li>\n  <p><em><strong>This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-spin\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions</a>.</strong></em></p></li>\n</ul></div></div>"

Six of the Scottish Premiership’s 12 clubs are now American-owned. The 49ers’ purchase of Rangers wasn’t even the only US takeover of a Scottish club this summer: Calvin Ford, the great-great-grandson of Henry Ford, completed a deal to buy Livingston. Scotland’s top division is now just one club away from having a majority of American owners.</p><p>The trend started in 2013 when Tim Keyes and John Nelms turned up at Dundee. Five years later, Mark Ogren bought Dundee United. More recently, Bournemouth owner Bill Foley invested in Hibernian, who have been owned by the Gordon family since 2019, while St Johnstone were bought by Adam Webb. All Americans and all bullish on the untapped potential of Scottish soccer.</p><figure id=\"b18ed826-338d-4d22-9db5-50ca1694021a\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘It’s not fair’: Crystal Palace fans march in protest at demotion from Europa League&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;b18ed826-338d-4d22-9db5-50ca1694021a&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/15/its-not-fair-crystal-palace-fans-march-in-protest-at-demotion-from-europa-league&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure><p>Of course, American investment in soccer is not unique to Scotland. Half of the Premier League’s 20 clubs now under US ownership following Dan Friedkin’s takeover of Everton in September, adding the film producer’s name to a list that includes Foley, Fenway Sports Group, the Glazers, Stan Kroenke, Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, Wes Edens, John Textor and Shahid Khan. Nine EFL clubs, including Birmingham City and Wrexham, are also American-owned, offering a lower on-ramp for those without the funds to go toe-to-toe with a sovereign wealth fund.</p><p>The on-ramp to get into Scottish soccer is even lower, partially explaining why so many American millionaires have looked north of the England/Scotland border to invest. While the 49ers were able to snag a majority ownership stake in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Rangers</a> for £150m ($200m), New York Jets owner Woody Johnson has agreed to pay more than that (£190m/$254m) for a smaller share (44.9%) in Crystal Palace, a club that finished 12th in the Premier League last season. Friedkin had to pay over £400m ($535m) for Everton who have spent the last few seasons flirting with relegation.</p><p>Rangers can only look enviously over Hadrian’s Wall at the self-proclaimed Best League In The World and its associated riches, but they do have access to European soccer. Indeed, the Govan club made a run to the Europa League final three seasons ago and played in the Champions League two seasons ago, earning tens of millions in the process.</p><p>Today there are more Scottish teams in Europe than ever before, largely due to the creation of the Conference League. The likes of Aberdeen, Dundee United, Hearts, Hibernian, Kilmarnock, Motherwell and St Mirren were previously locked out of continental competition on account of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Celtic</a> and Rangers’ strength, all have qualified for the Conference League in recent seasons, giving them a path to continental football and associated financial rewards.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-8\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-8\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id=\"d5edf4c5-a4f3-466a-99a9-80186795f0f1\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:9,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Celtic’s coronation shows Scotland needs end to 40 years of title tedium | Ewan Murray&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d5edf4c5-a4f3-466a-99a9-80186795f0f1&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/16/celtic-scottish-premiership-title-tedium-rangers&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure><p>This along with the rise of multi-club ownership has changed the investment landscape in Scottish soccer. Hibernian are part of Foley’s Black Knight network that includes Bournemouth, Auckland City and FC Lorient. Brighton owner Tony Bloom recently acquired a stake in Hearts that puts the Edinburgh club under the same umbrella as the Premier League club and Belgian champions Union Saint-Gilloise. Aberdeen have a partnership with Atlanta United.</p><p>And now, with the 49ers purchase, Rangers have a connection with Leeds United. But which club sits higher in the hierarchy? Scottish fans are insecure about their position in the food chain and the growth of multi-club ownership has only exacerbated that anxiety.</p><p>Not every new American owner has been welcomed with open arms. Motherwell supporters last year voted against a takeover by US-based Erik and Courtney Barmack, a former Netflix vice-president and a Snap Inc executive. Foley, too, has faced questions. Should Hibernian really be a feeder club to Bournemouth, a team with an average attendance of just over 11,000 last season that had until fairly recently played most of its history in the lower leagues? Perhaps not, but this is the reality of the modern game.</p><p>It’s also an indication of how Scottish soccer needs help. It’s been 40 years since a team not called Celtic or Rangers won the title. A study commissioned by the Scottish FA last year said the sport is “significantly underachieving” in youth potential compared to other countries of a similar size. Just 12% of all minutes in the Scottish Premiership last season were given to players age 21 or under.</p><p>And while more Scottish teams are involved in Europe, none made it past the group stage of the most recent Conference League, a fact made starker by Irish side Shamrock Rovers’ run to the knockout phase last season. The hope was that the new third-tier competition would give Scottish clubs a platform to reach new heights. Instead, it has exposed just how far off the required standard they are.</p><p>There’s no guarantee American money will change any of this. Nelms has been in charge at Dundee for over a decade, but has yet to turn the club into the talent factory he originally planned. St Johnstone suffered relegation for the first time in 16 years last season not long after the arrival of new owners. Their fans expected more.</p><p>The history of Scottish soccer and the passion of its fans is part of what makes it so attractive to outsider investors. So too is the sense that the Scottish game, with some new ideas and renewed ambition, could be something more. The American dream has taken on a tartan tinge.</p></div></div>"

So, how did it go? Here’s a handful of storylines to chew on as we prepare for the second-half stretch run.</p><h2 id=\"what-hasnt-happened\">What hasn’t happened</h2><p>Remember the torpedo bats that were a destroyer of worlds in the season’s opening days? Some geniuses even said they were the latest example of how “over-innovation can ruin baseball” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/01/new-york-yankees-torpedo-bats\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">(no idea who wrote that zinger)</a>. Well, so far that’s looking like <em>the</em> kneejerk reaction of the season, or maybe several seasons. The Yankees, who are the chief adapters of the redesigned bats that boast customized sweet spots, hit 15 home runs in three games against Milwaukee at the start of the season. Then they calmed down and struck 1.46 home runs per game from then on. Yes, they still lead the league in homers, and yes, they’re averaging more dingers per game than they did last year when Juan Soto was in their lineup. But the tech has <em>not</em> in fact made a complete farce of the game. Has Cal Raleigh, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/01/cal-raleigh-big-dumper-seattle-mariners-mvp-case\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the Mariners’ torpedo bat swinging MVP candidate</a>, been aided by the innovation? Well, he has 38 homers this season, four more than his career-high already, while Triple Crown candidate Aaron Judge, who doesn’t use a torpedo bat, has 35. This time, let’s go with a more conservative take on the bats: the jury’s still out.</p><figure id=\"a24ff254-85e7-4289-b484-b4d426cfe0fd\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Cal Raleigh’s wild, breakout season continued with a win at the Home Run Derby in Atlanta on Monday.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f23d4bf2f8291e94456fd9b498cd89090d3247/0_0_4570_3047/master/4570.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.699124726477\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Cal Raleigh’s wild, breakout season continued with a win at the Home Run Derby in Atlanta on Monday.</span> Photograph: Mike Stewart/AP</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"oh-the-bullpens\">Oh, the bullpens …</h2><p>What drives fans the most crazy? The way their manager handles his bullpen. Don’t believe me? Try searching “bullpen management” on X and see what comes up; it’s not pretty. But here’s the thing: when your starting pitchers average well under six innings a game, and you have to figure out how to get an additional nine, 12, 15 outs or more, where’s the roadmap for that? There isn’t one – managers make it up on the fly most nights. With a bevy of starters recovering from elbow injuries, while upper management continues to nurse the long men, desperate brass are forced to shuttle relievers between the minors and the majors looking for fresh arms. It’s pretty ugly. Is anyone getting it “right?” Well, few outside LA are going to sympathize with the super-rich Dodgers, but their skipper Dave Roberts is getting just <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2025-starter-pitching.shtml\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">4.5 innings a game</a> from his beleaguered, injury riddled starters, the worst number in all of baseball (<a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2025-starter-pitching.shtml\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the MLB average is 5.2</a>). Apparently there’s more than a few teams that’ll be looking for bullpen help at the 31 July trade deadline. Yeah, you think?</p><h2 id=\"stand-up-for-detroit\">Stand up for Detroit</h2><p>Remember last July when the Tigers were dealing away players, and then somehow made the playoffs and came within a single victory of the American League Championship Series? Well, as it turns out, that run was no fluke. The Tigers have an 11.5 game lead in the AL Central at the break, the largest such lead they’ve had since the All-Star Game began in 1933. For context, the historic 1984 Tigers that began 35-5 had an eight-game lead at the break. Detroit own the best record in all of baseball, even after losing their last four games.</p><figure id=\"cee5a0ef-fb09-4177-8068-cf601b6858c2\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"When it comes to time for Tarik Skubal to pitch, just wind him up and let him go. \" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61a2eeecb0cc60f583a9a61e68802de1d6a33e4/0_0_3019_2012/master/3019.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.5684001324942\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>When it comes to time for Tarik Skubal to pitch, just wind him up and let him go. <br></span> Photograph: Jose Juarez/AP</figcaption></figure><p>So what’s gone right? Tarik Skubal has stiff competition from Boston’s Garrett Crochet in his bid to win a second successive Cy Young, but the Tigers hurler has walked just 16 batters in 121 innings – an astonishingly low number. Meanwhile, Detroit’s lineup is full of redemption songs, with three players in the top five favored for the AL Comeback Player of the Year award (Rangers ace Jacob deGrom leads that group). Former No 1 overall pick Spencer Torkelson has recovered from an abysmal 2024 to power up a Tigers offense driven by Gleyber Torres, Riley Greene and Zach McKinstry, allowing the bats to overshadow a middle-of-the road pitching staff, Skubal aside. But perhaps the story of the season is Javier Baez. The once big-dollar-bust is an All-Star this season, and has upped his OPS by more than 230 points from last season and is Detroit’s face of mojo as they head to the second half of the season.</p><h2 id=\"the-lost-boys\">The Lost Boys</h2><p>The Colorado Rockies weren’t daunted by the 2024 White Sox’ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/27/the-2024-chicago-white-sox-a-team-so-historically-bad-they-stopped-tweeting-results\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">modern MLB record</a> for losses in a season.

Their lack of competitive play is even enough to get Commissioner Rob Manfred <a href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/rob-manfred-mlb-deal-issue-pirates-other-non-competitive-teams\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">somewhat “concerned” about the Buccos</a>, not to mention teams such as the Marlins, who lead a system of meandering franchises whose ownership appear uninterested in winning. Clearly a salary cap, which every other major North American sports league has in some form or other, could help with such imbalance. But with a divide between rich and richer owners and a players’ union that’s fought against a cap for its entire existence, that will always be a tough sell, and so the issue will be a source of labor strife after the 2026 season.</p><p>And speaking of a tough sell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mlb\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">MLB</a> has been trying to unload a short-term package of games since ESPN opted out of the final three years of their rights deal worth roughly $1.5bn. Manfred, who admitted that having to find another suitor to replace those lost dollars is not all that fun, says there’s been “progress” in that search and says he should have some news in the coming weeks.</p><h2 id=\"odds-and-ends\">Odds and ends</h2><p>Thanks to breakout star Pete-Crowe Armstrong, Kyle Tucker, Nico Hoerner and virtually everyone else in the Cubbies lineup, Chicago are having their biggest <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45658219/2025-mlb-first-half-mvps-stories-playoff-odds-all-30-teams-ohtani-judge-july-fourth\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">OPS+year since, well, 1884</a>. They lead the Brewers in the NL Central by a single game. In the NL East, the Phillies have power issues, but it’s Zach Wheeler and their starting pitching that’s given them a short lead over the Mets, who started fast and fell faster, losing 17 of 27 games heading into the break. In the AL East, the Yankees slumped themselves out of first place, while the surprising Blue Jays overtook the Bombers despite an inferior run difference. The once hotter than hot Rays traded places with the Red Sox who rode a 10-game winning streak into third place at the break, all after controversially trading away Rafael Devers and losing Alex Bregman to injury. The Houston Astros of the AL West dealt away their best player, Tucker, in the offseason, but look better without him: hurlers Framber Valdez, Hunter Brown and a white hot pen have the ‘Stros in a commanding first place position after an un-Astro-like 2024. In the NL West, the “Best Team Ever” are yet to play like it, but then again, LA have been missing most of their rotation for most of the season.</p><figure id=\"f26e7429-177c-4a9e-a57b-fed2f9366325\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-5\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"What doesn’t Shohei Ohtani do?\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25dc3ac4c76be662b6c285c0e12f5207f942f0a/0_0_7791_5194/master/7791.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>What doesn’t Shohei Ohtani do?</span> Photograph: Godofredo A Vásquez/AP</figcaption></figure><p>The Dodgers are likely to get stronger when it matters though. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/shohei-ohtani\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Shohei Ohtani</a> is pitching again and has an ERA just over one as he stretches out for the postseason, Tyler Glasnow just returned, with Blake Snell and Roki Sasaki to follow.

A topic frequently discussed but that never goes away.</p><p>Only 72.3 overs were bowled on day two of the third Test at Lord's.</p><p>That means, including the necessary time taken for a change of innings, 15 overs were lost from the match not because of rain or bad light but because of the slowness of play.</p><p>A further 19 overs were lost over days three and four.</p><p>There was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cq8zw081p7go\">Indian frustration</a> at the end of day three as England opener Zak Crawley used delaying tactics, meaning one over took seven minutes.</p><p>England have subsequently been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c4g8y80zmkpo\">docked two points</a> in the World Test Championship (WTC) and fined 10% of their match fee for a slow over-rate. </p><p>They were deemed to be below the required rate despite mitigating circumstances, including India captain Shubman Gill having an eight-minute massage on the outfield and Ravindra Jadeja taking a toilet break while batting on day five.</p><p>The stoppages are a poor look for the sport, but what are the rules, do over-rates matter and what can be done?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"What-are-the-rules\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">What are the rules?</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>In a five-day Test, 90 overs are scheduled for each day.</p><p>To prevent teams tactically wasting time to ensure a draw, all of the overs must be bowled on the fifth day, barring interruptions for the weather.</p><p>On the previous days, the overs must be fitted into the six hours of play, with an extra half hour made available at the end of the day.</p><p>While time can be made up for overs lost to the weather, there is no such provision when the reason is simply slow play. If overs are not bowled in that time they are lost from the match.</p><p>There are some penalties already in place in the International Cricket Council's playing conditions but they have limited impact.</p><p>An umpire can, after an initial warning, award five penalty runs to an opposition if one team are deemed to be wasting time. This rule has never been enforced in Test cricket.</p><p>A stop clock was also introduced last month where a timer counts down from 60 seconds between overs. Again, five penalty runs can be awarded but, despite warnings during the first two Tests, neither captain was punished.</p><p>More common are fines against captains and, in the WTC league phase, points deductions.</p><p>At the end of a WTC match various caveats are taken into accounts, such as injuries and umpire reviews, and a calculation is made as to how far behind the required over-rate a team was. </p><p>The regulations state: \"A team will have one point deducted from its points total for each penalty over it incurs.\"</p><p>England were docked 22 points during the 2023-25 cycle. Captain Ben Stokes has pointed out his team are at a disadvantage because pace bowlers, with their longer run-ups, bowl more overs in the UK than other countries where spin plays a greater part.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"What-has-changed\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">What has changed?</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The over-rate debate is not new. </p><p>The number of overs bowled per hour has dropped steadily throughout the history of Test cricket, in part down to developments in the game such as umpire reviews, boundary checks, concussion protocol and TV advert breaks.</p><p>Prior to World War Two the average over-rate was about 21 per hour. That dropped to 18 between 1945 and 1974, 14.3 from 1975 to 1999 and 14 since 2000.</p><p>Things have taken a further turn in this England-India series. The over-rate across the first two Tests was 13.3 per hour, with 39 overs lost in the first Test and 19 in the second.</p><p>A major factor has been the ball. Both teams have repeatedly asked for the ball to be changed because it has gone soft and out of shape. This has led to delays to allow umpires to check the shape and possibly replace the ball.</p><p>There have been other lengthy breaks too. </p><p>On day two at Lord's the first drinks break lasted about six minutes, rather than the standard four.</p><p>Given the high temperatures in London, there were regular unscheduled drinks breaks and pauses for batters to change their gloves. </p><p>There have also been a number of breaks for minor injury treatment.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"What-have-the-players-said\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">What have the players said?</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>England batter Joe Root and India bowler Jasprit Bumrah were asked about the issue after the second day's play.</p><p>Root suggested teams should only be allowed three attempts to change the ball per innings to save some time.</p><p>\"I don't want to get myself in trouble by trying to rewrite the thing, but that's one way of policing the ball thing,\" Root said. </p><p>\"In terms of over-rates, it can be quite difficult on a day like today. </p><p>\"We're not used to this, are we? Thirty [degrees] in England feels like 45 elsewhere. But I guess just try and keep on top of it as much as you can.\"</p><p>A point of debate is whether rushing through the overs would diminish the quality of play. Although time was lost, Friday's play was action-packed.</p><p>There are also fewer draws in Tests now than ever before, meaning a result is still found despite the overs lost.</p><p>\"It's hot out there,\" said Bumrah. \"It's tough on the bowlers.</p><p>\"Sometimes you have to take your time because you don't want your quality to be compromised. You don't want to be too rushed.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"What-do-the-experts-think\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">What do the experts think?</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p><b>Former England captain Michael Vaughan: </b></p><p>When it gets to the fifth day you have to bowl the 90 overs. I have no idea why on days one, two, three or four we see the game played at a snail's pace. </p><p>On day five when the players and umpires know 90 have to be bowled, they are running around. There won't be as many unofficial drinks breaks. </p><p>I would make it simple. You have to bowl 90 overs in a day regardless of the time.</p><p><b>BBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew:</b></p><p>I have spent 30 years banging on about over-rates. On the face of it is it boring but it is actually really important because it is just a terrible look. </p><p>You cannot have up to 15 overs not being bowled. It is totally unacceptable.</p><p>It is like going to the cinema, watching Pearl and Dean and then the lights go on and you are kicked out. Fines don't work.</p><p>Now teams have time allowed for breaks but they should be penalised on that. There should be a stop clock for drinks breaks. Every time someone comes on to the field to bring gloves or drinks on a clock should start and that counts against that team.</p><p>Then you have to impose penalty runs. It is the only currency players understand.</p><p><b>Test Match Special statistician Andy Zaltzman:</b></p><p>The general play in Test cricket is really good but surely it would be improved by having more of it per day.</p><p>There is a clock between overs now and the only problem is players completely ignore it. </p><p>You need an in-game penalty of runs against the batting or bowling side if they are obviously wasting time, maybe with a green or yellow card warning system.</p><p><b>Former England captain Sir Alastair Cook: </b></p><p>The issue has been going on for years. </p><p>I am not blaming the players. It is time for the ICC and the umpires to step in. The speed of play is their responsibility. Drinks breaks need to be shorter.</p><p>As players you will always push the boundaries. A 10:30 start would allow another half an hour but would just add to the overall issue. </p><p>As a captain the last thing you are worried about is the speed of play. You are aware of it because you get fined, but the game is far more important for you. It is about winning that moment.</p><p><b>BBC cricket commentator Simon Mann:</b></p><p>We need a proper penalty to concentrate players' minds. You could have a run penalty but it is a little artificial. </p><p>I would calculate how many overs the batting or bowling side is down - it is not just the bowling side that wastes time - and next time they bowl take a fielder off for two, three or five overs. </p><p><b>Former England bowler Steven Finn:</b></p><p>A run penalty would be better than a monetary fine. The problem is there are quite a lot of things that aren't the fault of the bowling team at all - gloves changed too frequently, treatment for minor injuries.</p><p>It is more complicated than simply punishing the bowling team and I wouldn't want the quality of cricket to be diminished by rushing through too much.</p><p><b>BBC cricket presenter and commentator Isa Guha:</b></p><p>Slow over-rates have been a problem for a long time in Test cricket and I feel sorry for the spectators who pay good money and feel like they are missing out on action they have paid for. </p><p>We can be a bit more flexible with the hours of play and start half an hour earlier the following day to complete overs lost the previous day. We are all here as broadcasters and it would be straightforward to communicate that to the spectators. That would be my solution.</p></div><section data-component=\"links-block\"><p><h2 type=\"normal\">More on this story</h2></p><ul role=\"list\"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>"

a second meeting in the final nine games before the play-offs.</p><p>Of course, league position at any given point of a season cannot be predicted in advance, but Warrington have had a difficult run-in so far in 2025.</p><p>Not only have the Challenge Cup finalists faced significant injury challenges, their meeting with Salford on 4 July was only the fourth time they had faced an opponent in the bottom four of Super League.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"Juggling-the-schedule\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">Juggling the schedule</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>When the RFL compile the following season's fixtures late in the preceding year, there are more obstacles to getting the list in order than it initially appears.</p><p>Maximising television audiences, stadium availability and pitch resurfacing can all impact on when teams play and who they will face, with resurfacing sometimes having a prolonged influence on some teams' schedules.</p><p>Wigan played six away games in a row due to work being undertaken on the pitch at the Brick Community Stadium home they share with football club Wigan Athletic, whose season came to an end in May.</p><p>Similarly, Warrington's win against Salford began a run of four consecutive away games with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLiHwe3A25b/?img_index=1\">work under way on their pitch<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> at the Halliwell Jones Stadium.</p><p>Other clubs who groundshare with other sports, like St Helens, Salford, Huddersfield and Hull FC, have similar challenges fitting their home games around when their stadiums are in use or having essential maintenance.</p><p>Changes can be made at relatively short notice during the season, with Huddersfield <a href=\"https://www.giantsrl.com/article/9319/three-games-to-move-date\">announcing on Tuesday<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> that three of their upcoming games would move dates due to stadium availability at the Accu Stadium, which they share with football team Huddersfield Town.</p><p>Meanwhile, Leeds cannot play at Headingley, which adjoins the cricket ground of the same name, if there is an England Test match or a Yorkshire T20 Blast game taking place on the same day.</p><p>In a statement issued to BBC Sport, the RFL said: \"The development of the fixture list is a complex and time intensive project by several people, as well as a leading software programme.</p><p>\"A competition of 12 teams, with a season length of 27 rounds, to include loop fixtures and over 100 requests from the clubs, means it will never be perfect but every attempt is made to ensure it is the best version it can be.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"image-block\"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"><img alt=\"Tesi Niu of Leigh is tackled by Nick Cotric of Catalans\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1920/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2a87/live/be500910-5b21-11f0-9b28-9bfb5df7c94a.jpg 976w\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></picture></span><span role=\"text\"><span>Image source, </span>SWPix</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Catalans have faced Leigh three times this season -

To get over the line and do it, in true Rory fashion keeping us on the edge of our seats until the very end … It was destiny for Rory to join that exalted company. I was very proud just watching it. If I gave a 0.0001% help in his journey then brilliant but it was more pride, knowing him as I do. It isn’t often you will watch something and feel like you are watching your own two boys play.”</p><p>Clarke has never claimed any credit for McIlroy’s achievements. That will not change. McKibbin and Shane Lowry also had involvement with Clarke’s foundation. “I was just trying to help,” he says. “I don’t seek publicity for it because that isn’t why I do it. Half of my foundation is to support breast cancer research [his first wife, Heather, died of the disease in 2006], half is to help the development of junior golf in Ireland, so that is all close to my heart.”</p><p>The 56-year-old recalls not only that 1999 meeting but the early buzz around McIlroy. “I am not saying this to be all ‘I told you so’ but you could see back then how good he was, how much potential he had,” Clarke says. “Now, potential and turning into the player that he has become are two different things but the talent he showed even from that age was just incredible. He was gifted, totally gifted.”</p><p>All evidence suggests McIlroy has rediscovered his mojo after a brief post-Masters lull. Clarke knows the scenario; his life was hugely altered by lifting the Claret Jug in 2011. “I’m not in any shape or form comparing what I did with Rory but when you search and go for so long trying to achieve your goals, sometimes it is hard to have a reset afterwards,” Clarke says. “He has achieved what only five other people in the history of our game have, so it’s no wonder there is a reset for him. The reception he will get at Portrush will be unbelievable.”</p><figure id=\"af7417de-c005-4d73-827d-f33c6a149ead\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74be2e20f6863bcb1773ebd6ab0feaed9162f27/0_0_4020_2636/master/4020.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74be2e20f6863bcb1773ebd6ab0feaed9162f27/0_0_4020_2636/master/4020.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74be2e20f6863bcb1773ebd6ab0feaed9162f27/0_0_4020_2636/master/4020.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74be2e20f6863bcb1773ebd6ab0feaed9162f27/0_0_4020_2636/master/4020.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74be2e20f6863bcb1773ebd6ab0feaed9162f27/0_0_4020_2636/master/4020.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74be2e20f6863bcb1773ebd6ab0feaed9162f27/0_0_4020_2636/master/4020.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Darren Clarke holds the Claret Jug after winning the 2011 Open at Royal St George’s in Sandwich, Kent\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74be2e20f6863bcb1773ebd6ab0feaed9162f27/0_0_4020_2636/master/4020.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"291.7960199004975\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Darren Clarke holds the Claret Jug after winning the 2011 Open at Royal St George’s in Sandwich, Kent.</span> Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Clarke’s own situation is fascinating on two fronts. He was on course to make the cut in 2019 before a nightmarish triple-bogey seven on his 36th hole. Clarke returns to the Dunluce Links, where the 9th hole has been named after him, knowing this could be his final Open. Motivation stems in part from events of six years ago.</p><p>“I was fuming,” he admits. “All my years of experience and to do that on the last hole … I had played so nicely. It wasn’t steam coming out of my ears, it was lava. The ‘new me’ as I get older? Bollocks to that! That irritated me a lot. It hurt me. I have never played tournaments just to make that cut but I was comfortably inside the line and to do that was beyond frustrating.”</p><p>Clarke is undecided on whether this Open will mean goodbye. He remains not only hugely competitive on the Champions Tour in the US but a prodigious worker. “I had gone through a spell of missing the Open cut too many times in a row but last year I actually played OK without having a great weekend. This year I have been playing really nicely without putting well. So I will see, I don’t know. I really haven’t made my mind up. If it gets to the stage where I think I have no chance of having a semi decent week, of making the cut, then I definitely won’t play.</p><p>“I love Portrush, that goes without saying. It is just a very special place for me. If this is to be my last one, there isn’t a better place. I am determined to really enjoy this one. Sometimes, I have tried so hard that I haven’t been able to enjoy where I am.”</p><p>Clarke was a staunch advocate of the Open’s return to Portrush after a 68-year hiatus. Peter Dawson, the former chief executive of the R&amp;A, took on the case.</p><p>“I kept chirping at Peter’s ear,” Clarke says. “I think he ended up trying to avoid me at all costs. It was a bold move on his behalf to commit to bringing the Open to Portrush. It was great the last time; this one will be even better. They could easily just have come back for one but they didn’t, they committed.”</p><figure id=\"e418b8bd-dad6-489a-97c8-4e87ed55c18b\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Darren Clarke tees off at the 1st to start day one of 2019 Open at Royal Portrush\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588245aa7cf0deadbb108c4220cc1ccea5567c85/0_0_3500_2321/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"295.0985714285714\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Darren Clarke tees off at the 1st to start day one of 2019 Open at Royal Portrush.

He comprehends what it means for Northern Ireland to showcase itself now on a global sporting stage. “Bombs and shootings became part and parcel of life,” Clarke says. “You were always wary. I think playing golf and playing in tournaments all over Ireland from a young age got me thinking there was more going on, about what was happening back home not making any sense. We have come an awful long way from that.</p><p>“That’s not at all to say other places in the world haven’t had bad times but you grew up in a tough time. I was fortunate my parents gave me everything to allow me to play golf, which in turn let me see what opportunity was possible back in those days.”</p><p>The final words, and intriguing ones, are for McKibbin. “I have spent a lot of time with Tom, we have the same coach,” Clarke says. “He is the real deal. He just flushes the ball. He is eager, he wants to learn so much.” It feels sensible to take note.</p></div></div>"

I did not want to move to Scotland on my own,” said De Man.</p><p>It’s not too much of a stretch to say that legendary Italian midfielders Sandro Mazzola and his father, Valentino Mazzola, were both <em><a href=\"https://learning.coachesvoice.com/cv/what-is-a-mezzala-explained-de-bruyne-di-maria-pogba/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">mezzalas</a></em>. Valentino is regarded by some as the best Italian player of all time. Captain of the <em>Azzurri</em> and Torino – and the symbol of the <em>Grande Torino</em> side that dominated Serie A in the late 1940s, Valentino died at 30 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/30/newsstory.sport3\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the Superga air disaster</a> in 1949. His son, Sandro was a one-club man with Inter and was a key part of the <em>Grande Internazionale</em> team that seemed unbeatable in the 1960s.</p><p>The story of how Sandro signed with Inter is directly linked to his father’s death. “One day Benito Lorenzi, the Inter forward who played with my father in the Italy team and was a very close friend of his, came to my house,” Sandro told <em>Gazzetta Dello Sport</em>. “He asked my mother to let me go to Milan to become the team’s mascot. Giuseppe Meazza was also greatly affected by the Superga disaster and went out of his way to help my brother and me. The two of us would put on the full Inter kit, walk out with the players and stay by the side of the pitch during the matches. Even as mascots we were on bonuses and we used to get 10,000 lire for a win and 5,000 for a draw. It was a lot of money for our family.” The gesture later convinced Sandro that Inter were the team for him. With nearly 500 club appearances for the <em>Nerazzurri</em> between 1963-74, Sandro – known as ‘<em>Il Baffo</em>’ owing to his trademark moustache – was an attacking creative midfielder linking the wingers and forwards and played in three World Cups for Italy, won the 1968 European Championship and finished second in the 1971 Ballon d’Or rankings.</p><p>Dave Adams reminds us of former Portsmouth attacker John Utaka, the club’s record signing when he joined from Rennes in July 2007 for £7m. The striker did little to justify <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/10/portsmouth-wages-waste-of-money\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">his £80,000-a-week salary</a>, which was a huge burden for a debt-ridden club that was threatened with administration and placed under a transfer embargo.</p><p>“Lennart Wing, the great Swedish wing-half as an obvious starting point alongside the Wycombe full-back Fin Back (who gets extra points for his initials matching his role),” suggests Richard Wilson. “A far less obvious player would be Vuk Strikovic, who nominative determinism of course demands that he play up front.

In Greek the syllables ‘-akis’ are an endearing way of saying a name and it has the meaning of ‘small’, like ‘-inho’ does in Portuguese, with which I assume more people are familiar with. For example, Giorgos, becomes Giorgakis, and is usually a name that’s used for kids named Giorgos. Similarly, Giannis would become Giannakis. Now that this is out of the way, the player I wanted to mention is Michalis Bakakis, who plays as a right back (Back-akis, which if you were to translate it would give you something of the sorts of’ ‘small back man’).”</p><figure id=\"fb19e97b-5674-449d-80c8-cbea4d760aa8\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Michalis Bakakis in action for AEK Athens on a lovely sunny day at Celtic Park in 2018.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c49a2f1235e5705780cb6a8e976f934c34bc8c/0_0_6015_4010/master/6015.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Michalis Bakakis in action for AEK Athens on a lovely sunny day at Celtic Park in 2018.</span> Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>“The best I can offer is my team Farnborough, formerly Farnborough Town, having a winger called Phil Wingfield,” emails Matthew Wilkie. “Also playing at Kingstonian, he literally took to the field on the wing.”</p><p>“Michael Wright played at right back for Villa, mainly in the 70s,” writes Glyn Berrington.

Before half-time, he was joined by teammate Jimmy Conlin, who had started the game with a handkerchief tied on his head. City began the second half 0-2 down and with nine men, but in the 50th minute Conlin, plus handkerchief, returned to set up George Dorsett to make it 1-2. That was as good as it got for City, and before long they were reduced to eight men, losing their scorer and Bob Grieve to heat exhaustion.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-18\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-18\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“The ref consulted his linesmen, but they agreed there was no just cause for abandoning the game.

His exit signals the end of an era -- and ushers in one of the most pivotal seasons in program history, with Oklahoma still trying to find its footing in the SEC.</p><p>Over three years with Venables at the helm, the Sooners are just 22-17 overall and a pedestrian 12-14 in conference play. Their SEC debut in 2024 yielded only two league wins -- tying for their lowest conference win total in nearly nine decades.</p><p>Offensively, it was a disaster. Oklahoma ranked 97th nationally in scoring (24.0 ppg.), 124th in yards per play (4.81) and 114th in success rate (38.8%). Venables fired offensive coordinator Seth Littrell midseason, and highly touted quarterback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125321/jackson-arnold/\">Jackson Arnold</a> was benched after just four games. He was later reinstated as the starter, but ultimately transferred to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> at the end of the season.</p>\n        \n\n<p>The Sooners retooled by hiring offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle, a rising assistant from <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASHST/washington-state-cougars/\">Washington State</a>, and bringing in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915380/john-mateer/\">John Mateer</a> -- a transfer quarterback who followed Arbuckle from Pullman to Norman. Early comparisons to Baker Mayfield may be premature, but Mateer's familiarity with the system gives him a head start in a quarterback room that desperately needs a spark.</p><p>If Venables can't engineer a turnaround in 2025, the Sooners' next athletic director may have no choice but to make the biggest call of all -- hiring a new football coach.</p><h2>Gundy hits reset after Cowboys' collapse</h2><p>In Stillwater, Mike Gundy enters his 21st season as Oklahoma State's coach under an uncharacteristic cloud of doubt. The Cowboys went 3-9 in 2024, failed to win a single Big 12 game and posted their worst winning percentage since 1991. The collapse snapped a run of 18 consecutive bowl appearances and led to serious discussions about Gundy's job status last winter.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Rather than part ways, Oklahoma State restructured Gundy's contract -- but not without reported ultimatums, including a pay cut or dismissal for cause. In response, Gundy made the most significant staff changes of his tenure, firing both coordinators after a humiliating 52-0 loss to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/COLO/colorado-buffaloes/\">Colorado</a> in the season finale.</p><p>The defense was historically bad, finishing 126th in scoring defense (35.6 ppg.), 129th in yards allowed per play (6.81) and 103rd in success rate (55.6%). The offense wasn't much better, cycling through three quarterbacks with limited success. Entering 2025, there is still no clear-cut starter and almost no meaningful experience in the quarterback room with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122497/zane-flores/\">Zane Flores</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a> transfer Hauss Hejney still battling.</p><p>Beyond the staff overhaul, Oklahoma State took an aggressive leap in the transfer portal, adding 41 newcomers -- tied for the third-most among Power Four programs. Only four starters return from last year's team, and the Cowboys' last three high school recruiting classes ranked 10th or worse in the Big 12 and outside the top 50 nationally.</p>\n        \n\n<p>It's a dramatic reset and a high-risk, high-reward strategy for a program trying to keep pace in a rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive Big 12.</p><h2>Sooners or Pokes: Who's more likely to bounce back in 2025?</h2><p>Oddsmakers aren't optimistic. <a href=\"https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/ncaaf?tab=win-totals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a> lists Oklahoma's projected win total at 6.5, while Oklahoma State's sits at 5.5 -- a clear sign that expectations remain modest for both programs after dismal seasons.</p><p>So who's best positioned to rebound?</p><p>On paper, the edge goes to Oklahoma. The Sooners return 12 starters (six on each side of the ball), and despite recent struggles, their overall talent level still outpaces most of the Big 12 and some of the SEC's middle class. The challenge? Surviving the conference gauntlet.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>OKLAHOMA 2025 SCHEDULE</strong></p><table data-title=\"13x2 Table\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Date</p></td><td><p>Opponent</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Aug. 30</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILST/illinois-state-redbirds/\">Illinois State</a> (FCS)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Sep. 6</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Sep. 13</p></td><td><p>at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEMPLE/temple-owls/\">Temple</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Sep. 20</p></td><td><p>Auburn</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Oct. 4</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/KENTST/kent-state-golden-flashes/\">Kent State</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Oct. 11</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> (Dallas)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Oct. 18</p></td><td><p>at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Oct. 25</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Nov. 1</p></td><td><p>at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, No. 15</p></td><td><p>at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Nov. 22</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sat, Nov. 29</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oklahoma could realistically be 3-2 heading into the Red River Rivalry against Texas in Week 7. The more likely scenario? A one-loss start if they manage to split early tilts against Michigan and Auburn. That Auburn game will carry extra spice, with Arnold returning to Norman looking to prove Oklahoma gave up on him too soon.</p><p>The Sooners draw just three SEC teams with worse title odds than themselves: Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee. All three matchups are winnable but could just as easily go the other way.</p><p>For Oklahoma State, the bar is even lower.

Gundy has built a career on exceeding expectations when no one sees it coming. The Cowboys were picked seventh in the 2023 Big 12 preseason poll and made the title game. They were picked fourth in 2021 and came within inches (literally) of winning the conference and punching a ticket to the College Football Playoff.</p><p>No official Big 12 preseason poll was be released for 2025, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/2025-big-12-football-preseason-poll-247sports-expert-panel-picks-arizona-state-to-repeat-as-league-champions/\" target=\"_blank\">but 247Sports compiled a composite projection based on feedback from Big 12 team site reporters</a></span>.

But just imagine for a second if such a team could exist. Would they ever lose a game, much less yield a single point? While we'll never know for sure, it's hard to fathom any other team from any other era defeating a roster filled with the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> best players from 2000-25 and quarterbacked by Tom Brady, who is largely considered to be the greatest of all-time.&nbsp;</p><p>What truly makes this roster stand out is when you consider the many greats that weren't able to make the cut. That list of players was so great that an Honorable Mention was created so that those players could receive some level of recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>When creating the list, it came down to picking the players who made the most impact over the past quarter century. Only the best of the best made the cut.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>** Denotes players currently in the Pro Football Hall of Fame&nbsp;</p><h2>Offense&nbsp;</h2><p><strong><em>Honorable mentions</em></strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a> (QB)<br></li><li>Drew Brees (QB)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/493043/ben-roethlisberger/\">Ben Roethlisberger</a> (QB)&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/411568/frank-gore/\">Frank Gore</a> (RB)<br></li><li>Edgerrin James (RB)**&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272852/antonio-brown/\">Antonio Brown</a> (WR)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1623794/julio-jones/\">Julio Jones</a> (WR)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/396134/jason-witten/\">Jason Witten</a> (TE)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/396811/antonio-gates/\">Antonio Gates</a> (TE)**</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1273188/maurkice-pouncey/\">Maurkice Pouncey</a> (C)&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1107211/jahri-evans/\">Jahri Evans</a> (G)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/563064/marshal-yanda/\">Marshal Yanda</a> (G)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/493695/jason-peters/\">Jason Peters</a> (T)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1631899/tyron-smith/\">Tyron Smith</a> (T)</li></ul><h2><strong><em>Quarterbacks (3)&nbsp;</em></strong></h2><p><em><strong>Starter</strong></em></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187741/tom-brady/\">Tom Brady</a><br></li></ul><p><strong><em>Reserves&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/12531/peyton-manning/\">Peyton Manning</a>**<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a>&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>The inclusions of Brady and Manning on this list were obviously no-brainers. Brady, the 199th overall pick in the first draft conducted in the 21st century, enjoyed an unparalleled career that included seven <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> wins, five <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> MVP awards and three league MVPs. Brady is also first all-time in career passing yards and touchdown passes. Part of his legend is his longevity; he won three Super Bowls in his twenties, two in his thirties and his final two after turning 40.&nbsp;</p><p>Brady is largely considered the \"GOAT,\" but Manning also belongs in any conversation discussing the Mount Rushmore of quarterbacks. No one has won more league MVPs than Manning's five. He is also the first starting quarterback to win Super Bowls with multiple teams. He was at the peak of his powers when the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a> won <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> XL. Nine years later, despite his obvious physical decline, Manning still had enough left in the tank to help lead the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> to a title. Both of those titles came at the expense of Brady, who was just 1-3 against Manning-led teams in conference championship games.&nbsp;</p><p>The third quarterback spot came down to Mahomes and Rodgers. Really, it came down to Mahomes' having three <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> wins to Rodgers' one, along with the fact that Mahomes has played in four more Super Bowls than Rodgers. Both quarterbacks are generational talents who also belong in any Mount Rushmore conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Running backs (3)&nbsp;</h2><p><strong><em>Starter</em></strong></p><ul><li>LaDainian Tomlinson**&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong><em>Reserves&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/517568/adrian-peterson/\">Adrian Peterson</a>&nbsp;<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061188/derrick-henry/\">Derrick Henry</a>&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>As far as running backs are concerned, it doesn't get much better than this trio, starting with Tomlinson, the godfather of <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/fantasy/football/\">fantasy football</a>. Tomlinson, whose career started around the time <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/fantasy/football/\">fantasy football</a> started to take off, piled up yards and touchdowns at a frenzied pace. During his prime, Tomlinson averaged 1,827 total yards and 18 touchdowns. He was the second running back to catch at least 100 passes in a season. His 31 total touchdowns in 2006 is an <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> record. His 145 career rushing touchdowns is No. 2 all-time.&nbsp;</p><p>While not as versatile as Tomlinson, Peterson was just as dominant during his prime. He won three rushing titles during his career and in 2012 won league MVP (the last RB to win the award) after rushing for 2,097 yards, the second-highest single season total in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history. Peterson is fifth on the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> all-time career rushing list.&nbsp;</p><p>While running has taken a backseat in today's <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>, the league nonetheless had some elite backs over the past 25 years. Frank Gore -- who is No. 3 on the career rushing list -- didn't make the cut, along with former <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a> bulldozer <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/504639/marshawn-lynch/\">Marshawn Lynch</a> and former <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> playmaker <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1243187/lesean-mccoy/\">LeSean McCoy</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>It was tough excluding Gore, but Henry is more than deserving of his spot on the list. The current Baltimore Raven is the first player with three seasons of at least 1,500 yards and 15 touchdowns. He ran for over 2,000 yards in 2020, and his 1,921 yards last year is the most ever for a player over the age of 30. Henry's future spot in Canton, Ohio is already secure.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fullback (1)&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1683145/kyle-juszczyk/\">Kyle Juszczyk</a>&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Juszczyk has kept the fullback position alive while showcasing the reasons why it can still add value to an offense. A Pro Bowler each of the past nine years, Juszczyk has been a valuable contributor on two NFC champion teams in San Francisco. Along with being an excellent blocker, Juszczyk can virtually play any skill position.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img alt=\"randy-moss-hall-of-fame.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2019/08/07/3661e66e-33df-4a47-a734-f757359d1805/resize/670x377/b1534a9d2530fe347ee0d906a78745b4/randy-moss-hall-of-fame.png\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"377\" width=\"670\"></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    USATSI\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><h2>Receivers (6)&nbsp;</h2><p><strong><em>Starters&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li>Randy Moss**<br></li><li>Marvin Harrison**<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/492934/larry-fitzgerald/\">Larry Fitzgerald</a><br></li></ul><p><strong><em>Reserves&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li>Terrell Owens**<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/502629/calvin-johnson/\">Calvin Johnson</a>**<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/396162/andre-johnson/\">Andre Johnson</a>**<br></li></ul><p>It was hard to make this list as a running back, but even harder to make it as a receiver. Moss and Calvin Johnson were first-ballot Hall of Famers, while Harrison inexplicably wasn't despite being one of the most productive players the game has ever seen. Owens was a first-ballot talent, but his less than stellar relationship with the media led to him waiting a few years before he rightfully got his gold jacket and bronze bust.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>The greatest offensive player in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> history, Andre Johnson was recently chosen for the Hall of Fame ahead of several of his deserving contemporaries that includes Torry Holt, Hines Ward, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/235157/steve-smith/\">Steve Smith</a> Sr. and Reggie Wayne. Many feel that Moss is the only receiver that comes close to challenging Rice as the greatest to ever play the position. Moss was an absolute nightmare for opposing defenses but a dream for quarterbacks who had the privilege of playing with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Moss, Calvin Johnson (appropriately nicknamed \"Megatron\") possessed otherworldly talent that led to him breaking Rice's <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> record for receiving yards in a single season in 2012 and eventually becoming the second-youngest player ever inducted into the Hall of Fame. Fitzgerald, the longtime <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a> great who nearly willed the franchise to their first title back in 2008, will join the fellow receivers on this list in the Hall of Fame as soon as he is eligible in 2026.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Offensive line (9)&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Starters</em></strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2130188/joe-thomas/\">Joe Thomas</a> (LT)**<br></li><li>Alan Faneca (LG)**<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1245858/jason-kelce/\">Jason Kelce</a> (C)&nbsp;<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1691613/zack-martin/\">Zack Martin</a> (RG)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700429/lane-johnson/\">Lane Johnson</a> (RT)<br></li></ul><p><strong><em>Reserves&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li>Kevin Mawae (C)**<br></li><li>Jonathan Ogden (T)**<br></li><li>Steve Hutchinson (G)**<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1123699/trent-williams/\">Trent Williams</a> (T)&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Often the most overlooked players on the field, these offensive linemen get their just due on this list. Of the nine linemen selected, five already have gold jackets, and the other four undoubtedly will whenever they are eligible.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>In the starting lineup, you have arguably the greatest left tackle in history in Thomas, who played in a record 10,363 consecutive snaps during his 11-year career with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a>. Johnson, the other tackle, was named to his sixth Pro Bowl last year after helping <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> break Terrell Davis' record for the most total rushing yards (regular and postseason) in a single season.&nbsp;</p><p>The starting center position is manned by Kelce, a first-team All-Pro in four of his final five seasons with the Eagles. Speaking of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/AFC/afc-allpros/\">All-Pros</a>, Martin's seven All-Pro nods is the most by any offensive player in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> history. Faneca, the other starting guard, was a six-time All-Pro whose crushing block in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> XL helped spring Willie Parker for a 75-yard touchdown run, the longest run in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> history.&nbsp;</p><p>Our list of reserve linemen are pretty formidable, too. The only non-Hall of Famer of the bunch is Williams, who will undoubtedly get inducted at some point after his career is over. The soon-to-be 37-year-old Williams seemingly gets better with age; he's tabbed as a first-team All-Pro each of the last three years.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<figure><p><img alt=\"tony-gonzalez.jpg\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2016/09/02/51fdfa1e-4f42-47dd-b100-9f5c681c5da4/resize/670x377/ad8312fb96272e8fd70a2a1ad2c79cac/tony-gonzalez.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"377\" width=\"670\"></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    USATSI\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><h2>Tight ends (3)&nbsp;</h2><p><strong><em>Starter&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li>Tony Gonzalez**<br></li></ul><p><strong><em>Reserves&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1725130/travis-kelce/\">Travis Kelce</a>&nbsp;<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1244303/rob-gronkowski/\">Rob Gronkowski</a>&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Gonzalez helped break the tie between Kelce and Gronkowski, whose careers are nearly identical in terms of success, production and the impact both had on their teams. The Kelce-Gronkowski debate is compelling, but it's safe to say that both take a backseat to Gonzalez, the all-time leader at the position in terms of Pro Bowls (14), All-Pros (11), receptions (1,327), yards (15,127) and is second in touchdown receptions (111).&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> win was the one thing missing from Gonzalez's glittering career. That wasn't been the case for the other two tight ends on our list. Kelce has won three Super Bowls while being a key cog in Kansas City's dynasty. Gronkowski won four Super Bowls; three with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> and a fourth after reuniting with Brady in Tampa Bay.

A five-time All-Pro, the menacing Watt led the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>&nbsp;in sacks twice and tackles for loss on three occasions. Donald took the baton from fellow former DPOY winner Sapp as the greatest defensive tackle in the game. The über athletic Taylor won DPOY honors in 2006 after filling the stat sheet with 13.5 sacks, nine forced fumbles and two interception returns for scores. His six career fumble returns for scores is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>&nbsp;record.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Our formidable list of reserves includes Seymour, whose pressure of Kurt Warner set up Ty Law's big pick-six in the Patriots' historic upset of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>&nbsp;XXXVI. Ngata, a key member of the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a>' second Super Bowl-winning team, largely made the cut based on his versatility and ability to play nose tackle. Strahan made the cut largely because of his historic 2001 season that saw him record a league single season record 21.5 sacks. Garrett (the 2023 DPOY winner) made it because of his pass rushing prowess along with his ability to move around the line of scrimmage.&nbsp;</p><h2>Linebackers (9)&nbsp;</h2><p><strong><em>Starters&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071793/t-j-watt/\">T.J.

For our starters, we've got two all-time sack machines at OLB in Watt (who tied Strahan's single-game sack record during his DPOY season in 2021) and Ware, who starred for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a>&nbsp;for over a decade before partnering up with Miller to help the Broncos capture&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>&nbsp;50. At inside linebacker, we've got two players who were the cornerstones to two iconic defenses. Lewis won&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>&nbsp;MVP following the Ravens blowout win over the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a>. Brooks capped off the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a>'&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>&nbsp;win over the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a>&nbsp;two years later with his 44-yard pick-six.&nbsp;</p><p>Miller (the MVP of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>&nbsp;50) is part of an accomplished group of players who made the cut as reserves. At 34, Mack is still going strong after he was selected to his ninth Pro Bowl last year. Urlacher was the face of a formidable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a>&nbsp;defense that played in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>. Kuechly carved out a Hall of Fame worthy career (he won DROY and DPOY) despite playing only eight years.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>By far, the toughest decision during the making of this roster was picking Wagner over Willis, a Hall of Famer who made five All-Pros and seven Pro Bowls during his eight-year career. Ultimately, Wagner's longevity and impact on the Super Bowl-winning Seahawks' defense gave him the nod.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cornerbacks (4)&nbsp;</h2><p><strong><em>Starters&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li>Charles Woodson**<br></li><li>Darrelle Revis**&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong><em>Reserves&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li>Champ Bailey**<br></li><li>Ronde Barber**<br></li></ul><p>This may have been the hardest position to make when you consider that one Hall of Famer (Law) and two possible future Hall of Famers (Peterson and Sherman) had to settle for honorable mention. As good as those players were, they weren't able to top the careers of the four corners who ultimately did make the cut.&nbsp;</p><p>Woodson, the 2009 DPOY, is tied for fifth on the career list with 65 interceptions. Revis was so good that he had an island named after him. Surprisingly, Revis never won DPOY despite being considered the best cornerback in the game for a good portion of his career.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Bailey, a 12-time Pro Bowler, broke up an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>&nbsp;record 203 passes in addition to picking off 52 passes. Barber led the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>&nbsp;in picks in 2001, but his most memorable interception took place a year later when he had a 92-yard pick-six that clinched Tampa Bay's win over Philadelphia in the NFC Championship game.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfls-all-quarter-century-defensive-team-legendary-buccaneers-unit-dominates-list/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>NFL's All-Quarter Century Defensive Team: Legendary Buccaneers unit dominates list</p>\n                <p>\n                    Bryan DeArdo                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"NFL's All-Quarter Century Defensive Team: Legendary Buccaneers unit dominates list\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/07/04e2700a-3257-4b73-a123-4285767ad712/thumbnail/270x152/841275ceb2189232bfe6e528f84d8398/nflallquartercenturyteam-defense.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Safety (4)</h2><p><strong><em>Starters</em></strong></p><ul><li>Ed Reed (FS)**<br></li><li>Troy Polamalu (SS)**<br></li></ul><p><strong><em>Reserves&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li>Brian Dawkins (FS)**<br></li><li>John Lynch (FS/SS)**<br></li></ul><p>As far as dynamic duos are concerned, it doesn't get better than what we have at starting safety with Reed and Polamalu. Reed, the 2004 DPOY, is widely considered the greatest free safety in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>&nbsp;history (just ask Peyton Manning and Bill Belichick). Polamalu, the 2010 DPOY, was a Tasmanian devil who made the unbelievable look routine, like his pick-six that lifted the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> past Reed's Ravens in the 2008 AFC Championship game.&nbsp;</p><p>The hard-hitting Dawkins enjoyed an incredibly long career that he capped off with a ninth Pro Bowl selection at the age of 38. Lynch, the fourth member of the Buccaneers' early 2000s defense to make the cut, shined at both safety positions during his Hall of Fame career.&nbsp;</p><h2>Special Teams</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1392/adam-vinatieri/\">Adam Vinatieri</a> (kicker)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187587/shane-lechler/\">Shane Lechler</a> (punter)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1693045/morgan-cox/\">Morgan Cox</a> (long snapper)&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Vinatieri has booted two-game winning kicks in Super Bowls, but his best kicks occurred during the Patriots' win over the Raiders in the 2001 divisional round.

And it's just this kid who's grinning from ear to ear,\" he told BBC Sport.</p><p>That was before he saw him with a club in his hand.</p><p>\"He swung the same way he does now. You're watching him with his little cut down driver or cut down seven wood and he's just never missing the centre of the club face. </p><p>\"Always right on the button, no toe slappers to the left-side of the fairway. Just flush.\"</p><p>O'Callaghan would become both a friend and regular playing partner in the years that followed and recalls being \"flattered\" to be paired alongside McIlroy and another pal, Stephen Crowe, at the North of Ireland Championship in July 2005. </p><p>On the first day of the prestigious competition, a level-par score around the adjacent Valley course meant O'Callaghan had the better of McIlroy by a stroke. Then came the round that changed it all. </p></div><div data-component=\"image-block\"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"><img alt=\"Rory McIlroy\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1680/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/8892/live/f22e3cf0-5e70-11f0-a633-790fe0633fd6.jpg 976w\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945.1216685979142\"></picture></span><span role=\"text\"><span>Image source, </span>BBC Sport</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Rory McIlroy is one of just six men to have won golf's career Grand Slam</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>McIlroy had first played the famous Dunluce links to celebrate his 10th birthday.

An 0-2 pitch to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765812/manny-machado/\">Manny Machado</a> clipped the bottom of the strike zone, but was called a ball by home plate umpire Dan Iassogna. American League catcher <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/\">Cal Raleigh</a> immediately tapped his head, signaling for a challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At Raleigh's sign, a graphic of where the pitch crossed the strike zone appeared on the scoreboard and notified everyone that it was, in fact, a strike. The call was overturned and Machado was called out for looking at the third strike. This added maybe 15 seconds to the game, max.&nbsp;</p><p>The second time was in the fifth inning when Athletics shortstop Jacob Wilson challenged a strike call that was below the zone. It was overturned for a ball. This one in particular was huge: just think of the difference between an 0-2 count and a 1-1 count for a hitter.</p>\n        \n\n<p>In the bottom of the eighth,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> outfielder <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3152105/kyle-stowers/\">Kyle Stowers</a> thought his called strike three should've been a ball. He tapped his head. And the review showed he was wrong and Iassogna got it right. All we lost was another 10ish seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, in the top of the ninth with a tie game, Edwin Díaz challenged a called ball that ended up being strike three to end the inning. This video is a good illustration for anyone who didn't watch the game at how easy the review graphic makes it.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the arguments against the system that I feel like is a Strawman is something like, \"so what are we gonna do, make the players stand around and wait to end an inning and then have a video determine the inning is over?\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Um, yes. It wasn't that big of a deal.&nbsp;</p><p>In all, there were four challenges of different varieties and all showed some of the strategy behind the balls-strikes challenges along with, of course, just how fast the system works.&nbsp;</p><p>When people refer to the this as \"robot umps,\" I feel like there's a negative connotation loaded in that phrase that really shouldn't be there.&nbsp;</p><p>The ABS system is, for those who need more background here, automated ball-strike system. It's a system that allows hitters, pitchers or catchers to challenge balls and strikes. Challenges are capped and they've been doing it in the minor leagues for years. Major League Baseball used it in spring training and my hunch is it'll be implemented for next season (commissioner Rob Manfred already said <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/rob-manfred-says-mlb-will-propose-automated-ball-strike-challenge-system-for-use-at-the-big-league-level/\" target=\"_blank\">he'll propose it for 2026</a></span>).</p>\n        \n\n<p>My response? Good.&nbsp;</p><p>The complaints tend to come from people who don't understand the system and think \"robot umps\" means every single ball-strike call will come via machine. You'll hear people talk about how much they like the \"human element\" and how we don't have to review everything.&nbsp;</p><p>We aren't doing that at all! Watch the above highlights. Check out the rest of the All-Star Game. There's still a human umpire making the calls behind home plate. The challenges are limited and can only be used twice a game by each team.&nbsp;</p><p>The scoreboard even had those listed next to errors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This isn't taking a full minute like replay review can on out/safe calls. This isn't a situation where a manager gets on the phone to see if the team's video person thinks he should challenge a call, then relays his decision to the umpires who then get on the phone with <em>other</em> umpires staring at screens. It's an immediate call from one of the involved parties, as it was with Raleigh, Stowers and Díaz. We can't say there's no delay, but it's only an incredibly small pause that can happen just a few times a game.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Seemingly every time a player gets asked about ABS, they preach about liking the human element in baseball. This system keeps it while giving an option to replace just a few bad calls a game.&nbsp;</p><p>What isn't to like? Mistakes get fixed with very little fuss or delay. Hall of Fame catcher <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/288970/joe-mauer/\">Joe Mauer</a> is all about it and told me as much.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Umpires are human. They miss calls just like we miss plays, so they're out there trying to do their best to make the right call,\" Mauer <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/hall-of-fame-catcher-joe-mauer-talks-abs-and-why-the-current-state-of-framing-is-ruining-the-art/\" target=\"_blank\">told CBS Sports last month</a></span>. \"If we can implement this system and be efficient with it and make the game better, then I'm definitely all for it.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>That's the other thing to consider when talking about the human element. No umpires want game-altering missed calls hanging over their heads. Umpiring is one of those jobs where you only get noticed for the bad stuff. No one wants the spotlight on a missed balls-and-strikes call. They want to get every call correct, but if they fail to get one right in a big spot, there's a mechanism to fix it with ABS. It's basically just a back-up plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only that, but watch that Díaz pitch again. That thing barely clipped the strike zone. By maybe a millimeter. Are you really going to fault an umpire for not seeing that with the naked eye in real time? It was a 99.1 mph fastball. No human can be expected to nail that call 100% of the time. It's just not reasonable to believe this is possible. This pitch was actually the perfect example of what could be very useful in, say, Game 7 of the World Series.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I thought it was great,\" said National League manager Dave Roberts after the game. \"I think that Dan got a lot of the calls right. There was a couple that were overturned. I thought it was great. The fans enjoy it. I thought the players had fun with it. And there's a strategy to it, if it does get to us during the season. But I like it. I think it's good for the game. I'm okay with it.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>The bottom line is that the All-Star Game proved once again how smooth and easy ABS is. It will be good for baseball when it's fully implemented in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Your league just pulled off one of the most exciting All-Star Games ever and the cherry on top was the conclusion. That is, a <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/2025-mlb-all-star-game-score-national-league-wins-on-wild-home-run-derby-style-swing-off-tiebreaker/live/\" target=\"_blank\">home run swing-off between three players from each league</a> took the place of extra innings. It was glorious.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, this isn't how normal baseball games are supposed to end, but the All-Star Game isn't a normal baseball game. It's a showcase meant to be fun for the fans. Quick, what is more fun: Watching teams desperately try to scrape together pitching in extra innings in a meaningless game or seeing three sluggers taking three swings apiece in hopes of hitting the most homers?&nbsp;</p><p>That's an easy answer, as long as you enjoy fun and don't take this game too seriously. And you shouldn't. The All-Star Game is an event that showcases the best players in baseball and is meant to be nothing more than mindless fun.&nbsp;</p><p>The game itself before the swing-off was amazing, too.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/kyle-schwarber-named-mlb-all-star-game-mvp-phillies-slugger-leads-national-league-to-thrilling-swing-off-win/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Kyle Schwarber named MLB All-Star Game MVP: Phillies slugger leads National League to thrilling swing-off win</p>\n                <p>\n                    Mike Axisa                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Kyle Schwarber named MLB All-Star Game MVP: Phillies slugger leads National League to thrilling swing-off win\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/16/129928f7-b675-425e-b87d-b9cf90e908e6/thumbnail/270x152/ad7f984d32ad73996a8405284a5bb6e3/schwarber-getty-2.png\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>The National League jumped on the best pitcher in the world in Tarik Skubal, scoring two runs in the first inning, though two of the hits were lightly struck and well placed. Then we saw a bunch of great pitching and defense for a few innings.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2447476/pete-alonso/\">Pete Alonso</a> hit a home run and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117913/corbin-carroll/\">Corbin Carroll</a> followed to make it back-to-back jacks for the National League. Keep in mind, the Alonso shot was only the third <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a> All-Star Game home run ever.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Remember how <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837434/brent-rooker/\">Brent Rooker</a> was eliminated from the Home Run Derby via a distance tiebreaker that he lost by less than an inch? He slugged a three-run homer in this one. It started an AL comeback that saw the junior circuit come from a 6-0 deficit to tie the game in the ninth.&nbsp;</p><p>That ninth inning, too, was awesome. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2000026/byron-buxton/\">Byron Buxton</a> started things off for the AL with a hustle double with one out and the American League trailing by two. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117472/bobby-witt/\">Bobby Witt</a> Jr. followed with a double. Witt moved to third on an exceptional play by <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044509/matt-olson/\">Matt Olson</a> at first base for the second out and then <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932861/steven-kwan/\">Steven Kwan</a> battled with two strikes to hit a dribbler to third base that was just slow enough to get him through the bag to beat Eugenio Suárez's throw on in impressive effort.&nbsp;</p><p>The AL tied the game. It was awesome.</p><p>But we were only getting started. Then came the first-ever Home Run Derby swing-off tiebreaker.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Rooker, continuing his shot at redemption in a storyline gifted by the baseball gods, clubbed two homers in three swings. The AL had a 3-1 lead when the second hitter for the NL, the hulking <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135243/kyle-schwarber/\">Kyle Schwarber</a>, stepped into the box.&nbsp;</p><p>All three of his swings resulted in home runs. A day earlier, Schwarber told me he doesn't want to be known as a hitter who only hits home runs, even as he embraces the fact that hitting home runs is the best thing he does on the field. He came through here and was named the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/kyle-schwarber-named-mlb-all-star-game-mvp-phillies-slugger-leads-national-league-to-thrilling-swing-off-win/\" target=\"_blank\">MVP of the All-Star Game</a></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>The only thing that wasn't amazing here was that <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821278/jonathan-aranda/\">Jonathan Aranda</a> failed to hit a home run to tie things up for the AL, because that would've brought Alonso to the plate in an attempt to walk off the Derby tiebreaker.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Still, that's just nitpicking.&nbsp;</p><p>To get to see this unfold in person was so much fun. The thousands of fans who remained in the ballpark had an incredible treat. This was the first time something like this had ever happened, first of all. Secondly, it really could have been a dud. We could have seen a few tired players get up there and lay eggs in the box, struggling to a 0-0 tiebreaker which would've drawn national mockery. Instead, the players stepped up, especially Schwarber.&nbsp;</p><p>And, again, the whole game was great.&nbsp;</p><p>Kudos to Major League Baseball. That was one hell of an All-Star Game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Officially, the final score is 6-6 (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/boxscore/MLB_20250715_ALA@NLA/\" target=\"_blank\">box score</a>), with the NL winning in a tiebreaker. </p><p>Schwarber went 3 for 3 in the swing-off to turn a 3-1 deficit into a 4-3 win for the National League. Here are his home run swings: </p>\n<p>This was the first swing-off tiebreaker in All-Star Game history. The rule was implemented in 2022 as a way to save pitchers, but had not been needed until Tuesday. In the swing-off, each team picks three hitters, who then take three swings each. The most homers wins.</p><p>\"Schwarbs, if he touches it, it's 110,\" National League manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"Like I said earlier, he doesn't take much batting practice outside anymore. For him to get out there and see an arm he's never seen before in (tiebreaker pitcher Dino Ebel), use a big part of the field and hit it out and clutch up and hit three homers. The last one bought in a little bit, kept it fair. That speaks to the hitter he is. You've got a guy who can really hit with bat to ball and has huge power. It's fun to watch.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Schwarber, in his third All-Star Game, became only the second All-Star Game MVP in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Phillies</a> history. Outfielder Johnny Callison hit a walk-off three-run home run to win MVP honors in the 1964 All-Star Game at Shea Stadium. Schwarber went 0 for 2 with a walk before the tiebreaker, making him the first non-pitcher to win All-Star Game MVP without getting a hit in the actual game.</p><p>The 32-year-old slugger took a .247/.378/.545 batting line and 30 home runs into the All-Star break for the first-place Phillies. Only <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/\">Cal Raleigh</a> (38), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> (35), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2901324/shohei-ohtani/\">Shohei Ohtani</a> (32), and <span>Eugenio Suárez</span> (31) have more homers than Schwarber. </p>\n        \n\n<p>Tuesday's win was only the second in the last 12 All-Star Games for the National League. </p>\n\n\n        \n            </div>\n\n    </div></div>"

There is no timetable for that process to play, but it could be a topic of discussion when the board of governors meets again -- likely in September.</p><p>Seattle is the most obvious candidate to land an expansion team, but there would almost certainly be other interested cities. Las Vegas is a burgeoning sports hotbed that in recent years added <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nhl/\">NHL</a> and <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> franchises and is on the verge of getting its first <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/teams/\">MLB team</a>.
