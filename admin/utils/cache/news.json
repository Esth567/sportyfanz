      "content": "'We felt like Premier League footballers' - Jones relives 2005 AshesImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Simon Jones took 18 wickets, at an average of 21, in the 2005 AshesTom ReynoldsBBC Sport journalist\"We felt like Premier League footballers. There was a massive crowd and they had turned away 10,000 people. It was obscene the amount of people who wanted to come and watch.\"It was like, 'wow this is something to behold'. I don't think it'll ever happen again.\"It may be 20 years since arguably the most iconic Test series in Ashes history, but former England bowler Simon Jones can still see every moment in his mind's eye.Jones' 20-20 vision is hardly surprising given the bigger picture: 2005 was England's first Ashes series win since 1987. It not only ended an 18-year, eight-series losing run but it was an endless cricketing summer that flipped the Ashes narrative.England teams since that summer have stored that storied series in their psyche somewhere. They enter with a belief that victory is an option again.Jones' story mirrors that big-picture narrative.The 2005 series – relived in a BBC Sport documentary on iPlayer – was the zenith of a career cruelly cut short by injury.Jones took 18 wickets, including a career-best 6-53 at Trent Bridge, despite, appropriately perhaps, only playing three and a half Tests because of an ankle injury.Despite that setback, the former Glamorgan fast bowler remembers the summer as a once-in-a-lifetime blur of front and back-page news and Downing Street garden parties.It all began at a febrile Lord's that was more stag party than traditional tea party.The home of cricket is known for its serenity. Popping champagne corks rather than popping off.But as Jones remembers, 2005 felt different, even before a ball was bowled.\"When we went through that Long Room, and we walked down the stairs and through the pavilion, it erupted,\" he says.\"I remember Kev [Kevin Pietersen] turning around and saying to me: 'What is going on here?'\"It almost shocked us really. Normally it is all the members and they are a bit subdued. A bit staid. A bit posh.\"But people were saying 'take these down' and we were all like, 'OK, here we go'.\"How to win the Ashes: 2005England rocked the Aussies early on - literally and figuratively. Ricky Ponting was hit in the grille in a first innings during which they were dismissed for 190 - but a Glenn McGrath-inspired Australia went on to win that Test comfortably by 239 runs.\"When Steve Harmison hit Ponting, which never happens by the way, nobody went to check on him,\" Jones says.\"The Australians said this was a different team, like a pack of wolves coming in for the kill.\"And it was. We wanted to take them down.\"If 2005 was one of the most iconic series of all times, the second Test at Edgbaston has gone down as one of the best individual matches of any series.Andrew Flintoff was at his imperious best with bat - making 68 and 73 - and ball, claiming seven wickets including an iconic second-innings over during which he dismissed Justin Langer and Ponting. His act of sportsmanship - commiserating with Australia batter Brett Lee when England had scraped to a two-run victory, after Harmison dismissed Michael Kasprowicz - is an image that is etched into Ashes history.Etched into Jones' memory is how Harmison's final wicket saved him from \"getting his P45\" having feared he'd \"dropped the Ashes\" when he spilled Kasprowicz on the boundary earlier in the day.Media caption, When England won by two runs - was this the greatest Test match of all-time?Jones' days in the sun were to come in the third and fourth Tests. England was in full Ashes fever by the third Test at Old Trafford - Jones' tale about 10,000 fans being turned away refers to the final day at Manchester.If 2005 was the zenith of Jones' career overall, his second-innings dismissal of Michael Clarke was the crowning moment.Clarke looked well set on 39 until Jones, having lured the Australian with outswingers on repeat, delivered the perfect inswinger.It's a delivery that has gone down in folklore - both for the iconic sound of off stump being upended, but also for the stump mic recording of Clarke's painful \"oh no\" realisation there was nothing he could do to reverse-engineer Jones' perfect reverse-swing ruse.England didn't win that Old Trafford Test but Clarke's dismissal, and a backs-to-the-wall Australia being forced to bat out for a draw, illustrated a turning of the tide. \"It sounds like music,\" Jones says of the Clarke delivery.\"It's the best noise in cricket. People want the noise that stump made as their ringtone and stuff. I love the fact that people are still playing it now. It's a long time. But people still think it's one of the best balls that has ever been bowled, so it's a really proud moment.\"Media caption, How the 2005 Ashes 'reinvented' Freddie FlintoffEngland and Jones' 2005 stories have a lot of common ground.But there is one key, painful error where they diverge.While England have used that series as the springboard to write a number of famous Ashes victory stories in the 20 years since, for Jones it was a full stop.The Glamorgan fast bowler was injured in the fourth Test at Trent Bridge and never played for his country again.It's a fact that could leave Jones bitter - but it is quite the opposite.There is a touch of the Tennyson - \"tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\" - to Jones when asked if he'd have given up that endless 2005 Ashes summer for a more elongated Test career.\"At the time, I didn't realise that would be my last Test for England,\" said Jones, who played 18 Tests for England.\"It was like going from the penthouse to the outhouse.\"I had the best summer of my life in an England shirt and then to never play again… but I'm a big believer in what will be, will be. It's better to have experienced it. Would you rather play 100 Tests and not have 2005, or would you rather play the 18 you played and have 2005?\"It would be the 18 Tests with 2005 included every day of the week.\"It didn't get better than that.\"More on this story"

      "content": "<p>Brett OkamotoCloseBrett OkamotoESPN Staff WriterBrett Okamoto has reported on mixed martial arts and boxing at ESPN since 2010. He has covered all of the biggest events in combat sports during that time, including in-depth interviews and features with names such as Dana White, Khabib Nurmagomedov, Conor McGregor, Nate Diaz, Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao and Georges St-Pierre. He was also a producer on the 30 for 30 film: \"Chuck and Tito,\" which looked back at the careers and rivalry of Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz. He lives in Las Vegas, and is an avid, below-average golfer in his spare time.Jeff WagenheimJul 20, 2025, 03:00 AM ETFrom a spectacular debut to the bittersweet departure of a fan favorite, UFC 318 was a roller coaster of emotions.In the main event, Max Holloway successfully defended his BMF championship, beating Dustin Poirier. The final bout of their career trilogy brought an end to a series that started 13 years ago. Leading up to the event, Poirier announced that he would be retiring following the fight.In the co-main event, former middleweight title challenger Paulo Costa snapped a two-fight skid, beating Roman Kopylov by unanimous decision. Also on the card, Islam Dulatov made a statement in his UFC debut, knocking out Adam Fugitt in the first round. Dulatov is also a print model for designer brands.Brett Okamoto and Jeff Wagenheim offer their takeaways from UFC 318.Thank you, Dustin PoirierIn my 15 years covering MMA, rarely have I felt compelled to offer a personal \"thank you\" to an athlete upon his or her retirement. It's not that I'm not grateful to all of them. I love watching people chase greatness and break the perceived \"limits\" we place on ourselves and others. That's the most beautiful thing about combat sports. I just don't feel like it's always my place to specifically thank them for their careers as they come to a close.Poirier is different, though. Honestly, he has inspired me in my own life. I remember after he won the interim lightweight title against Max Holloway in Atlanta in 2019, there were tough people on the internet who implied Poirier cared too much about the interim status, saying things like, \"Settle down, you're not even the real champ.\" Poirier didn't care. He fights his own battles in life -- same as the rest of us -- but he never backs down, and he does it publicly, without ever being fake or showy. It's why he has been so beloved in this sport. It's not wins and losses; it's the fight he has in him.I could list my favorite memories of his career, but I don't need to. He may have never officially held the UFC's undisputed championship, but he's as legitimate a champion as any other in my mind. I'm grateful to have had a front-row seat to his journey. -- OkamotoHolloway did exactly what he was chosen to doThis was a night created to celebrate the departing Poirier, but Holloway deserves love, too, for the way he ushered \"The Diamond\" out the door.Some might say Holloway spoiled the party, but I'd counter that by saying he gave Poirier and Poirier's fans exactly what they came for: a fight. Five rounds of give-and-take. No retreat. This battle with Holloway allows Poirier to walk away knowing he has expended everything he had left for the sport.Holloway was perfect for his role in this emotional event. It would have been a shame if the UFC had booked Poirier in a retirement fight against an antagonist trying to diminish him (of which there are several on the roster). This was not an occasion for trash talk or animosity. Holloway tried to get the New Orleans fans to boo him out of respect for Poirier, but what cretin would boo this guy? It was evident to everyone who paid attention this week that Poirier and Holloway had nothing but love for each other. Every bruise on their faces and bodies, every drop of blood shed, all of it was palpable evidence of their shared love for the sport and the people in it who do things the right way.After having his hand raised, to the disappointment of the Smoothie King Center crowd, Holloway said a few words on the microphone but quickly ceded the center of the cage to the man of the hour. That was pure class. This entire trilogy has been class vs. class. MMA needs athletes like these two, and it's good that at least one of them will continue to compete. --WagenheimThe crowd got into it early, thanks to the prelim fightersAs if the fans in New Orleans needed more reason than the retirement fight of Lafayette, Louisiana, native Poirier to get excited, the prelim fighters did their part to rev up the Smoothie King Center.The first six fights of the evening ended by finish, starting with a rise-to-the-occasion performance by women's flyweight Carli Judice, who is from Poirier's hometown and was in just her sixth pro fight. The crowd ate that one up.The next five fights did not even get out of the first round.According to ESPN Research, when the five-fight early prelims ended with five finishes, it was just the second time in UFC history that's happened (along with 2021's UFC 259, which had finishes in its first five fights on a card with six early prelims). The five first-round finishes fell short of the UFC record of seven, which has happened on 10 cards, most recently in 2015 -- in New Orleans, a city famous for second lines but apparently not second rounds. -- Wagenheim</p>"

I am incredibly proud,\" Germany captain Janina Minge said of her side's resilient comeback. \"I have to say, the fans were unbelievable. I don't know if I have ever experienced anything like that. You could see that we are ready for something big.\"The game went to penalties, and Berger got the shootout off to a great start for the Germans by saving from Amel Majri, but they were brought back to level pegging when Sara Daebrtiz struck her spot kick off the crossbar and over the goal.Berger, a cancer survivor who sports a tattoo to cover up a scar from her treatment that says \"All we have is now,\" then fired home from the spot herself before diving to her left to deny Alice Sombath, sending the Germans through to the last four.England face Italy in the other semi-final on Tuesday.\"We know we'd done the hardest thing by opening the scoring against a team reduced to 10 [players]. Penalties are difficult, we know that, and it's a shame for Alice because she's young and learning. You also have to take your hat off to Germany,\" dejected France coach Laurent Bonadei said.</p>"

It was also the sixth time in the past seven games in which Messi has scored two goals.\"The reality is we had five games in the last two weeks, four of which were away. It is a complicated stage, especially because of the travel and the lack of rest between games,\" Miami coach Javier Mascherano said after the match. \"The game against Cincinnati was a reflection of the exhaustion the team carries, but now we have a long week. We will use it to give rest to those who are more tired, and with the expectation to recover a couple players that are injured and add them to the roster.\"The Red Bulls (9-9-6, 33 points) failed to string together consecutive wins at home and lost to Inter Miami for the second time this season. Mascherano's team is in fifth place in the Eastern Conference, six points behind Philadelphia, but have three games in hand due to its participation in the Club World Cup this summer.New York scored its lone goal in the 15th minute when Emil Forsberg lifted a corner kick in front of Miami goalkeeper Rocco Rios Novo's line of sight. Alexander Hack knocked it home for the score despite having defender Federico Redondo draped all over him.Rios Novo made his second start this season for Oscar Ustari, who sat out with an injury.Lionel Messi celebrates with teammates after a Miami goal against the New York Red Bulls.Getty ImagesJordi Alba, who exited the game in the 84th minute with what appeared to be a leg cramp, scored his first goal of the season in MLS league play off a cross from Messi in the 24th minute to tie the score 1-1.Inter Miami took the lead for good in the 27th when Luis Suarez, who assisted on the first goal, sent a ball ahead to Messi, who then directed it quickly to Alba, who crossed it back to Segovia for an easy shot into the back of the net.In the third minute of first-half stoppage time, Redondo advanced the ball into the Red Bulls' box but could not fire off a shot. Segovia, though, surged in and fired a shot off a rebound past Carlos Miguel Coronel for a third goal.Messi followed with goals in the 60th and 75th minutes to seal the outcome, to the delight of the scores of Miami supporters in the stands despite it being a road game.\"No, it's not a surprise [to see the madness that Messi causes] because I have been with him for eight years at Barca and 15 with Argentina,\" Mascherano said. \"Especially in places where he doesn't go with continuity people go crazy. I have seen it in airports, hotels, he generates this everywhere. I don't think it's only because of his football talent, but because of his admiration as an athlete and the way he's transcended football.\"Leo Messi, Michael Jordan, Rafa Nadal, these are people that have transcended the sport. We are very privileged the people that are close and can witness this.\"Messi increased his total goals in MLS games to 18 this season and has contributed on 27 scores. He has 40 goals in MLS since joining the league in the summer of 2023.The Red Bulls mustered nine shots in the match, but they were outshot 8-1 in shots on target.Information from Field Level Media was used in this report.</p>"

Read his archive here and follow him on Twitter: @MarkOgden_.Marcus Rashford is on the verge of a seasonlong loan move to Barcelona after Manchester United gave the green light for the England forward to open talks with the La Liga champions, sources have told ESPN.Rashford, 27, has spent the last two weeks training away from the first-team squad at United after being told by coach Ruben Amorim that he does not feature in Amorim's plans at Old Trafford.A six-month loan to Aston Villa last season failed to develop into a permanent transfer at a pre-agreed fee of £40 million ($53.6m), but sources have said that Rashford has always preferred a move to Barcelona after the possibility of such a transfer emerged in January.And having missed out on top target Nico Williams following the Spain forward's decision to sign a new contract with Athletic Club and Liverpool rebuffing interest in Luis Díaz, Barcelona have now turned to Rashford after United agreed to a loan deal with an option to sign the player permanently.Rashford, who has three years remaining on his £325,000-a-week contract at Old Trafford, has scored 138 goals in 426 games for United since making his debut as an 18-year-old in February 2016.- Transfer rumors, news: Forest want to sign Jadon Sancho</p>\n\n<p>- Man Utd agree deal for Bryan Mbeumo - sources</p>\n\n<p>- Rashford does not deserve Barcelona transfer - SheringhamHe has also helped United to success in the Europa League and two FA Cup and Carabao Cup wins during his time at the club.

      "content": "<p>Jeff KassoufJul 19, 2025, 05:01 PM ETCloseJeff Kassouf covers women's soccer for ESPN, focusing on the USWNT and NWSL. In 2009, he founded The Equalizer, a women's soccer news outlet, and he previously won a Sports Emmy at NBC Sports and Olympics.United States forward Trinity Rodman returned to training with the Washington Spirit on Saturday for the first time in three months.Rodman, who scored three goals at last year's Olympics to help the USWNT win a gold medal, last played a competitive match on April 12 for the Spirit. She has been hampered by a back injury that she has reaggravated several times since the Olympics, limiting her to just one match for the USWNT in the past 11 months.Rodman had been out indefinitely since mid-April and had not participated in team activities with the Spirit in months. She has trained individually in recent weeks.\"It's great to have Trinity back with our team,\" a Spirit spokesperson told ESPN. \"Player health and well-being are always our top priorities, and Trinity has put in a tremendous amount of work to return to training. She's an important part of our team, and we're all looking forward to our first match back in front of our fans on August 3.\"According to ProSoccerWire, Rodman participated in about half of Saturday's training session and stepped aside for individual work when the Spirit shifted to an 11-v-11 game. The training session was open to the public.USWNT head coach Emma Hayes told ESPN in early June that Rodman would return to training with the Spirit at some point in July.\"She's in great spirits, and I know we're moving in the right direction with Trin,\" Hayes said last month. \"Both club and country have been working hard to get her to this stage.\"The NWSL is in the middle of a monthlong break from the regular season due to international competitions. The Spirit have friendly matches scheduled for later this month before returning to regular season play on Aug. 3.Rodman left an NWSL game in a wheelchair last September after injuring her back in a game in Kansas City. She managed the injury through the end of the NWSL season, helping the Spirit finish second in the regular season and runners-up in the NWSL Championship.She continued to struggle with the injury this year. Rodman was left off USWNT rosters for most of the past year to allow her to rest. She was called up for a pair of matches against Brazil in early April and scored 10 minutes into her return to the USWNT. It was her only international appearance since the Olympics to date.A week later, she left the Spirit's NWSL game at halftime. Shortly after that, she went to London to have her back evaluated by doctors.Rodman previously said that she doesn't think her back will ever be 100% again.\"It's kind of an issue of it's not one specific thing, it's just the way that my back's structured,\" she said. \"And it's more so management than like a curable fix.\"I don't think my back will ever be the way it was my rookie year, which is unfortunate,\" she added.Rodman, 23, is one of the NWSL's and USWNT's biggest stars. She is an impending free agent and became eligible to start negotiating with other teams on July 1. She told ESPN earlier this year that it is \"just a matter of when\" she decides to play in Europe.Spirit owner Michele Kang has said several times that the team will \"do everything we can\" to re-sign Rodman.</p>"

The noise was booming, some of the loudest chants of the night. A small grin spread across Collier's face.The fans echoed the message players sent during warmups Saturday night when they wore black shirts that read \"Pay Us What You Owe Us.\" The collective demonstration occurred two days after more than 40 players met with the league in the latest round of collective bargaining agreement negotiations. The players didn't think the meeting produced enough progress with a late October deadline looming.So as a national audience tuned into one of the most highly anticipated WNBA All-Star games to date, the players put a spotlight on their behind-the-scenes fight to secure higher salaries and a larger piece of the revenue.\"That was a powerful moment,\" Los Angeles Sparks guard Kelsey Plum said of the crowd's support. \"We didn't, at least as players, we didn't know that was going to happen. So it was a genuine surprise. Those chants tonight, those signs, it just shows that as players, we are united, but the fans are united in believing what we're seeking.\"\"The fans making that chant,\" Collier added, \"that gave me chills.\"Knowing they wanted to make a statement Saturday night, the players gathered for a closed-door meeting in the morning and decided that wearing shirts would send their message in a clear, concise way.\"We wanted to do something that was united as a collective, and I thought that it's a very powerful moment and got the point across,\" Plum said. \"Sometimes, you don't have to say anything.\"This isn't the first time WNBA players have used their platforms to make a public, collective stand. In the 2020 bubble, they wore several shirts to support the Black Lives Matter protests. In the second half of the 2022 All-Star Game, they wore Brittney Griner jerseys while she was being detained in Russia.Making another statement at this year's All-Star Weekend wasn't by accident. It's the only time of year when all of the league's most prominent players are gathered. On the heels of Thursday's CBA negotiations, the players believed the moment couldn't have been better.The display overshadowed an otherwise boring All-Star Game. With the support of onlookers in the arena and from afar, the players hope it will apply more pressure on the league as talks continue.\"The mission was accomplished because we built an incredible amount of awareness this weekend,\" Plum said.Players have said a major holdup in negotiations has been the salary structure and revenue sharing. According to WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike, the league and union are proposing two systems, with the league wanting a fixed percentage and the players wanting \"a better share where our salaries grow with the business, and not just a fixed percentage over time.\"With the WNBA seeing tremendous growth in recent years -- including a new $2.2 billion media deal and skyrocketing expansion fees of $250 million -- the players want a salary structure that, in Collier's words, gives them a \"[larger] piece of the pie that we helped create.\"\"We see the growth of the league, and as it stands, the current salary system is not really paying us what we're owed,\" Ogwumike said of the shirt's slogan. \"And we want to be able to have that fair share moving forward, especially as we see all of the investment going in, and we want to be able to have our salaries reflected in a structure that makes sense for us.\"The union announced on social media that officially licensed \"Pay Us What You Owe Us\" shirts are on sale for the public.\"The players are what is building this brand and this league,\" Collier said. \"There is no league without the players, and past, present, the ones coming up, they're the ones that have put in the blood, sweat and tears for the new money that's coming in.\"With the second half of the WNBA season resuming Tuesday -- and the playoff race heating up -- the players will look to build on the momentum from this week.Ogwumike and Engelbert reiterated Saturday that they are optimistic a deal can be done this year.\"That's the plan,\" Ogwumike said. \"We're doing whatever it takes to get a good deal done. That's exactly what we want to do.\""

He was also a producer on the 30 for 30 film: \"Chuck and Tito,\" which looked back at the careers and rivalry of Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz. He lives in Las Vegas, and is an avid, below-average golfer in his spare time.NEW ORLEANS -- Dustin Poirier couldn't secure a win in the final fight of his storied UFC career Saturday -- but ultimately, that mattered very little.Poirier's final walk to the Octagon at UFC 318 inside the Smoothie King Center ended in a unanimous decision loss to former featherweight champion Max Holloway, but it was still a fitting end to his 16-year professional career. The five-round BMF title fight saw several dramatic swings of momentum and culminated in the two meeting in the middle of Holloway's patented point-down exchange.All three judges scored the lightweight bout for Holloway: 49-46, 49-46 and 48-47. Immediately after the win, Holloway (27-8) welcomed all BMF challengers and made a brief reference to 155-pound champion Ilia Topuria before ceding the spotlight to Poirier (30-10).\"It's been overwhelming honestly,\" Poirier said about the amount of fight-week adoration he received. \"I feel appreciated. I feel seen. I never stepped outside of fighting and looked at it this way. I never got to look at it third person. This week has been incredible. I feel loved by the fans, Louisiana and the company. I'm a kid living the dream out here, man, throwing punches.\"Holloway accomplished his goal of playing the spoiler.\"I'm pretty happy,\" Holloway said. Poirier can still hit hard, he said, \"but he kept coming back and back. I came in, and I knew I was going to try and be the spoiler and the villain.\"Poirier, 36, retires in a tie for the fifth-most wins in UFC history with 22. He is also tied for fourth-most knockouts with 11.Poirier's legacy involves three undisputed title appearances in 2019, 2021 and 2024. He came up short in each, against Khabib Nurmagomedov, Charles Oliveira and Islam Makhachev. He captured an interim lightweight title in 2019, though, by defeating Holloway via unanimous decision in an instant five-round classic.Saturday's trilogy against Holloway -- Poirier won the first two meetings -- featured everything the sport came to expect from a Poirier fight. Holloway dropped him with a right hand in the opening minutes, but Poirier survived and scrambled back to his feet. Holloway dropped him again in the second round, but Poirier recovered and actually dropped Holloway later in the frame and shot for a guillotine.Poirier walked out to the Octagon with New Orleans rapper Lil Wayne, in a poetic nod; Poirier, who was born and raised in Lafayette, walked out to Lil Wayne's track \"A Milli\" for his UFC debut in 2011. The UFC rearranged its schedule to book Poirier's final fight in his home state.According to UFC Stats, Holloway, of Hawaii, outlanded Poirier in total strikes 186-114. Poirier cut Holloway under his left eye in the fourth round, but the volume of Holloway's strikes also started to take a toll around that same time. Poirier's movements grew a little sluggish late, although he still had enough to accept Holloway's invitation to stand in the center of the Octagon and swing at the end of the fight.It's a big win for Holloway, who came off the first knockout loss of his career to Topuria in their 145-pound title fight in October. UFC president Dana White said Holloway is \"in a great position right now\" for a potential title rematch with Topuria at 155 pounds.\"He just defends that BMF title. He's ranked No. 4 in the world there,\" White said. \"Anything is possible for Max right now.\"The Associated Press contributed to this report."

He is also an NAACP Image Award-nominated filmmaker as a producer for the animated short film \"Bridges\" in 2024.LAS VEGAS -- More than 24 years after Manny Pacquiao made his stateside debut at the MGM Grand Garden Arena by upsetting Lehlo Ledwaba for the IBF junior featherweight title, the Filipino sensation attempted to make history as the oldest fighter to win the welterweight championship at the same venue where it all started.But Pacquiao, 46, fell short in his attempt when his fight with WBC champion Mario Barrios ended in a majority draw Saturday night. Barrios retained his title as a result, and Pacquiao left Las Vegas empty-handed.\"I thought I won the fight,\" a dejected Pacquiao said. \"It was a close fight. He was very tough.\"Pacquiao was ahead on all three scorecards going into the 10th round. However, all three judges scored the final three rounds for Barrios, allowing him to retain his title. The result -- with two judges scoring it 114-114 and one judge scoring it 115-113 for Barrios -- fell flat in front of a capacity crowd of 13,107, most of whom were Pacquiao fans.Pacquiao (62-8-3, 39 KOs) ended a four-year retirement a month after being inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and started quickly against Barrios, who is 16 years his junior. The early rounds saw a more vintage version of Pacquiao, a far cry from the sluggish version who lost a decision to Yordenis Ugas in 2021. Boxing's only eight-division world champion brought the crowd to life by launching into his trademark offense, darting his left hand between Barrios' gloves and rolling in with combinations.But Father Time appeared to have his way with Pacquiao, as the former senator in the Philippines slowed down by the middle rounds.\"I need to continue my training for longer going into a championship fight,\" said Pacquiao, who announced his return to the ring in May after falling short in his run for senator. \"Because of the election I started late, but it's OK. Of course I'd like a rematch. I want to leave a legacy and make the Filipino people proud.\"Heading into the fight, Barrios (29-2-2, 18 KOs) had only lost to Gervonta Davis and Keith Thurman. However, his past two outings against Abel Ramos (draw) and Fabian Maidana (win) were far from impressive.Barrios was handpicked by Pacquiao for his return fight and was granted a title shot due to the WBC's rules stating that a former champion could request a title fight after coming out of retirement. Pacquiao nearly pulled it off, but Barrios clawed his way back into the fight.\"His stamina is crazy,\" Barrios said. \"He's still strong as hell and his timing is real. He's still a very awkward fighter to try to figure out.\"Pacquiao summoned the energy to fire his combinations but was clearly tiring in the second half as Barrios did just enough to convince the judges, allowing him to retain his title.Pacquiao landed 101 of 577 punches (17.5%) to Barrios' 120 of 658 (18.2%), but Pacquiao managed to outland his opponent 81-75 in power punches.Barrios said he would be interested in sharing the ring with the legend again.\"I'll do the rematch,\" Barrios said. \"Absolutely. This was huge for boxing. I'd love to do it again.\"Considering that Pacquiao said he is looking to fight again, he might get another attempt at making history. Until then, he can take solace in proving he still has it.Said Pacquiao, \"I hope this is an inspiration to boxers that if you have discipline and work hard you can still fight at this age.\""

An FBI complaint unsealed in February, identifying Burrow only as \"Athlete 5,\" listed the total value of items stolen at around $300,000.The pattern of athletes' homes being burglarized while they were publicly scheduled elsewhere includes Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce and NBA stars Luka Doncic of the Los Angeles Lakers and Mike Conley of the Minnesota Timberwolves.The pawn shop owner, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy, 43, of North Bergen, New Jersey, pleaded guilty Friday to one count of conspiracy to receive stolen property in a Brooklyn federal court. He admitted knowingly purchasing stolen property, including high-end watches, jewelry and handbags.Nezhinskiy, whose sentencing date has not been determined, faces a maximum of five years in prison and restitution of approximately $2.5 million and forfeiture of more than $2.5 million. In addition, because he is from the country of Georgia while legally residing in the United States, Nezhinskiy faces federal charges and the possibility of deportation, District Judge William F. Kuntz said.\"This defendant ran a black-market pipeline, buying stolen luxury goods from organized theft crews that targeted homes and businesses,\" New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a statement Friday. \"It was a deliberate operation that helped professional burglars prey on innocent people.\"Co-defendant Juan Villar, 48, who co-managed the pawn shop, pleaded guilty in June to the same charge, the U.S. Attorney's Office said Friday. The two men had worked together since 2020, according to the release, as \"fences\" to receive and buy stolen goods from outside of New York. Villar, of Queens, also is awaiting sentencing.\"For more than five years, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy established a demand for stolen merchandise, which allowed South American Theft Groups to profit from repeated burglaries,\" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia said in a statement. \"His purchases perpetuated a ripple of criminality targeting residences and business across the country.\"The U.S. Attorney's Office said South American theft groups traveled the United States and targeted homes in affluent neighborhoods as well as jewelry vendors. The investigation involving multiple states has resulted in six arrests.Nezhinskiy and Villar weren't charged with specific burglaries. Police searched the pawn shop and storage units owned by Nezhinskiy in New Jersey and found suspected stolen property including sports memorabilia, artwork and fine wine, as well as luxury goods, clothing and \"power tools consistent with those commonly used in burglaries and opening safes,\" according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.Three men arrested in a series of burglaries, including the one of Burrow's home, were indicted in February by a federal grand jury in Cincinnati, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio.Burrow said in the latest season of the Netflix show \"Quarterback\" that was released earlier this month that he canceled the purchase of a replica, fully functioning Batmobile following the burglary of his home.\"I just get very uncomfortable,\" Burrow told the show. \"My life is very public. That comes with the job, but there's certain parts of your life that are yours. Your house is one of those.\"Information from ESPN's Ben Baby and Field Level Media was used in this report."

(1:57)Guard Marcus Smart has agreed to a contract buyout with the Washington Wizards and plans to sign a two-year, $11 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers after clearing waivers, sources told ESPN on Saturday.Smart, the 2022 Defensive Player of the Year and a three-time All-Defense first-team member, will have a player option on his new Lakers deal to enter a more flush 2026 free agency, sources said.Lakers All-NBA star Luka Doncic reached out to Smart and made it clear that he wanted to play with the two-way stalwart, sources said.The planned move serves as a return to a grand stage for Smart, who made the playoffs in each of his first nine NBA seasons with the Boston Celtics. He missed the postseason over the past two years in Memphis and Washington.Smart has also been limited to 54 games over the past two seasons due to injuries, including to his right finger last season, and he averaged a career-low 20 minutes per game in 2024-25.The Lakers, Phoenix Suns and Milwaukee Bucks seriously pursued Smart, who received permission to speak to teams along with his agent, Jason Glushon, and had positive conversations with personnel from all three teams, sources said.

A native of Grapevine, Texas, he graduated from the University of North Texas with a bachelor's degree in journalism. He is an adjunct journalism professor at Southern Methodist University and a member of the Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA).CINCINNATI -- Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Shemar Stewart did not report to training camp with the rest of the team's rookies on Saturday. He is the lone first-round pick in this year's draft class who has not signed his rookie deal.Stewart, the 17th overall pick out of Texas A&M, did not participate in any of the offseason workouts because of a contract dispute over the language that could potentially void the guaranteed money in his deal. Before Saturday, Stewart and linebacker Demetrius Knight, the team's second-round pick, were the only members of Cincinnati's six-person class who had not inked their rookie deals.However, Knight made his deal official on Saturday afternoon ahead of the starting training camp. The difference in the details is notable and shows the gap in Stewart's negotiation. According to a source familiar with the negotiations, the percentage of Knight's signing bonus that was paid up front was not offered to Stewart. Knight's signing bonus is projected at $3.2 million, according to OverTheCap.com. Stewart is projected to receive a signing bonus of $10.4 million.Earlier in the week, Texas A&M coach Mike Elko said on \"SportsCenter\" that Stewart has no intentions of returning to college to play for the Aggies. Under the current collective bargaining agreement between the NFL Players Association and the NFL, the team that drafted a player retains their rights through the following year's draft. Since Stewart declared for the draft after his junior year, he would need to likely sue the NCAA in order to gain his final year of eligibility.Cincinnati's veterans are set to report on Tuesday, one day before the team begins its training camp in downtown Cincinnati."

From lineup changes to minor league call-ups to injuries and so much more, the news cycle will constantly affect player values in fantasy baseball.Our fantasy baseball buzz file, with contributions from our ESPN fantasy writers, aims to provide fantasy managers with the intel they need as news breaks around MLB.Key links:  RP depth chart | Player Rater | Scoring leaders \nSunday's lineup advice | 10-day hitting forecasterJuly 20: What you need to know for SundayTodd Zola: Sunday's first pitch is scheduled for 12:05 p.m. ET with the Toronto Blue Jays hosting the San Francisco Giants, to be quickly followed by the Baltimore Orioles visiting the Tampa Bay Rays. The slate wraps up with the Texas Rangers entertaining the Detroit Tigers at 7:10 p.m. ET in the ESPN Sunday night affair.Nathan Eovaldi was initially scheduled to take the hill in Arlington, but he experienced tightness in his back Saturday and was scratched. Jacob Latz will fill in for the Rangers, with Tarik Skubal getting the nod for the Tigers.Just one day after being activated from the IL after recovering from an oblique issue, Brandon Lowe left Saturday's game with plantar fasciitis in his left foot. With the Orioles starting lefty Trevor Rogers, Lowe was ticketed for the bench to start the game regardless. His availability to come in and face a right-hander is unclear.Isaac Paredes had to leave Saturday's game early after hurting his right hamstring while running to first base following a single to left field. The severity should be clarified by imaging, with his status today in jeopardy.The Arizona Diamondbacks anticipate that Ketel Marte will come off the restricted list in advance of Sunday's home tilt with the St. Louis Cardinals. The club took the first two games of the three-game set while Marte was home attending to personal matters.The Philadelphia Phillies placed Alec Bohm in the 10-day IL with a fractured rib. He was hit by a pitch last weekend and was in the lineup Friday, but after experiencing discomfort, Bohm underwent imaging which revealed the fracture. His timetable is unclear, with Otto Kemp the likely substitute at the hot corner.Steven Kwan missed his second straight game Saturday due to a lingering wrist issue. He injured it last weekend and was able to play in the Midseason Classic, but he was unable to take the field as the Guardians split the first two games of a weekend series with the Athletics.July 19: What you need to know for SaturdayZola: Action gets underway at 3:07 p.m. ET with the San Francisco Giants visiting the Toronto Blue Jays in an interleague affair.Ketel Marte has been placed on the restricted list so he can continue to handle personal matters after his house was robbed during the All-Star break. Blaze Alexander will fill in at second base. In other Arizona Diamondbacks news, Adrian Del Castillo was called up from Triple-A Reno to help cover Pavin Smith being sent to the 10-day IL for a strained oblique. Del Castillo will see most of his action at DH, but he could also slot in behind the plate.The Baltimore Orioles shut down Grayson Rodriguez after he experienced elbow discomfort during rehab. He won't pitch for at least a week. Rodriguez was initially sidelined with a sore elbow, but he then injured his lat, delaying his return. The club hopes Rodriguez can return later in the second half to accrue some innings so his workload will be less restricted next season, but there is no timetable for his 2025 debut.The New York Yankees announced that LHP Max Fried will not start this weekend because of blister issues. The club is hopeful that Fried can return when the Yankees visit the Rogers Centre for a three-game set with the Blue Jays to open next week. In other pitching news, Cam Schlittler was initially ticketed to start Friday night, but he's nursing a sore upper arm. New York anticipates that he'll be able to take the hill in the critical set against Toronto.Steven Kwan was on the bench Friday night when the Cleveland Guardians resumed play after the break. Kwan has been dealing with a right wrist issue, receiving an injection Wednesday. He's considered day-to-day for Saturday night's home date with the Athletics."

Everyone knows this is turning into a procession. The 2023 US Open champion Wyndham Clark hasn’t given up the ghost, mind you: out in 33, he’s subsequently birdied 11, 12 and 14, and has just fired his second at 15 into the heart of the green. He’ll have a long look at birdie from there. He’s currently in the group tied for second at -10 and going very well. Not good news for Portrush carpenters hoping to get a gig repairing lockers next week.A fine end to the week for Canada’s Corey Conners. Back in 30 strokes, and his 66 will guarantee a high finish. He’ll be ruing his underwhelming opening-day round of 74. It’s not quite a DeChambeauesque recovery, but it’s in the ballpark, and they’ve both ended the week at -9. He joins Bryson in the clubhouse lead.Chris Gotterup can’t make his par saver on 11. He slips back to -10. Haotong Li isn’t good for his on 10, either, and drops back to -10 as well. Bogey for Harris English at 11. Everyone’s going backwards … except Scottie Scheffler, who doesn’t make his birdie putt, but his seven-shot lead, recently cut to four, is back to six again in short order. Crisis? What crisis?-16: Scheffler (10)</p>\n\n<p>-10: Gotterup (11), Fitzpatrick (10), Li (10)Scottie Scheffler looks concerned as he wedges into 10. No idea why, because the ball screeches to a halt pin high, 20 feet to the left of the flag, before taking a right-angle and rolling to ten feet. Haotong Li meanwhile, having flayed his tee shot into deep trouble, is forced to chip back out onto the fairway. He sends his third into the heart of the green, but he’ll have a 16 footer for par. And that’s the dilemma that Chris Gotterup is faced with, after sending a flyer over 11 and failing to get his chip back close.Double bogey at 10 for McIlroyRory McIlroy’s race is run. His tee shot at 10 disappears into rough down the left. His second gets a flyer, and airmails the green. So far over that he’s on the wrong side of a bank at the back. He tries to get too cute off a tight lie, and almost whiffs his chip. The ball lands apologetically on the upslope and bounces back down into the bespoke gallery that has formed a horseshoe around him. Second time, he gets the ball onto the green, but he’s a good 20 feet away. Two putts later, and that’s a double-bogey six that drops him back to -8. Any outside chance of a romantic home victory gone in a flash.Haotong Li makes his birdie putt. He’s out in 35. Realistically, he needed something lower. A fact rammed home when Scottie Scheffler tidies up for his birdie. What a way to respond to that double-bogey. He’s out in 34, and his lead is back to five. No signs of concern on his face, just the usual down-to-business look.-16: Scheffler (9)</p>\n\n<p>-11: Gotterup (10), Li (9)</p>\n\n<p>-10: English (10), McIlroy (9), Fitzpatrick (9)Li’s copped a half-decent lie on the bank to the left of 9, but he doesn’t have much green to play with. What a shot he manufactures, though. He stings his wedge into the bank to the left of the green, stunning the ball and kicking it right to six feet! That’s quite outrageous. Over to Scottie, who bounces a wedge from 100 yards to a similar distance. Bounce-back birdie coming up?Scottie settles himself by battering his drive at 9 into the semi-rough down the right. That’ll be fine. Not so Haotong Li, who hoicks his tee shot into deep nonsense. Meanwhile up on 10, Chris Gotterup gets imaginative from the rough at the back of the green. He deliberately knocks his chip long and left of the hole, using the bank at the back to u-turn his ball to six feet. He makes his par putt, and that’s a magical momentum saver. He remains -11, four off Scheffler’s lead.The chasing pack can’t rely on Scheffler offering them more gifts, though. They’ve got to do something themselves … and Rory McIlroy disappoints the gallery by cracking a monster 352-yard drive down 9, then leaving his chip 25 feet short. Two putts later, and what a waste. He remains at -10. Meanwhile Chris Gotterup finds rough at the back of the 10th green, pulling his approach, and the peloton is in danger of taking their collective foot off the pedal just as the leader wobbles for the first time this week.Double bogey at 8 for SchefflerScottie Scheffler can’t make his bogey putt on 8, and that’s his first double bogey of the week. An incredibly daft decision to take a shy at the green from the bunker, and it’s cost him. All of a sudden, his seven-shot lead has been whittled down to four.-15: Scheffler (8)</p>\n\n<p>-11: Gotterup (9)</p>\n\n<p>-10: English (9), McIlroy (8), Fitzpatrick (8), Li (8)The new US Open champion JJ Spaun nearly holes out from 176 yards for eagle on 18. What a sign-off that would have been! It’s a tap-in birdie, and he’s back in 30 strokes, signing for a 68. He doesn’t half like the back nine on a major Sunday! He ends the week at -6.Scheffler fires his wedge straight at the flag. He’s shooting four. He lands 15 feet short of the pin, but he’s got a chance to salvage bogey. Elsewhere, Chris Gotterup birdies 9 to turn in 33, and out of absolutely nowhere, there’s a little bit of jeopardy for the world number one.… and on 8, Scottie Scheffler makes an absurd unforced error. Instead of taking his medicine out of the fairway bunker, he takes a long iron and goes for the green. The face of the bunker is way too steep, and he slams his ball into it. He’s fortunate his ball doesn’t roll back into his deep footprint. Then he does what he should have done in the first instance, wedging out. The leader will do well to avoid double bogey now. Hmm.“Gosh, dang it!” Some wholesome cussin’ from Scottie Scheffler, in response to his third poor tee shot in a row. This one finds a fairway bunker down the right of 8. Perhaps understandably, his levels of intensity have dropped a little. That can’t be said for Matt Fitzpatrick, who has clearly decided to have one last shy at the title. He follows birdie at 7 by firing an arrow straight at the flag on 8. Another birdie, and now he’s -10.From the theatre to the pantomime, as a chorus of highly amused oohs and aahs cascade down from the gallery. They’re the response to Scottie Scheffler knocking an uncharacteristically heavy handed wedge 15 feet past the hole. A first bogey since the 11th on Friday coming up? Nope! In goes the par saver, and this is an almost super-human display of golf. Two huge up and downs yesterday afternoon, at 11 and 14, and the same again today, at 6 and 7. It’s all part of it. Wow.Harris English walks in a 25-footer on 8 to join the pack at -10. Meanwhile Scottie Scheffler takes his medicine out of the fairway bunker at 7 … then pulls his approach from 200 yards down a bank to the left of the green. Another up-and-down test coming up. “Two greens missed in a row, there’s a new stat!” quips the three-time winner Sir Nick Faldo on Sky Sports, his words just about audible over the theatrical hoisting of a large arched eyebrow.Rory McIlroy recovers from his wild drive at 7. And how. He nearly holes out with his wedge from 80 yards, then tidies up for a birdie that raises him to -10. Back on the tee, Scottie Scheffler drives into a bunker. Let’s manage expectations: this is over. But it’s not quite over yet. Rory certainly isn’t giving it up.-17: Scheffler (6)</p>\n\n<p>-10: Gotterup (8), McIlroy (7), Li (6)</p>\n\n<p>-9: DeChambeau (F), English (7), Fitzpatrick (7)Matsuyama in with 66Par for Hideki up the last. Out in 33, back in 33. A fine round, albeit one that unbelievably promised more when he was six-under for it through 12. A slightly diminuendo finish, with bogeys at 13 and 16, but overall he’ll take that. Whether it’s enough for his first top-ten finish at an Open since finishing tied for sixth on debut in 2013 is yet to be seen. It’s in the balance: he’s currently tied for 12th.Birdie for Chris Gotterup at the par-five 7th, and the Scottish Open champion moves to -10. Back down at the tee, Rory McIlroy carves his drive into the thick rubbish down the right of the fairway. And is there a small chink of light for the peloton, as Scottie Scheffler comes up short of the par-three 6th, his ball funnelled into a valley by the false front, his chip back up none too close? Nope! He holes the 16-footer that remains, and punches the air with great determination. Scottie doesn’t care? Oh he cares!-17: Scheffler (6)</p>\n\n<p>-10: Gotterup (7), Li (6)</p>\n\n<p>-9: DeChambeau (F), English (7), McIlroy (6)</p>\n\n<p>-8: Fowler (F), N Højgaard, Schauffele (8), Hatton (8), Fitzpatrick (6)A 64 for Bryson!We have a new clubhouse leader at -9. Bryson DeChambeau sends a forensic second straight at the 18th flag, then rattles in the 12-footer that remains for birdie and a 64. Out in 32, back in 32. He punches the air, arm raised in the triumphant style of John Bender from the Breakfast Club, and soaks up the acclaim. He’s box-office all right! That opening round of 78 so costly. How has he not won a major this year? He’s been outrageously good. Scottie and Rory are the reason he’s not won a major this year. What can you do? Next year, maybe. Don’t you forget about him.Bryson DeChambeau of the United States reacts after his putt on the 18th green. Photograph: APRory McIlroy tries his best to trim that seven-shot lead to six. He knocks his tee shot at the par-three 6th pin high, then nearly drains the birdie putt. But it stays up on the high side, a dimple’s width to the left. The small margins … because seconds later, back on 5, Scottie Scheffler, having laid up from the tee, wedges from 90 yards to 14 feet, then rolls in the birdie putt. Eight clear momentarily … though his partner Haotong Li then follows him in for a birdie of his own to reduce the gap back to just (!) the seven.-17: Scheffler (5)</p>\n\n<p>-10: Li (5)Seven-shot leads, then. If the King can ship one, with nine holes to go at the 1966 US Open, then you can be sure Scottie isn’t taking any liberties just yet.Matt Fitzpatrick rolls in a 25-footer for birdie on 5. No celebration. He wears the expression of a man who knows the jig is already up. He returns to -9, as does his playing partner Rory McIlroy, who is also keeping things in perspective. And yet there’s a small bounce in his walk as he departs for the next tee. You’ve seen that bounce before. Tail up. He’s seven back, but won’t be giving this up just yet. The crowd roar him along, betraying a sliver of renewed belief.If … no, let’s get real … when Scottie Scheffler wins this Open, he’ll join an elite club of players to win the Masters Tournament, the PGA Championship and the Open Championship before the age of 30. The other three? Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. That is some company to be keeping. Scottie doesn’t look a man out of place.Haotong Li drops another shot, the result of finding a fairway bunker at 4. But it’s another birdie for Scottie Scheffler, whose drive somehow evades the traps. He takes full advantage of the break, and sends his approach from 172 yards to seven feet. He walks in the putt, and this is all over. What a majestic display this is. What a majestic player he is.-16: Scheffler (4)</p>\n\n<p>-9: English (5), Gotterup (5), Li (4)</p>\n\n<p>-8: Fowler (F), DeChambeau (17), N Højgaard (7), Schauffele (6), McIlroy (4), Fitzpatrick (4)Hideki Matsuyama bounces back from bogey at 13 with birdie at 15 … then hands the shot back again at 16. He’s -7 and running out of steam a little bit after that earlier six-birdie blast.Fowler cards 65Rickie Fowler should have a major to his name. But another year goes by without the popular Californian nabbing a big one. He finishes up with three birdies in a row, though, and he’s back in 30 strokes, one off the Open record matched yesterday by Lee Westwood. A valedictory round of 65 and he ends the week at -8. Confidence restored, next year maybe. Make it happen, Rickie. Here, it’s been a while since we posted this. Any old excuse …“I got a drippy faucet on my Stewie Stewie Cink…”Scottie Scheffler is in complete control of his emotions. Like that’s breaking news. A no-fuss par at 3. Meanwhile up on 4, the gallery falls into a subdued funk, as realisation sets in that their hero Rory McIlroy is already running out of holes, and of hope. From the centre of the fairway, he shoves his approach into thick rubbish to the right of the green. Unable to control the chip coming out, it twangs on the downslope and races off 40 feet past the hole. That leads to bogey, and he’s back to -8.“Sergio reaching C-level meltdown on the tee at 2, then going on to make birdie definitely deserves a mention on the blog,” write Patrick and Kelly Della, clearly fans of our not-completely-officially-sanctioned SERGIO MELTDOWN-O-METER. Your wish etc. Oh my. Oh dearie me. Oh Sergio! You’re right, that’s a full C and no mistake. For the record, our hero finished with a 68, ending his week at -3. Gotta love Sergio!Chris Gotterup drains a monster left-to-right slinger on 4! That’s the line all right, like Xander Schauffele before him. Gotterup, the new Scottish Open champion, clearly likes a links. The 26-year-old from New Jersey one to watch at the Open in the coming years. He’s worth keeping an eye on now, actually, rising as he does to -9.Haotong Li’s escape from the bunker at 2 is nearly a full-on blade. His ball whizzes through the green and into a depression on the other side, and he can’t get up and down. Bogey. Scottie Scheffler’s approach wasn’t all that, and he’s got to make do with par on a hole that’s been giving up birdies and eagles today. But despite handing 0.2 shots back to the field, his lead has increased. A reminder that he doesn’t have to make a move; the others do. (A fact hammered home on the par-three 3rd, where Matt Fitzpatrick airmails his tee shot over the green. His ball rests in a divot, he can’t scramble his par, and that’s bogey. Par for Rory.)-15: Scheffler (2)</p>\n\n<p>-10: Li (2)</p>\n\n<p>-9: English (3), McIlroy (3)</p>\n\n<p>-8: DeChambeau (15), R Højgaard (6), Schauffele (4), Hatton (4), Gotterup (3), Fitzpatrick (3)Another birdie for Bryson DeChambeau! He whistles in a right-to-left slider from 30 feet on 15 and rises to -8. At the risk of belabouring the point, but it simply can’t go unannounced: he shot 78 on Thursday! This is turning into one of the great golfing what-ifs.Rasmus Højgaard is this close to raking in a monster for eagle on 5, having driven the green. He tidies up for birdie and moves to -8. Back on 4, the defending champion Xander Schauffele fair rattles a left-to-right swinger into the cup for birdie. Had that not hit the hole, it was racing a long way past. But it did, and the Californian moves to -8 as well.Rasmus Hojgaard of Denmark in action. Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty Images… but nothing’s certain yet, of course. Up on the 2nd green, Rory McIlroy, having sent his approach into a swale to the right of the green, nearly holes out for eagle with a Texas Wedge. He taps in to move to -9. Par for Matt Fitzpatrick. Then coming behind, Scottie Scheffler comes up short of the green, while Haotong Li finds a bunker guarding the front right. A reminder that there’s a long way to go. Bogey meanwhile for Hideki Matsuyama at the long and notoriously difficult par-three 16th (which Scottie has birdied every day, naturally) and he slips back to -7.Scottie Scheffler and Haotong Li crack their drives down the middle of 2. Now then, we mentioned Henrik Stenson’s lowest winning total of 264 at Troon in 2016. If Scheffler wants to beat that mark, he’ll need to shoot 64 today. Meanwhile if Haotong Li wants to break the record for lowest total by a runner-up, he’ll need to card a final round of 63, which he’s done before at Birkdale in 2016. Should Li do that, he’d beat the mark of 267 set by both Phil Mickelson at Troon in 2016 and Jordan Spieth at Sandwich in 2021. Not that we’re making huge assumptions about the order in which everyone’s going to finish. Oh no no no.Scheffler taps in for his birdie and moves five clear. All of a sudden, Li’s three-foot birdie putt, which looked a sure thing moments ago, looks double the length. So hats off to him for rapping it into the centre of the cup. Meanwhile birdie at 2 for Harris English, who is determined not to let this turn into a Watson-Nicklaus or Stenson-Mickelson style two-man duel.-15: Scheffler (1)</p>\n\n<p>-11: Li (1)</p>\n\n<p>-9: English (2), Fitzpatrick (1)</p>\n\n<p>-8: Hatton (3), Gotterup (2), McIlroy (1)Haotong Li arrows his second at 1 to three feet. Gauntlet down! Scottie’s response? A 9-iron which lands softly ten feet to the right of the hole, then, using a mixture of spin and camber, pulls his ball back to kick-in distance! That’s simply sensational. Next!Rory McIlroy’s birdie putt has a huge left-to-right swing. He doesn’t set it out wide enough. Opening par. And it’s the same for Matt Fitzpatrick, who chips up to three feet and tidies up for his saver. All good and well … but none of the chasing pack have made the early birdies they need. Well, Tyrrell Hatton did, but handed it back immediately. See also Rasmus Højgaard, who started with a birdie-birdie bang but has just bogeyed 4 to drop back to -7.Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy reacts on the first green. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesThe final group take to the tee. Haotong Li whip-cracks an iron down the middle. Then the leader Scottie Scheffler, who tugs at his iron slightly. It looks like heading into the thick stuff down the left, but takes a lucky bounce to the right and settles in the semi-rough. But you make your own luck, and Scottie has made only three bogeys all week. Here we go, then!Rory McIlroy is out and about, soundtracked by the usual ozone-layer-bothering roars. An iron straight down the middle. An approach straight down the middle and over the flag. He’ll have a 20-foot putt coming back for birdie. Matt Fitzpatrick has some work to do, though, having dispatched his tee shot into the rough down the left, then sent a flyer over the back of the green. Meanwhile Hideki Matsuyama’s eagle putt at 12 shaves the hole, Tyrrell Hatton’s bunkered tee shot at 2 leads to bogey, and here’s how the top of the leaderboard looks right now.-14: Scheffler</p>\n\n<p>-10: Li</p>\n\n<p>-9: Fitzpatrick</p>\n\n<p>-8: Matsuyama (12), R Hojgaard (3), Hatton (2), English (1), Gotterup (1), McIlroy</p>\n\n<p>-7: DeChambeau (13), Fleetwood (11), Hall (7), MacIntyre (3), Henley (3), Schauffele (2)What Bryson DeChambeau would give to play his Thursday round again. A 78 had him almost certainly going home early, but he’s responded like the two-time major-winning champion he is: a 65 to avoid the cut with something to spare, a 68 yesterday, and now he’s five-under for his round today through 12 holes! Birdies at 3, 4, 7, 9 and 12. He’s -7 for the championship, and if he’d got his act together like this for his first round, he’d be thinking about breaking Henrik Stenson’s record for lowest winning total of 264, set at Troon in 2016, and it’d be Scottie Scheffler doing all the chasing today. But he didn’t, so he isn’t, and Scottie won’t be, so here we are. Still, what a response!Tommy Fleetwood is too far back to dream, but he appears to be in the mood to make up as much ground as possible anyway. He’s out in 32 after birdies at 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9. The Southport star is -7. Meanwhile irritation early doors for Bob MacIntyre, who nearly rolls in a 40-footer for eagle at 2, but his ball stops one dimple shy. His playing partner Rasmus Hojgaard meanwhile starts birdie-birdie. They’re -7 and -8 respectively.The chasing pack need birdies immediately if they’re to cause Scottie Scheffler any concern. Tyrrell Hatton flies out of the traps with a pretty much perfect birdie on 1, his tee shot down the middle his approach stuck to three feet, the putt straight into the cup. He moves to -9, though he’s found a fairway bunker with his drive at 2, so there goes any hope of eagle.Three birdies in a row for the 2021 Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama. He moves to -7 after picking up strokes at 2, 5, 9, 10 and now 11, five under for his round like the aforementioned Maverick McNealy. Matsuyama tied for sixth on his Open debut at Muirfield in 2013, but hasn’t done much in the Championship since. He’s currently on target for just his second top-ten finish.Hideki Matsuyama of Japan tees off on the ninth hole. Photograph: Stuart Kerr/R&A/Getty ImagesNone of the amateurs made the cut this year, so nobody will be awarded the Silver Medal. For the record, the best-performing amateurs this year were Cameron Adam, a 22-year-old from Fife, and Ethan Fang, a 20-year-old Texan who won the Amateur Championship this year and of whom big things are expected. Both finished their week at +3, a couple of shots shy of weekend survival.Maverick McNealy is the hottest property out on the course right now. He’s five under for his round, having followed up eagle at 2 with birdies at 3, 9, 10, 13 and 14. Bogeys at 4 and 7 clearly didn’t derail his momentum. The 29-year-old Californian is finally beginning to deliver on all the early hype, and he’s -6 overall.Lowry shoots 66Low scoring, then. Well, yeah! The big story of the morning was Shane Lowry, who six years ago did what Scottie Scheffler is likely to do today: amble around Portrush with the Claret Jug as good as already pocketed. Lowry’s gone out in style, in more ways than one: he went out in 32 strokes, and then nearly holed out from the bottom of the big swale to the left of 18. Inches away from a sensational valedictory blow. A 66 to bid farewell, and he ends the week at -2. Not what he was dreaming of, but the 2019 champion golfer will always have … er … Portrush.Rain and possible thunderstorms were forecast for Sunday at the start of the week. But while the forecasters have got most things spot on, this call was way wide of the mark. It’s sunny and hot! Low scores ahoy! Not too much in the way of wind, either, though gusts may pick up a little later in the afternoon. The forecasters weren’t that far wide of the mark though: those showers and thunderstorms may heave into view in the evening, but by then everything most likely will be done and dusted. A glorious Open Sunday!PreambleLet’s not put too fine a point on it: the 153rd Open Championship is Scottie Scheffler’s to lose, and the final round at Portrush will most likely become a procession. Bigger 54-hole leads have been lost in the past … but Scheffler is of a different stripe to poor old Jean Van de Velde, who went into the final round at Carnoustie in 1999 five clear and so full of hope. It’s not totally beyond the realms that one of the chasing pack could overhaul the leader’s four-stroke advantage, but that’d surely take a perfect storm of a round in the mid-to-low 60s while the world number one suffers a series of absurdly bad bounces and/or an incomprehensible implosion. Having said all that, this is golf, so.Here’s how the top of the leaderboard looked after the third round …-14: Scheffler</p>\n\n<p>-10: Li</p>\n\n<p>-9: Fitzpatrick</p>\n\n<p>-8: McIlroy, Gotterup, English, Hatton</p>\n\n<p>-7: Schauffele</p>\n\n<p>-6: Henley, N Højgaard, MacIntyre, R Højgaard, Harman</p>\n\n<p>-5: Clark, Wallace, Lindell, Reitan, Åberg, Rose, Hall, Westwood… and here’s today’s tee sheet (all times BST, GB&I unless stated).

      "content": "<p>The final major championship test this season concludes Sunday the world's best golfers chase one of the most coveted prizes in golf: the Claret Jug.  Along with golf's oldest major trophy and the title of Champion Golfer of the Year, players will be vying for their portion of a $17 million purse at the 2025 Open Championship at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. The R&A announced The Open is carrying the same prize pool as 2024's record-setting purse with the winner taking home a $3.1 million check like Xander Schauffele did last year. That is a handsome payday but not one all that uncommon at this time in professional golf. The Open Championship is the paradigm of prize money not determining the importance of an event, as the total purse is less than the other three majors and even a PGA Tour signature event -- the winner's cut being the same amount. However, no one would confuse a signature event as being as important as The Open, and while the R&A has upped its payouts amid golf's purse arm's race, it has not chased being the sport's ultimately payday. The chance to etch one's name in golf history is what makes The Open one of the most important and special events in the sport. Certainly those in the United Kingdom would argue it's the most important. Still, a $3.1 million payday doesn't hurt for the winner, and the top three finishers each receiving over $1 million is not too shabby, either.With Scottie Scheffler on top after three rounds and hometown star Rory McIlroy inside the top five with plenty of wind in his sails, this Open is going to be an absolute battle to the finish despite Scheffler's significant lead. McIlroy is second on the odds board as a potential winner, but there's six men capable of surpassing Scheffler over the final round. If the weather lets up Sunday as it did Saturday, scores could be remarkably low as play concludes.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure not to miss the action at Royal Portrush by checking out the 2025 Open Championship TV schedule and coverage guide and follow The Open Championship leaderboard live updates with complete coverage from CBS Sports.Let's take a look at everything that's on the line -- from a monetary standpoint -- at The Open Championship on Sunday.2025 Open Championship purse, payoutsTotal purse: $17 million1st: $3,100,0002nd: $1,759,0003rd: $1,128,0004th: $876,0005th: $705,0006th: $611,0007th: $525,0008th: $442,5009th: $388,00010th: $350,60011th: $319,20012th: $282,80013th: $266,00014th: $249,00015th: $231,00016th: $212,70017th: $202,40018th: $193,00019th: $184,90020th: $176,20021st: $168,00022nd: $159,60023rd: $151,00024th: $142,60025th: $137,80026th: $131,80027th: $127,00028th: $122,60029th: $117,30030th: $111,20031st: $107,60032nd: $102,10033rd: $98,50034th: $95,70035th: $92,40036th: $88,70037th: $84,60038th: $80,30039th: $77,40040th: $74,90041st: $71,80042nd: $68,30043rd: $65,20044th: $61,50045th: $58,00046th: $55,00047th: $52,80048th: $50,70049th: $48,40050th: $47,20051st: $46,20052nd: $45,40053rd: $44,70054th: $44,00055th: $43,30056th: $42,70057th: $42,30058th: $42,00059th: $41,70060th: $41,40061st: $41,20062nd: $41,00063rd: $40,80064th: $40,60065th: $40,30066th: $40,00067th: $39,70068th: $39,40069th: $39,10070th: $38,900</p>\n\n<p>If more than 70 professionals make the cut, additional prize money will be added.

But since the start of the tournament, she has been subjected to racist abuse on her social media platforms.Carter, 27, put out a statement on her Instagram account on Sunday. \"From the start of the tournament I have experienced a lot of racial abuse,\" she wrote. \"Whilst I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I don't agree or think it's ok to target someone's appearance or race. As a result of this I will be taking a step back from social media and leaving it to a team to deal with.\"As ever I am grateful for all of the support from the genuine fans but I am taking this measure to protect myself in a bid to keep my focus on helping the team anyway I can. Hopefully speaking out will make the people writing this abuse think twice so that others won't have to deal with it.\"We have made some historic changes with this Lionesses squad that I am so proud to be a part of and my hope is that by speaking out about this it will make another positive change for all. I'm now looking forward and focusing on putting all of my energy into helping my team.\"UEFA and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer were among those to offer support to Carter.

I stand with Jess, the Lionesses, and any players who have suffered racism, on and off the pitch.\"The Lionesses had been taking the knee before matches in a united anti-racism message. But when they play Italy in their Euro 2025 semifinal on Tuesday, they will stand as a group instead. \"We stand with Jess and all Lionesses players past and present who have suffered racism,\" they said as a group. \"No one should have to endure such vile abuse, be that in football or any walk of life.\"Representing our country is the greatest honour. It is not right that while we are doing that, some of us are treated differently simply because of the colour of our skin.\"Until now, we have chosen to take the knee before matches. It is clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism. We have agreed as a squad to remain standing before kick off on Tuesday.\"We hope the game can come together to see what more can be done.

Ben Healy (EF Education–EasyPost) +18mins 41secsRaphael Mayer, CEO of Alaphilippe’s Tudor team, has been explaining that bizarre moment on the finish line to TNT. Mayer says that the crash Alaphilippe was in early in the stage busted the rider’s radio and they had no time to change it. “[Alaphilippe] did a perfect sprint and thought he won. Well, what can we do?“It’s super nice to be third, if you’d asked us this morning to be third in the stage we are happy and with everything that happened – even without this happening – we would be happy. So, we are third and with Michael Storer getting most combative today we are happy and now let’s hope Julian has no severe injuries.”Mauro Gianetti, UAE team principal, has been speaking to media after Wellens’ earned another victory for their outfit: “If there is one rider in the Tour de France who deserves a victory it is Tim Wellens. He is so dedicated to the team, dedicated to Tadej, always five centimetres from Tadej, in training camp, in race, in morale, in everything. Today he was in the break without looking to be in it. he was in a position to not work in the first 50km when it was very hard, the energy he saved in the first part of the breakaway he gave in the final. It was clever, like always, attacking just before the long descent. When he was away the others behind started looking at each other. Another fantastic day for the team and especially for Tim.”Confusion for Tudor and AlaphilippeAlaphilippe celebrated crossing the line like he’d won, which was little odd. Apparently he was completely unaware that Wellens and Campenaerts had already finished, only learning that he actually finished third in the mixed zone. I bet he feels a bit silly. No interview requests being taken at this time.Julian Alaphilippe celebrates wildly… after finishing third. Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersThe peloton is only just coming under the flamme rouge. The GC leaders won’t be too fussed about the results ahead apart from Ben Healy, who could lose ground to Rodriguez. We will get confirmation on that shortly.Campenaerts breaks off the front of the chasers and takes second place on the stage, it looks like Alaphilippe got third, just ahead of Van Aert.Tim Wellens win stage 15!The UAE rider and Belgian national champion timed his break to perfection and destroyed the field. He high-fives some fans and crosses the line solo. He will have a couple of minutes wait for the next riders to follow him.Belgium's Tim Wellens crosses the finish line to win the fifteenth stage. Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP3km to go. Wellens looks relaxed as he powers to the line. He’s giving thumbs up to the TV cameras and pumping his fists.4km to go. Van Aert might well catch the chasing group, he is about 10 seconds behind them as Simmons tries to attack again.6km to go. The chasers have given up, they’re now trailing by 1min 45secs.9km to go. Wellens is nearly at the end of this long descent and on the flat into Carcassonne.Belgium's Tim Wellens speeds downhill as he leads.) Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/AP13km to go. This will be another stage win for UAE, their fifth of the Tour. Pogacar, of course, has the other four.16km to go. All cohesion has gone from the chasers, they’re just attacking each other.19km to go. Wellens is gone and away, he leads by 1min 25secs. The battle is now for second place24km to go. There is some interest in the peloton in hunting down the chase group. Carlos Rodriguez, the Ineos rider, could move up the GC standings at the expense of EF Education’s Ben Healy.30km to go. Wellens has truly broken today’s stage, he has 57 seconds on the chasers now and surely a stage win in his grasp. What an attack. He sat in the lead group and did minimal work before pouncing at the key moment, just before the start of the descent.36km to go. Wellens now has a lead of 29 seconds. The descent makes up most of the run into the line, there will be only 7km to the end of the stage once Wellens gets off the bottom of the hill.39km to go. Wellens has a 18 second lead now. Barguil, Storer, Campenaerts, Vlasov and Simmons are barreling downhill to catch up.43km to go. Tim Wellens has gone for a long range attack. He waited for the group of Barguil to catch up and then went off. Quinn Simmons is chasing but the Belgian rider has got a gap and is now on the descent.46km to go. Rodriguez, Barguil, Vlasov and Lutsenko are the second group on the road and 20 seconds behind the leaders. Their hopes of winning the stage are not completely over, yet.Tony Hughes has emailed in with an interesting take:If Jonas wins nothing ever again, or retires or whatnot, I hope even with his stolid demeanor, he can at some point look back and take comfort in the fact that he held off what may be the greatest cyclist of all time for two consecutive years (acknowledging Tadej’s crash/injury in 2023 contributed to this). Neutrals may wish for a Fignon-LeMond-esque finish each year but the battle between Tadej and Jonas during the 2020s has to me, in every way, been as fascinating. Chess on wheels.50km to go. The leaders are through the steepest section of the climb and the gradients are now much severe. There is not a lot of harmony amongst them though and if they are reeled in it will be because they haven’t worked together. The keep on attacking each other and that is not the way to grow the time gap.52km to go. The second group on the road are now more than 35 seconds behind the leaders.53km to go. Storer wants to attack that group of leaders again. He probably needs to break Simmons, Campeanaerts and Wellens on this climb to win.55km to go. With Barguil and Vlasov riding over the leading group has grown again, but not for long. Simmons and Storer have gone away off the front on the category two climb. Will this stick? There are two more riders behind Simmons and Storer, Campeanaerts and Wellens.56km to go. The nine riders at the front are being closed down by the larger group behind. Barguil and Vlasov are now 12 seconds behind.61km to go. Leknessund is now across and the second group on the road is now only 20 seconds or so back. That is just a couple of riders, Warren Barguil and Aleksandr Vlasov.62km to go. Leknessund has made ground on the leading group of eight. He is now about 15 seconds behind.74km to go. The leaders are heading down the Côte de Sorèze and are coming up to the next climb in 15km or so. Andreas Leknessund is 30 seconds behind that group of eight and behind him are 25 riders, then a fair bit further behind (2mins 47secs) is the peloton, which features the yellow jersey. I think it’s now safe to say that winner will come from those 34 riders who have escaped the peloton and most likely the eight up the very front.83km to go. Rodriguez has made it, so that lead group is now eight men.84km to go. Ineos rider Carlos Rodriguez is trying to chase down the seven men at the front the race. He has about seconds to make up and that would be a big boost for his team, who missed the original break.87km to go. The lead group has been whittled down to seven riders as they hit the second category Côte de Sorèze climb. Campenaerts, Lutsenko, Simmons, Wellens, Powless, Storer and Mohoric are now 47 seconds ahead of the remaining number from the original breakaway and a number of others from the main peloton.The breakaway group with Quinn Simmons ahead of Tim Wellens, Neilson Powless, Michael Storer and Axel Laurence. Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/AP92km to go. This is shifting again. Four riders have gone off after the breakaway but are still some 30 seconds behind.97km to go. Milan seems to have a problem again. He has fallen about a minute behind the peloton and even further back is a 38-rider group featuring the current polka dot jersey leader, Lenny Martinez.Robin Lynch has emailed in as he still has a few things on his wishlist for the final week:Looking forward to the final stage in Paris with the Montmartre climb and hoping that Wout can win that one. Would love to see Vingegaard take one of the mountain stages and a bit of spice for the last podium place between Vauquelin, Onley, Lipowitz on stage 19. Feels too greedy to hope for a late hurrah from Alaphilippe, but praying to the cycling gods nonetheless.103km to go. The frantic racing has calmed a little now. The breakaway has a lead of around 50 seconds and rising, Ineos appear to have given up the chase for the time being. Van Der Poel will fancy his chances if this breakaway is allowed to stay out in front.108km to go. Van Der Poel has taken the 20 points on offer at the intermediate sprint to close in on Pogacar in second place in the green jersey standings.Mathieu van der Poel of Alpecin-Deceuninck attacks during stage 15. Photograph: Shutterstock110km to go. The intermediate sprint is coming up in a kilometre. The peloton is now back together and 30 seconds behind the lead group.More thoughts on Pogacar’s game plan from John Westwell via email:I wasn’t surprised that Pogacar didn’t seem bothered about winning yesterday’s stage, and I’d be even more surprised if he doesn’t just want to sit back and have a ‘steady’ day today. He knows he’s in control of the race now.He will almost certainly be looking to win on Mont Ventoux on Tuesday, though. Not least because Eddy Merckxx won on the summit in 1970 and Pogacar seems keen to measure himself against Merckxx at every opportunity.Andrew Benton has emailed in from Hong Kong with what he’s looking out for in the final week:I’ll be looking for Geraint Thomas to bag a stage win. I’d imagine he’s not planning to, but perhaps an opportunity could present itself, and that would be super. And one for Julian Alaphilippe, too, why not.In the ‘90s it was Indurain, in the 2000s Armstrong (its not about the bike, he wrote - and clearly it was not) and now, in the mid and late 20s, will we be seeing year after year of Pogacar victories? I don’t think so - he’ll dominate for a few years, but there are always others coming after him and they can be victorious, opportunity and chance can play a big role. But I don’t have a favourite, as long as the suspense continues until the last couple of stages each year.118km to go. Ineos do not have a rider in the lead group and are working hard on the front of the peloton to bring that back. The gap is holding around 40 seconds.120km to go. Just as I write that Milan and Pogacar are in the same group, a split appears in the peloton. Milan is on the wrong side of it and the green jersey is now in the third group on the road, around 20 seconds behind the peloton.125km to go. The intermediate sprint is rapidly approaching, coming up in about 15km. The current green jersey leader is Jonathan Milan, who is 28 points ahead of the Pogacar. Both of them are in the main peloton but Van Der Poel is in the breakaway and could make up some serious ground in that particualr race today.127km to go. Girmay has given up his pursuit of the breakaway, which now has a lead of 40 seconds over the peloton.131km to go. The peloton is now back together, with Pogacar, Vingegaard and Florian Lipowitz all together.134km to go. There are plenty of attacks happening. Biniam Girmay is the latest to go off from Pogacar’s group in pursuit of the 15-rider breakaway and have made up about 12 seconds.137km to go. A large-ish group featuring Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease a Bike), Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), Matej Mohoric (Bahrain Victorious), Clément Russo (Groupama-FDJ), Kaden Groves, Mathieu Van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Matteo Vercher (Total Energies), Alexey Lutsenko (Israel Premier Tech) and Jarrad Drizners (Lotto) are hovering around 30 seconds ahead of Pogacar’s group. The chasers off the back, a group which features Vingegaard, are catching the main bunch. The gap now is around 26 seconds, but the pace is very high.143km to go. The peloton is about one minute behind Pogacar’s group. A slightly chaotic start to stage 15 which has limited any breakaway threats.146km to go. The peloton is back together at the front, but there are some gaps further back. UAE Team radio has just been played on the broadcast requesting that Pogacar slow the front of the race as a Vingegaard was caught in the crash incident. It’s not clear whether or not the Dane was involved in the crash itself.148km to go. We’ve had a couple of crashes in the early running, Julian Alaphilippe had to go the medical car but has resumed. Jordi Meeus and Gianni Moscon are pacing Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) back to the bunch.150km to go. Neilson Powless of EF Education-EasyPost has gone off the front on his own but he was chased by Tobias Foss, Alexey Lutsenko and Yevgeniy Fedorov. This doesn’t look like it’s going to stick as they have less than 15 seconds on the peloton.We are underwayBit of confusion on my part, caused by ITV’s race coverage starting a little later and the baffling CET. Anyway, we’re now off racing.Lotto have announced that Lennert Van Eetvelt will not start stage 15 and is withdrawing from the Tour de France. Van Eetvelt crashed at the Belgian national championships and was involved in an incident during the second stage of the Tour. According to his team, ‘the physical toll’ has proven too much for him to continue and he will now begin recovery.As ever, you can get in touch via email. The link is at the top of this page. With the yellow jersey seemingly decided, I’d be interested to hear what you’ll be looking out for during the final week of the Tour.The peloton will soon be rolling out of Muret and then it’ll be another 10 minutes to KM0 where the racing will get underway.A quick reminder of the various standingsGeneral classification1.

Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling Team) 14PreambleIt was nice of Tadej Pogacar to finally let some of the other riders to have a go yesterday and he still found a way to twist the knife further into the heart of Jonas Vingegaard’s beleaguered hopes of winning the Tour de France. Even the Dane’s most generous fans would struggle to describe him as a yellow jersey rival now. Pogacar’s advantage is 4mins 13secs and he is essentially racing against himself. The Slovenian has 21 stage wins and there is every chance that he will continue his rapid pursuit of Mark Cavendish’s record. Pogacar made it pretty clear after winning stage 13 on Friday that he is not planning to take any days off.“I’m not here to make enemies,” he said, “but it’s the Tour, you cannot just back off if there’s the opportunity for a stage win. You never know when it’s your last day on the Tour.“I will say it honestly. The team pays you to win, and there’s a big team behind me that supports me and that works every single day of their career to come to the Tour, to win the Tour. If there is an opportunity, you go for it. You can’t say no to a stage in the Tour.”Still, UAE Emirates may look at the empty threat to Pogacar’s general classification lead and decide to play this one safe. There are three categorised climbs and a lumpy to descent into Carcassonne to contend with, so maybe there is a bit of hope for the breakaway? Should that be allowed to play out, such is the nature of professional cycling in this constant-go era that a winner for this stage will likely be a familiar name capable on the slopes from the one-day racing pack. Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Wout van Aert (Visma-LAB) are strong contenders, maybe even Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-LAB) or someone with that kind of profile.For the good of the Tour, a non-Pogacar stage win would be good. Domination can quickly become dull and while there is nothing boring about Pogacar’s style of racing, cycling as a foregone conclusion is not much of a sport.</p>"

A camera and their matching pink hair, was all they needed to take over Indianapolis. They set a goal to stream on Twitch for 72 hours and take their viewers everywhere they went. The content was unhinged but also loved by everyone. As of Sunday night, they had 65.7K followers.StudBudz did an excellent job making those who were at home feel like they were partying with them. As All-Star Game MVP Napheesa Collier put it: \"StudBudz has been the highlight of everybody's weekend.\"There were a lot of memorable moments, here are a few of them:Caitlin Clark fangirlingClark, who the StudBudz referred to as \"the baby GOAT,\" was actively looking for the duo and screamed when she finally found them. Clark loved what they were doing and told them that she had been watching the stream for hours at home.</p>\n\n<p>Paige Bueckers singing her heart outBueckers was one of just six rookies to be named an All-Star starter in the last 20 seasons, which was certainly an unforgettable experience. The ex-UConn star also had a fun weekend off the court.One of her best moments was when she was absolutely not holding back while singing \"Love\" by Keyshia Cole.</p>\n\n<p>They partied with Cathy EngelbertStudBudz got everyone to dance. Everyone. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert, in the middle of some intense CBA negations, went up to StudBudz and told them they are amazing for what they are doing. Shortly after, Engelbert was getting after it with them.</p>\n\n<p>What made it an even more unforgettable moment is the fact that Engelbert danced to \"Knuck If You Buck\" by Crime Mob, not quite a song you associate with a league commissioner.</p>\n\n<p>Angel Reese was a StudBudz favoriteThe duo meet up with Angel Reese multiple times. They interviewed her, joked around and danced a lot. Angel Reese's mom had been watching the stream too and was loving StudBudz as much as everyone else. She eventually ran into them and got to give Williams a hug.</p>\n\n<p>So much Pink Pony ClubChappell Roan couldn't have gotten better publicity for her song because StudBudz played it A LOT. When Williams was disappointed after leaving a club that didn't fit her style, she played Pink Pony Club in the car ride to another party and her mood seemed to instantly get better.</p>\n\n<p>Even Collier danced to their favorite song during practice.</p>\n\n<p>StudBudz X DiploThe power and charm of StudBudz were on full display on Sunday night when they got world-famous DJ Diplo to change his EDM vibe so they could get down to music that was more their style. They went from struggling to get into a club to taking over the Sports Illustrated party in just a matter of minutes.StudBudz made it on Diplo's Instagram story by the end of the night.</p>"

      "content": "<p>A thrilling 2025 golf season has reached the conclusion of its final major as The Open Championship wraps up its 153rd playing Sunday at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. The oldest golf tournament in the world is consummating its return to Portrush for the first time after a six-year absence with the Claret Jug set to be awarded on site for just the third time in event history.While Xander Schauffele entered as the reigning Champion Golfer of the Year, all eyes have been focused on hometown favorite Rory McIlroy, the No. 2 golfer in the world. Already a three-time winner this season -- including locking up his first Masters to complete the career grand slam -- it was thought McIlroy would be the clear favorite entering Royal Portrush. Instead, following a brief struggle stretch, McIlroy was second on the odds board behind Scottie Scheffler.That has proven to be the correct decision by oddsmakers as Scheffler shot a career-low round of 64 in a major championship to move into a one-stroke lead entering the weekend, an advantage he's extended to four strokes going into the final round. Early in Round 4, Scheffler ballooned his lead to seven shots, and despite scoring a rare double bogey before making the turn, he is well on his way to run away with the Claret Jug on Sunday afternoon.While McIlroy has been firmly in contention -- far better than he stood at the weekend in 2019 at Royal Portrush when he missed the cut -- he's failed to match -- let alone exceed Scheffler shot for shot down the stretch. Instead, it is HaoTong Li and Chris Gotterup providing Scheffler's greatest competition Sunday.The Claret Jug and $3.1 million winner's share from the 2025 Open purse are still up for grabs, and some golf left to play, anything can happen at Royal Portrush.

      "content": "Kevin SeifertJul 20, 2025, 06:00 AM ETCloseKevin Seifert is a staff writer who covers the Minnesota Vikings and the NFL at ESPN. Kevin has covered the NFL for over 20 years, joining ESPN in 2008. He was previously a beat reporter for the Minneapolis Star Tribune and Washington Times. He is a graduate of the University of Virginia.EAGAN, Minn. -- For one hour per week last fall, Minnesota Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell cleared his calendar. He put aside game-planning, practice prep and film study. He ensured he had no team meetings scheduled, no news conferences and no phone calls that needed to be returned.Instead, O'Connell turned his focus to the franchise's most important long-term asset: quarterback J.J. McCarthy.The pair spent that hour meeting one-on-one in O'Connell's office, the centerpiece of an extensive program the Vikings arranged (while attending to the immediate needs of a 14-3 regular season), to ensure that McCarthy's rookie year was not a total loss.Unable to play because of a torn meniscus in his right knee and prohibited from practicing by NFL rules for players on injured reserve, McCarthy remained engaged and demonstrated enough development to enter 2025 training camp as the Vikings' expected starting quarterback.\"I just wanted to give him a platform with me,\" O'Connell told ESPN. \"Maybe it was football one day. Maybe it was no football. My time is very hard to find during the season, but I just wanted to make sure that we got together.\"The one thing I learned about him in those meetings is he had great questions, and that validated that he was receiving and getting something out of that time. And as I've told him, it doesn't really guarantee you anything, but once you're fighting the fight on a daily basis of growing within the system, he would be able to rely on some of what we did together.\"WHY DID THE Vikings bid farewell to 2024 starter Sam Darnold and in the process become the first team in NFL history to allow a quarterback to depart a year after throwing at least 30 touchdown passes?Why did they accept the exits of Daniel Jones and Nick Mullens, both of whom spent time on the Vikings roster last season, and pass on signing free agent Aaron Rodgers?Why are the Vikings turning over a playoff-ready team to a 22-year-old who became the first quarterback selected in the first round during the NFL's modern draft era (1967) to miss his entire rookie season because of injury?Part of the answer relates to the Vikings' long-term philosophy. McCarthy's rookie contract, which carries a salary cap charge of only $4.9 million this season and $5.9 million in 2026, is an important chip to aid roster construction. But the rest of it can be traced to McCarthy's behind-the-scenes work in the five months after his injury (suffered Aug. 10), both in his meetings with O'Connell and through an increasing workload of projects created by quarterbacks coach Josh McCown.In the highly structured world of the NFL, the Vikings found creative ways to squeeze McCarthy into their day.The process started when McCarthy was confined to a postsurgery scooter that allowed him to traverse the team's vast practice facility but avoid putting weight on his right leg. Still getting used to operating the scooter, McCarthy put it in reverse and accidentally rammed the doorframe in O'Connell's office. \"A little paint chip,\" McCarthy said, \"but nothing else.\"O'Connell timed the meetings for what he called the \"sweet spot\" of game week, after coaches had presented the majority of the offensive game plan, including the third-down package. Usually that fell on Thursday afternoons.By that time, McCarthy had observed Darnold's assimilation of the game plan during quarterback meetings. Those meetings would end, and while active players went to the locker room to prepare for practice, McCarthy would head to O'Connell's office and go through a mental process the rookie otherwise would have experienced on the field.\"That way,\" O'Connell said, \"when he watched the tape of that practice that night, and later when he was eventually able to start coming out to watch practice, he's seeing an extension of that meeting if we handled it the right way.\"McCarthy had access to traditional game film as well as a dedicated camera the Vikings attached to Darnold's helmet, allowing the rookie to see not only where Darnold looked pre-snap and post-snap but also to hear what he was saying in conjunction with the offensive line and even the defensive signals. That film was viewable on the wide screen the Vikings have installed in their draft room and with virtual-reality gear.In some weeks, O'Connell said, the focus was more on understanding how McCarthy was handling his recovery while missing an entire season of football. Speaking on \"The Rich Eisen Show\" in January, McCarthy recalled that \"a lot of it was just on life, just getting to know each other and growing that chemistry that a quarterback and a head coach, especially a playcaller, needs.\"O'Connell said: \"This was a guy that had success at every level he's ever played and had something taken away from him for a whole season. And he's still very young, age-wise and NFL-experience wise.\"So you felt like you had to sometimes say, 'Let's not talk protection blitzes or progressions or fundamentals and technique.' It's, 'How are you doing?' And try to just make sure he knows that we're building our own relationship as well. And that I've got his back.\"ONE OF THE advantages of a quarterbacks coach such as McCown, who played for 12 teams over 18 NFL seasons, is that he has seen it all. He knows that quarterbacks at the bottom of the depth chart, or on injured reserve, can go through seasons with minimal attention.\"Sometimes,\" McCown said, \"it's just out of sight, out of mind.\"The Vikings knew they could not afford such inattention with McCarthy. McCown developed a list of tasks, some of them mundane and some at a higher level, to include McCarthy in everything he could. Some weeks, he would ask McCarthy to write out every third-down play the Vikings had in their weekly game plan, so that the rest of the quarterbacks could refer to it while going through a film session.\"Something like that is a tedious job,\" McCown said, \"but it helps you memorize. And then we'd steal moments when we would quiz him or ask him questions about it, just at random times when we could.\"We're mostly interacting with Sam and questioning Sam on plays, and you don't know what J.J. is taking in and what he's not taking in. But every now and then, it was, 'Hey J.J., what about this?' You try to engage him as if he's playing, and he was on top of it.\"When the rest of the quarterbacks headed to the locker room, McCarthy and McCown would remain in the meeting room, going through the mental exercises of what he would have experienced in practice or a walk-through.\"Can you turn the information around?\" McCown said. \"That's what we were testing him on, and he was always right on it, which was very encouraging.\"Another project included research and writing profiles of opposing defensive coordinators, including what coaching tree they came from to help connect their schemes with other teams, as well as scouting reports on defensive players.\"It was making sure that I knew all the ins and outs and all the busy work on the front end,\" McCarthy said, \"when I had the time for it. So [this year] I don't have to spend too much time on things that aren't going to show up in the biggest way and just really making sure I can be efficient with my prepping and my game-plan studying.\"On occasion, McCown would ask McCarthy to present information to the group.\"It's not just about listening and learning,\" McCown said. \"But can you process that information and give it back to me? I think that's huge because you're trying to manufacture as many ways as you can to keep his mind around football, processing football, how to attack an opponent, how to think about things.\"And that's what I told him. I was like, 'You got to take this time to prepare like you're the guy and figure out the things that you like and don't like about that preparation process that's going to help you get to where you need to go once you're in that seat someday.'\"McCarthy took some initiative on his own. Defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said McCarthy approached him shortly after McCarthy got hurt to interrogate him about identifying alignments on the defensive front. \"He was just asking those great questions,\" Phillips said.Each week, McCown asked McCarthy to turn in his notes so he could review what he was -- and wasn't -- picking up.O'Connell assessed McCarthy's work this way: \"It's hard sometimes to know exactly how smart somebody is. What are they really going to be able to retain when they start loading a lot of information? And I think he's demonstrated that he's got pretty high-level intelligence and there's a lot there.\"DESPITE THEIR BEST efforts, the Vikings know that McCarthy missed some key development opportunities last season, including seemingly innocuous moments such as running the scout team.\"It's like going to the driving range,\" McCown said. \"It's where you get to practice all your clubs. There's kind of no consequence, so to speak, and you really learn different types of throws that you can make in different windows.\"Sometimes the defensive coaches are asking you to throw it to this player, so I better cut this ball loose early. I better anticipate. So that hones your anticipation skills. And that's the hardest thing that you don't necessarily get to replace, just not being on the field.\"Over the course of the fall, McCarthy began writing in what he called a \"gratitude journal,\" a practice he learned at the University of Michigan from life coach Greg Harden, who died in September. McCarthy believed it would help him focus on the benefits of what he could do as a player on injured reserve, rather than fixating on what he could not.\"I haven't had an injury like this that sat me down for so long,\" McCarthy said, \"and I was very grateful for the opportunity that I had to really get a head start on the mental side of the game.\"Getting on the same page with [O'Connell] has been awesome. Last season, seeing how he calls the games and everything like that, as well as the intricate personality traits of the guys on the team -- and him being able to feed those that help strengthen the overall group and help strengthen them individually -- and be there for them when some things aren't going their way.\""

      "content": "<p>Brock Purdy and George Kittle got paid this offseason, and Christian McCaffrey feels \"great\" after injuries limited him to just four games last year. But that's where the good news ends for the San Francisco offense heading into training camp.The 49ers placed six players on their active/physically unable to perform list Friday, including wide receivers Brandon Aiyuk (knee) and Ricky Pearsall (hamstring). And Jauan Jennings is upset over his contract and will reportedly request a trade if he cannot secure a new deal before the season.There are a lot of moving parts in San Francisco, especially for this passing game, but let's start with the positives. And McCaffrey being healthy is fantastic.You have to be nervous about McCaffrey after he played only four games last season due to Achilles and knee injuries. He's also 29 now, but he took part in OTAs and minicamp with no restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the concerns, McCaffrey still has as much upside as any player in the NFL. In 2023, he averaged 24.5 PPR points per game, and he was at 21.2 PPR points in 2022. He could get back to that level if he stays healthy, and I'm willing to draft him as early as No. 7 overall.If McCaffrey falls into Round 2 then consider that a gift, and he's worth the risk given the reward. The nice thing about drafting McCaffrey is you can cover yourself by drafting Isaac Guerendo as early as Round 8. Last year, Guerendo had five games as a rookie with double digits in touches, and he averaged 16.3 PPR points over that span, which is great replacement value.Kittle is one of my favorite players to draft this season, and he was actually the No. 1 tight end in 2024 at 15.8 PPR points per game. He could have another big season, especially with Deebo Samuel gone. Kittle has played 13 games without Samuel since 2019, and Kittle averaged 16.1 PPR points over that span. He has 62 catches for 991 yards and eight touchdowns on 87 targets without Samuel.</p>\n\n<p>Kittle also has a good track record when Aiyuk is out. Kittle has played 12 games without Aiyuk since 2020, and Kittle averaged 14.6 PPR points over that span. He had 62 catches for 933 yards and two touchdowns on 75 targets over that span.There were only three games that Kittle played with Samuel and Aiyuk both out, but none were with Purdy at quarterback. I'm not going to worry about that small sample size when evaluating Kittle this year.For now, you can draft Kittle in Round 4, but I would look for him toward the end of Round 3. And his value could potentially rise the longer Aiyuk and Pearsall remain out, along with the uncertainty surrounding Jennings.</p>\n\n<p>While Aiyuk and Pearsall are currently on the active/physically unable to perform list, they can be activated at any point during training camp if medically cleared. Players are not permitted to practice, but they can participate in team meetings and utilize team facilities while they are on the list.Aiyuk's injury is more concerning than Pearsall since Aiyuk suffered a torn ACL and MCL in his right knee in Week 7 last year. While no official timetable is set, he might not be ready for Week 1, and Fantasy managers should act accordingly.I'm only drafting Aiyuk with a late-round pick, and I have minimal expectations for him coming off this injury. Prior to getting hurt last season, Aiyuk only had one game with more than 9.8 PPR points, and he didn't score a touchdown.</p>\n\n<p>I'm more optimistic for Pearsall, even though he did not take part in OTAs after he injured his hamstring during offseason workouts. When healthy, he could be the No. 1 receiver in San Francisco this year with Aiyuk out, especially if Jennings is dealing with his contract.Pearsall looked the part of being a standout Fantasy option in his final two games in 2024. He had eight catches for 141 yards and a touchdown on 10 targets against Detroit in Week 17 and six catches for 69 yards and a touchdown on eight targets in Week 18 at Arizona. Remember that Pearsall didn't make his NFL debut until Week 7 following a gunshot wound to his chest in late August. His first solid outing came in Week 10 at Tampa Bay with four catches for 73 yards and a touchdown on six targets. In total, he had three games as a rookie with at least six targets, and he scored at least 17.3 PPR points in all three outings. That's something to build off this year, and Pearsall is worth drafting as early as Round 7 if he's activated off the PUP list soon.</p>\n\n<p>As for Jennings, he could be the No. 1 receiver for the 49ers, which might make him a weekly starter in all leagues. In 2024, when Samuel struggled and Aiyuk was injured, Jennings averaged a career-best 14.0 PPR points per game. He had seven games with at least eight targets, and he scored at least 16.3 PPR points in four of those outings. Hopefully, Jennings will get his contract situation settled soon, and he would vault ahead of Pearsall in my rankings, especially if Pearsall is hurt. But I'm afraid the Jennings situation will linger, and the earliest I would draft him is Round 8.All of these receiver concerns will impact how Fantasy managers view Purdy. I would only draft him as a high-end backup with a late-round pick, but his value could rise if everyone is healthy (Aiyuk and Pearsall) and happy (Jennings).</p>\n\n<p>The nice thing for Purdy is he averaged 22.4 Fantasy points in 2023 and 20.5 points in 2024. I would expect him to be in that range again this season, and he's a great quarterback to wait for on Draft Day.Aside from the main weapons in San Francisco, Fantasy managers in deeper leagues should keep an eye on backup receivers like Demarcus Robinson, Jacob Cowing and Jordan Watkins in case Aiyuk, Pearsall and Jennings miss any time. Of that group, Robinson would be the one to target given his history with the Rams, but I'm curious to see what Cowing could do with an expanded role.You should also monitor rookie running back Jordan James, who is likely third on the depth chart behind McCaffrey and Guerendo. Last year, Guerendo didn't get his chance to play until McCaffrey and Jordan Mason got injured, and potentially the same thing could unfold this season given McCaffrey's injury track record.</p>\n\n<p>The next few weeks in San Francisco will be interesting. And Fantasy managers will have to adjust to all the news with the 49ers this season.</p>"

The 2025 AutoTrader EchoPark Automotive 400 will be held on Sunday at Dover Motor Speedway, an oval affectionately referred to as \"The Monster Mile\" that first appeared on the NASCAR schedule in 1969. Three of the six remaining races during the regular season will be on tracks that measure a mile or shorter, so this will be a huge opportunity for teams to dial in their short-track setups for the stretch run.The green flag drops at 2 p.m. ET on Sunday. Denny Hamlin is the +500 favorite (risk $100 to win $500) in the 2025 AutoTrader EchoPark Automotive 400 odds after capturing his second career win at Dover last year. Chase Elliott (+1100) will start on the pole for Sunday's showdown. Elliott has racked up two victories and 10 top-five finishes in 14 career starts at Dover and is -125 to crack the top five on Sunday.

The three-time NASCAR Cup Series champion was in a similarly fringy position last season but managed to earn his way into the postseason and then continually snuck through each round on his way to winning the title.He's never won before at Dover, but he does have five top-five finishes and 15 top 10s in 28 career Cup starts at \"The Monster Mile,\" so he's run well there generally. The win in Fort Worth looks like the turning point of Logano's season after a rough start and the model is predicting that he puts together another strong run on Sunday and is an inherent value at this price.The model has also revealed a shocking NASCAR prop for Sunday: Tyler Reddick finishes top five for a +240 payout at BetMGM. He's potentially a strong value pick for your Dover NASCAR prop bets, and you can also get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses with this BetMGM promo code.</p>\n\n<p>Reddick has made the NASCAR playoffs in each of the last four seasons and has emerged as a serious title contender since joining 23XI Racing in 2023. He finished sixth in the NASCAR standings during his first season with 23XI and then made the NASCAR Cup Series Championship last season, going on to finish fourth in the season finale at Phoenix on a day when little went his way.He's fourth in the standings entering Sunday's race at \"The Monster Mile\" and he'll comfortably make the postseason again barring four more first-time winners over the final six races of the season. Over his last three races, Reddick has finished fourth, third and sixth, and he'll look to keep that momentum going this week at Dover, where he's managed strong runs (seventh and 11th) in each of the last two seasons. See which other drivers to avoid and the rest of the projected NASCAR leaderboard at SportsLine.How to make 2025 NASCAR at Dover picksThe model is also targeting three  other drivers with Dover NASCAR odds of 14-1 or longer to make a serious run at the checkered flag.

Gupta, who joined the ICC this month from the Indian broadcaster JioStar, will chair the working party, which also features the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive, Richard Gould, and the Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive, Todd Greenberg.The two-division concept first emerged from meetings between CA and the ECB during the women’s Ashes last January. CA, in particular, is a major advocate and has pushed a model that would involve Australia, England and India playing against each other twice every three years rather than the current setup of two series in four years. Although this would appeal to broadcasters and be hugely lucrative, the ECB is understood to have reservations about scheduling more Test series between the so-called big three, as it would further entrench their huge financial advantage over other international sides.The presence of Gupta, Gould and Greenberg on the working group suggests there is a strong possibility the two-division model will be adopted, although the devil will be in the detail of their findings.With such a significant change requiring the support of a two-thirds majority of the ICC’s 12 full members, the biggest challenge will be to agree on a system of promotion and relegation between the two divisions to prevent the smaller nations being cut adrift. An increased package of financial support for countries starting in division two may also be required. Under the current ICC Test rankings, the world Test champions, South Africa, plus New Zealand and Sri Lanka would join the big three in division one, with Ireland, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh in line to be admitted to the World Test Championship for the first time to join Pakistan, West Indies and Zimbabwe in division two.This development came as the ICC announced in Singapore that England will stage the next three World Test Championship finals. The first three showpieces have been held in England, most recently last month at Lord’s, as South Africa were crowned champions for the first time by defeating the holders, Australia.The ICC also discussed creating a new Twenty20 Champions League or World Club Championship that would feature franchises from the Indian Premier League, the Hundred and the Big Bash, but no formal proposal was tabled.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionA previous T20 Champions League run by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, CA and Cricket South Africa was launched in 2008 and lasted until 2014, but collapsed after the main broadcaster ESPN Star failed to pay rights fees. The ICC has expressed interest in running its own version, but it would be a complex undertaking, not least as many of the IPL owners have bought franchises in other countries including South Africa’s SA20, Major League Cricket in the and ILT20 in the United Arab Emirates. The owners of Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals, Lucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad are also in the process of buying into four Hundred franchises.Some of the world’s top T20 players represent as many as four or five franchises each year, so determining whom they would represent would not be straightforward, with 2027 seen as the most likely start date for a new global tournament as that coincides with the end of the ICC’s $3bn (£2.25bn) Indian TV deal with Disney Star.</p>"

      "content": "ESPNJul 20, 2025, 07:13 AM ETThe Euro 2025 tournament is on to the semifinals; we have our Final Four!England came through a mammoth penalty shootout (one of the weirdest ever) against Sweden to set up a clash with Italy, who beat Norway. While world champions Spain knocked out hosts Switzerland to face a dogged Germany -- who ousted France on penalties despite playing with 10 players for over 100 minutes.Emily Keogh, Tom Hamilton, Beth Lindop, Julien Laurens and Sam Marsden have been on the ground at the tournament this summer, so here is their assessment of events so far.What caught your eye in the quarterfinals?Keogh: Ann-Katrin Berger's flying save with  -- full length, with an arm stretched behind her, to prevent what would have been an agonizing own goal by Janina Minge in extra time. It was pure gravity-denying excellence to save Germany from likely elimination against France. She was simply immense. To have beaten cancer twice, been overlooked for a starting spot at national team level for years, to saving nine shots and seeing Germany through to another semifinal on penalties, she is the epitome of a hero. No doubt Germany's grit to hold on after the 13th minute, and through extra time, against a ruthless France team is a talking point. But at the heart of their determination was Berger, and she deserves all the plaudits.Hamilton: I agree with Em: Berger's performance was just astonishing. And if you're looking for heroes, then you have plenty to choose from at these Euros. Lucy Bronze's performance for England against Sweden was just incredible. This is her seventh major tournament and the ageless Bronze just keeps on going. She dragged England through that quarterfinal from two goals down -- she scored the first, kicked the advertising hoarding, and then 103 seconds later, Michelle Agyemang netted the equalizer. In extra time, she took on the captaincy, strapped her own thigh up, then ripped it off for her penalty in a farcical shootout -- hammering what was effectively the winning penalty. Just incredible.Lindop: I'd probably say how closely contested all of the games have been. Two matches went to extra time and penalties while Italy's win over Norway was only sealed with a goal in the 90th minute. Even Spain vs. Switzerland -- which was expected to yield a comfortable win for the world champions -- was still goalless after the hour mark. It just shows how fine the margins are at this level and how there's no such thing as an easy game.Laurens: I don't want to talk about this France disaster against Germany! Berger, coach Christian Wück or anyone! Instead, let's celebrate Bronze and her nerves of steel. To score her penalty like she did, through a chaotic shootout, to have had the intelligence to study the Sweden's keeper's habits and how early she was moving. Bronze is the hero here. She did her own injury strap, and she wore the rainbow captain's armband as a bracelet. She is maybe not having her best tournament but against Sweden she was the leader her team needed at the most crucial time of all. Shout out to Chloe Kelly, too. Super sub and super shin pads with her husband and dog on them, and super pen and run up, too!Marsden: Let's hear it for our hosts, Switzerland, shall we? Bern was incredible for their quarterfinal against Spain -- before, during and after the game. More than 20,000 fans clad in red joined in unison for the fan walk to the ground from Bundesplatz in the city center, over the bridge crossing the River Aare and arriving at the Wankdorf Stadium in a journey that took over an hour. They sang nonstop for 90 minutes -- and for another half an hour after they had been knocked out. \"They didn't want to leave!\" coach Pia Sundhage said. On the pitch, the entertainment has been top drawer, including in Switzerland's game. They kept favorites Spain out for 66 minutes, and while they inevitably came up short, there were some moments where you were wondering: Could they?play1:42Laurens: France's Euro 2025 exit a 'massive failure'Julien Laurens reacts to France's penalty shootout defeat to Germany to miss out on a semifinal spot at Euro 2025.England vs. Sweden had an incredible penalty shootout, but why are players missing so many penalties this tournament?Keogh: Teams could learn a lot in terms of execution, but also preparation. Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson said his side -- who missed three of theirs -- did not prepare for penalties due to the unpredictable nature of knockout football, but that certainly feels like a mistake now. Some practice, especially in the order of penalty takers, could have returned a completely different result and spared 18-year-old Smilla Holmberg from having to shoulder such responsibility when missing the final kick.Marsden: As Emily says, it's unforgivable that Sweden didn't practice spot kicks. Yes, there's an element of in-game pressure you can't plan for, but it's well-proven now that the old adage of \"it's a lottery\" is not true. At the tournament, there have been 24 of 41 penalties scored, which is a 58.5% conversion rate. It's 19/27 removing the England-Sweden game, though, for a 70.4% conversion rate. That's still lower than the 80% mark for most competitions -- 81.2% in the Women's Champions League last season -- but not hugely alarming. I think that shootout was just a freak event. That said, it does create more pressure on takers moving forward, although France and Germany responded quite well on Saturday.Laurens: Sam, who is our mathematician and stats guru, has provided the numbers. The one thing I noticed, which shows a lack of preparation or advice, is that most of Sweden and England players were taking their penalty very quickly after the referee blew her whistle. We know that to have the most chance to score, one of the things to do is to leave a few seconds after the ref's whistle, stay composed, breathe, focus and then shoot. Shooting straight away is never good!Lindop: I think all of these penalty misses serve as a reminder of just how high the pressure is when you get to this point in the tournament. Any mistake can be costly -- as Sweden found out on Thursday night. For both teams, it showed the importance of keeping a cool head when the stakes are high and of taking your chances. From a drama point of view, though, it certainly provided entertainment, and there were some super penalties in the shootout between France and Germany.Hamilton: It has to be nerves. I agree with the others that Sweden messed up by not practising penalties -- how they must regret that now. But the Germany-France game proved that a penalty shootout can be a more high-quality. Overall, England-Sweden was a freak event -- players like Alex Greenwood, who missed, are usually so reliable. But the in-game penalties are a combination of nerves, comprehensive analysis, superb goalkeepers and, in some instances, poor execution.play1:54England players react after dramatic penalty shootout winAlexa Russo, Lucy Bronze, Ella Toone and Chloe Kelly give their reaction following their dramatic penalty shootout win over Sweden at Euro 2025.What is one thing you haven't enjoyed at this Euros so far?Hamilton: The cost is extortionate. But also the 9 p.m. kickoffs. Far too late -- especially if you have extra time and penalties. A lovely 6 p.m. is ideal!Lindop: I'm going to be that annoying English person who complains about the heat! I'm not the biggest fan of hot weather, and I've struggled just walking around Switzerland at times, so massive kudos to the players for managing to deliver in such high temperatures. The tournament organizers have done a great job implementing provisions to keep everyone cool -- although I did have to pay nearly £7 for a bottle of water on one occasion!Keogh: I have to agree about the cost of things. On average, my morning coffee has cost me an eyewatering £6.28. Add that to the pricey nature of Zurich and the lack of media food provided by UEFA, it has been an expensive tournament. However, the free transport -- I am a big fan of the trams -- around matchdays, and the grab-and-go food from local supermarkets, have been a saving grace -- not only for ease but also for my bank account.Marsden: It's wrapping up too quickly! At the risk of going full UEFA or FIFA bigwig, could we be ready to mirror the men's 24-team group stage? I absolutely love knockout football and it feels like it's over so quickly in this format. There was a huge gap between Switzerland and Spain and they still put up a good fight. Imagine what Portugal, Denmark or Netherlands could have contributed in a round of 16. I think there is enough quality for the expansion to happen without losing too much from the group stage.Laurens: Nothing! I have been enjoying everything and I wouldn't change anything. I'd say the 9 p.m. kickoffs are the right time for big games at major tournaments -- isn't 6 p.m. the time when you have dinner as an Englishman, Tom? And heat is great! It's better than playing under the pouring rain like we have too often in England, Beth! And you were able to swim in the lake in Zurich, as well as getting a tan, I am sure! It is expensive, Emily, but then I am sure your coffee was the best you ever drank! I love knockout football, too, Samuel, but I am not sure 24 teams is the right call just now. Some teams, including Portugal, still have to improve.play1:23Keogh: Every team is beatable at Euro 2025Emily Keogh reacts to Spain's 2-0 win over Switzerland to secure a semifinal spot at Euro 2025.This is your chance to change your prediction for the final -- who will make it now?Hamilton: We've had our fair share of twists and turns so far, but I think this now goes to script. England should defeat Italy, and Germany are so depleted now for their semifinal with Spain that you have to fancy the reigning world champions. It'll be an England-Spain final.Keogh: Just because everyone will surely say England vs. Spain, I am going to root for the underdogs and say Italy vs. Germany. It's an implausible scenario, but we've seen crazier things happen in a tournament.Lindop: I'm still sticking with England vs Spain in a rematch of the 2023 World Cup final. Neither team looked anywhere near their best in the quarterfinals but they both still found a way which is the surest sign of champions.Laurens: I don't really trust this England side, who have not been good so far, but there is no way Italy can beat them. So the holders will have a chance to defend their title against Spain. It is boring but Germany, even with their mental strength and defensive mindset, have too many issues to be able to compete with the World Cup winners. And really, world champions vs European champions, the revenge of the last World Cup final, is the right final and the one we all wanted to see from the beginning.Marsden: I was impressed with how well Germany dug in a player light against France, while Italy will now be playing with a certain amount of freedom given they are the rank outsiders of the four teams left. So, with that I'm mind, I'm sticking with what I said after the group stages: Spain vs. England."

      "content": "Alden GonzalezJul 20, 2025, 07:00 AM ETCloseESPN baseball reporter. Covered the L.A. Rams for ESPN from 2016 to 2018 and the L.A. Angels for MLB.com from 2012 to 2016.Less than two years ago, the Texas Rangers rode a potent offense to the first World Series championship in franchise history. Since then -- on paper, at least -- that group has only improved. Established sluggers were brought in. Young, promising players accrued more seasoning. Core stars remained in their primes. And yet, over the course of 10 baseball months since hoisting the trophy on Nov. 1, 2023, the Rangers have fielded one of the sport's worst offenses, a sobering reality that continues to vex team officials.The circumstances of 2025 have only intensified the frustration.The Rangers have received Cy Young-caliber production from a rejuvenated Jacob deGrom, who had compiled fewer than 200 innings over the last four years. Their rotation went into the All-Star break with the second-lowest ERA in the major leagues. Their bullpen, practically rebuilt over one offseason, ranked third. Their defense (16 outs above average) was elite, as was their baserunning (10.8 runs above average). But the Rangers, despite back-to-back wins over the first-place Detroit Tigers this weekend, find themselves only a game over .500, seven games out of first place and 2 1/2 games out of a playoff spot, because they can't do the one thing they were expected to do best: hit.Bret Boone, the former All-Star second baseman who was installed as the team's hitting coach in early May, has been tasked with fixing that -- but he is also realistic.\"I'm not gonna come in here and 'abracadabra,'\" he said, waving his right arm as if wielding a magic wand. \"That's the big misnomer about hitting. Hitting is really hard. The bottom line is -- you can prepare as much as you want, but when you get in the box, it's just you and that pitcher.\"Boone isn't here for an overhaul. He's here to encourage. To simplify. One of his prevailing messages to players, he said, has been to \"watch the game\" -- to put away the tablet, come up to the dugout railing and see how opposing pitchers are attacking other hitters. Boone has emphasized the importance of approaching each game with a plan, whatever that might be. He has occasionally blocked off the indoor batting cage, worried that hitters of this generation swing too often. And he has encouraged conversation.\"That's what great offenses do,\" Boone said. \"They're constantly interacting.\"There might not be a more interesting team to watch ahead of the trade deadline. Rangers president of baseball operations Chris Young is not one to give up on a season, particularly with a team this talented. But one more rough patch might force him to, at least to an extent. Young would prefer to add, but it's hard to envision a way to improve the lineup from outside.He won't find a better middle-infield combo than Corey Seager and Marcus Semien. Or a better outfield than Evan Carter, Wyatt Langford and Adolis García. Or a better designated hitter than Joc Pederson, who could return from a hand fracture before the end of this month. Or a better catching tandem than Jonah Heim and Kyle Higashioka. Or a better crop of corner infielders than Josh Smith, Josh Jung and Jake Burger, though Burger returned to the injured list with a quad strain earlier this week.Any offensive improvement will probably come internally, signs of which emerged recently. The Rangers got Carter back from the bereavement list on July 4 and Langford back from the IL on July 5, making their lineup as close to whole as it has been all year. Over the ensuing week, they scored 53 runs in seven games heading into the All-Star break. Maybe it was a sign of things to come. Or, if recent history is any indication, a short burst of false promise.Below is a look at five numbers that define the Rangers' surprising offensive downturn.1. Semien and Seager's combined OPS on June 22: .671The Rangers' rise began in late November 2021, just before the sport shut down in the leadup to an ugly labor fight, when Semien and Seager secured contracts totaling $500 million. Their deals came within days of each other, ensuring they'd share a middle infield for years to come. And when the Rangers won it all in 2023, it was Semien and Seager hitting back-to-back at the top of the lineup, setting the tone for an offense that overwhelmed teams in October.Some things haven't changed: Semien and Seager are still the driving forces of this offense. For most of this year, though, that hasn't been a positive thing.As late as June 22, with the Rangers 78 games into their season, Semien and Seager had combined for a .229/.312/.359 slash line. Their combined OPS, .671, sat 44 points below the league average.Semien, traditionally a slow starter, finished the month of May with the second-lowest slugging percentage among qualified hitters and at times batted ninth. Seager made two separate trips to the IL because of the same right hamstring strain and eventually fell out of whack, batting .188 in June. If the Rangers are looking for good news, though, it's that Semien and Seager finally got going in the leadup to the All-Star break. From June 23 to July 13 -- with Seager and Semien settling into the No. 2 and No. 3 spots, respectively -- they slashed .313/.418/.592.\"We all want to be on at the same time,\" Semien said. \"It'll never happen like that, but if Corey and I are on, this team goes.\"2. Texas' slash line against fastballs: .236/.312/.372One of the Rangers' coaches recently recalled some of the most iconic homers from the team's championship run -- García's grand slam in the American League Championship Series, and Seager's blasts against Houston's Cristian Javier and Arizona's Paul Sewald.They all had one thing in common: turning on high fastballs and pulverizing them.The Rangers were one of the best fastball-hitting teams in 2023. That has been far from the case since. The Rangers slashed just .233/.315/.379 against four-seam fastballs in 2024, worse than every team except the Chicago White Sox, who lost a record 121 games. This year, it isn't much better.The Rangers' slash line against four-seamers was only .236/.312/.372 heading into the All-Star break, good for a .684 OPS that ranked 27th in the majors. Burger (.473 OPS), Heim (.500), Pederson (.620) and García (.660) were especially vulnerable. Against four-seamers that were elevated, no team had a higher swing-and-miss percentage than Texas (55.5%).Being in position to hit the fastball has been one of the points of emphasis from the hitting coaches in recent weeks. It doesn't mean every hitter will look fastball first -- approaches are individualistic and often alter based on matchups -- but it does underscore the importance of narrowing the focus. Opposing pitchers are too good these days. Hitters can't account for everything. And the best offenses are able to take something away from an opposing pitching staff. The 2023 team took away the fastball as an attack weapon. But the Rangers, in the words of one staffer, have been \"stuck in between\" ever since -- late on velocity and off balance against spin.It's a tough way to live.3. Rangers' chase rate with RISP: 32.2%When asked about the biggest difference between the 2023 offense and the 2025 version, Rangers manager Bruce Bochy mentioned the approach in run-scoring opportunities. The team from two years ago, he said, was much better at situational hitting with runners in scoring position. This team seems to chase too much in those situations.The numbers bear that out.The Rangers' chase percentage with runners in scoring position was 32.2% coming out of the All-Star break, fourth worst in the major leagues. Their strikeout percentage, 23.7%, was fifth worst. Their slash line, .230/.304/.357, was down there with some of the worst teams in the sport. The Rangers' lineup has some strikeout in it -- with Burger, Jung and García at the top of that list -- but team officials believe it should be much better adept at driving in runs.Not being able to has led to some dramatic highs and lows. The Rangers have scored eight or more runs 13 times, including two instances over a 72-hour stretch in which they hung 16 runs on the Minnesota Twins. But there have also been 25 games in which they have been held to one or zero runs, third most in the major leagues.4. Carter's and Jung's wOBA ranks since 2023: 205th and 264thEntering the second half, 380 players had accumulated at least 300 plate appearances since the start of the 2024 season. Among them, Carter ranked 205th with a .308 weighted on-base average. Jung, with a .295 wOBA, ranked 264th.Jung looked like a budding star at third base in 2023, making the All-Star team and finishing fourth in AL Rookie of the Year voting. Carter came up in September and surged throughout October. With those two and Langford, Texas' draft pick at No. 4 earlier that summer, the Rangers had three young, controllable players they could surround with their long list of established stars. It seemed unfair, yet it hasn't come close to panning out.Carter struggled through the first two months of 2024, was diagnosed with a stress reaction in his back, couldn't fully ramp back up, got shut down for good in August, didn't look right the following spring training and started the 2025 season in Triple-A. Carter appeared in just 45 games in 2024. Jung played in only one more, after a wrist fracture held him out for most of the first four months.Then came a stretch of 101 plate appearances this June during which Jung notched just 15 hits, 5 walks and 27 strikeouts. Eight of those strikeouts came over his last four games, when his chase rate jumped to 45.9% -- 12 percentage points above his career average. A Rangers source described him as \"defeated\" and \"lost.\"On the second day of July, Jung was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock.5. Rangers' wRC+ since 2023: 94There might not be a better representation of the Rangers' drop-off than weighted runs created plus, which attempts to quantify total offensive value by gathering every relevant statistic, assigning each its proper weight and synthesizing it all into one convenient, park- and league-adjusted metric. The league average is 100, with every tick above or below representing a percentage point better or worse than the rest of the sport at that time.During the 2023 regular season, the Rangers put together 117 wRC+. In other words, their offense was 17% above league average. Only one team -- the Atlanta Braves, another currently underperforming club -- was better. From the start of the 2024 season to the start of the 2025 All-Star break, the Rangers compiled a 94 wRC+, putting them 6% below the league average. Only eight teams were worse.Five every-day players from that 2023 team are still on the Rangers -- not counting Carter, who didn't come up until September -- and all of them have seen their OPS drop by more than 100 points. Seager? 1.013 OPS in 2023, .856 OPS since. García? .836 in 2023, .681 since. Heim? .755 in 2023, .605 since. Semien? .826 in 2023, .693 since. Jung? .781 in 2023, .676 since.For Young, it's not just the individual performances but how they coalesce.\"What we had was just a really balanced approach and a collective mindset in terms of the way we were attacking the opposing pitcher,\" Young, in his fifth season as the head of baseball operations, said of the 2023 offense. \"We had other guys who could grind out at-bats. We had guys who could hit for average. We had guys who slugged. And I still think we have that in our lineup. It's just, for whatever reason, a number of them have had bad years to start the season. When you have a couple guys having down years, you can survive. When you have a majority of them having down years, it's magnified. And then guys start pressing and putting pressure on themselves, and it makes it even harder.\""

      "category": "baseball",
      "content": "Multiple ContributorsJul 18, 2025, 07:00 AM ETThe baseball world gathered in Atlanta for the 2025 MLB draft, Home Run Derby and All-Star Game this week, and our baseball reporters were there talking to execs, coaches, agents, scouts, players and other team sources.While fans are focused on the excitement on the field, behind the scenes, it's a great time to collect intel on what teams are thinking with the MLB trade deadline fast approaching and get the pulse of the sport on the topics dominating the season.Our reporters emptied their notebooks with the latest news and rumors. Who are the big names to watch at the trade deadline (July 31 at 6 p.m. ET)? What's the latest buzz on the biggest free agent? And which teams and storylines will rule the second half? Here's everything we heard during the festivities in Atlanta.Who will be the biggest name to move at the MLB trade deadline?Jeff Passan: Now that Boston is firmly in playoff contention, Alex Bregman is almost certainly off the table. With Milwaukee cruising, Freddy Peralta would no longer seem to be part of an add-subtract plan for the Brewers. Which leaves the biggest name as ... the guy with the worst ERA in MLB among all pitchers with at least 90 innings. And yet Sandy Alcantara, he of the 7.22 ERA, remains a target for teams thanks to the quality of his stuff and paucity of big available names.Some teams see Alcantara's contract as too big an impediment and complain that the Miami Marlins want too much in return for him. That's fine. Teams are twitchy. They crave upside. With the deadline creeping ever closer, the prospect of a team surveying the starting-pitching landscape and being willing to give up real talent for Alcantara's upside is tangible. Perhaps Alcantara is packaged with another Marlin to give the acquiring club a modicum of stability amid questions of whether the former NL Cy Young winner can be fixed.Buster Olney: The Arizona Diamondbacks have indicated to other teams that they will probably be dealers -- and assuming that's how it plays out, they will be a central player leading up to this year's trade deadline. All-Star third baseman Eugenio Suarez will likely be the most coveted position player moved before the deadline, with the Seattle Mariners and New York Yankees (and perhaps other clubs) pursuing him. First baseman Josh Naylor is having a good season, hitting .294 with 11 homers, and is an experienced run producer who might fit the San Francisco Giants or Mariners.The Minnesota Twins also could play into this question. A lot of the deals this time of year are for relievers, and the perception of other teams is that Minnesota could be a primary source with a lot to offer -- hard-throwing closer Jhoan Duran, left-hander Danny Coulombe or setup man Griffin Jax. One rival executive believes that All-Star starter Joe Ryan will be moved before the deadline, but two others disagree, saying that their perception is that the Twins would have to be overwhelmed to part with the right-hander.It's been an up-and-down July for the two N.Y. teams: What are the Yankees and Mets most likely to do at the deadline?Jorge Castillo: Brian Cashman was about as transparent as a front office executive dares in the week entering the All-Star break: \"We're going to go to town. We're going to do everything we possibly can to improve ourselves and try to match up.\" He also made his objectives plain. The Yankees will prioritize pitching, first in the rotation then in the bullpen with a reliever or two, followed by an infielder, preferably a third baseman to upgrade over Oswald Peraza. Checking off all those boxes will not be simple, but Cashman appears willing to operate aggressively to tangibly bolster the roster and give the Yankees a real shot to return to the World Series -- and not waste another magnificent Aaron Judge season. That could mean making everyone in the farm system besides top prospect George Lombard Jr. available.As for the Mets, the bullpen is atop the checklist, and adding a starter and center fielder is possible. The relief corps has faced two obstacles: Injuries and heavy usage caused by the rotation ranking 22nd in the majors in innings pitched. All-Star closer Edwin Diaz was consistently dominant, but other pillars, including Reed Garrett (39 appearances), Ryne Stanek (37) and Huascar Brazobán (39), have stumbled in spots. Injuries have decimated the rotation -- Griffin Canning (Achilles) is out for the season, and Tylor Megill (elbow) and Paul Blackburn (shoulder) are on the injured list -- but the need for a starter could be mitigated if Sean Manaea and Kodai Senga return to their usual forms after each was activated from the injured list the final weekend before the All-Star break. Otherwise, center field is an obvious position to upgrade if David Stearns finds a price he's comfortable paying.Jesse Rogers:  There isn't much mystery to the Yankees. Brian Cashman could use a reliever and a third baseman followed by starting pitching coming in third among his needs. If Suarez isn't traded or is too expensive, then Colorado Rockies infielder Ryan McMahon is another possibility. Meanwhile, the Mets aren't getting much production out of center field, making Luis Robert Jr an intriguing fit. The Mets are also looking for bullpen help, considering their injuries on the mound.Olney: The Mets' rotation could be in its best state in the coming weeks, with Sean Manaea now back, so they probably wouldn't make a deal for starting pitching depth. But if there's a trade to be made for someone who could start the first three games of a postseason series (which is the way that some evaluators distinguish starting pitchers at this time of year), the Mets could be interested in someone like Merrill Kelly or Zac Gallen, who could be two of the best starting pitchers moved before the deadline.One evaluator believes that Kansas City Royals starter Seth Lugo (who started his career with the Mets) is a natural target for the Mets or Yankees, as they're both big-market teams with resources to burn and a potential willingness to overpay.However, rival execs say the hallmark of president of baseball operations David Stearns' work is that he won't overpay early, but rather, he will wait for something more reasonable to emerge. \"In the end,\" said one executive with another team, \"he'll make multiple trades that improve the team -- deals that might not be the splashiest, but good deals.\"The Mets will track the center-field options closely, with that position being the most obvious spot to upgrade. Could Baltimore's Cedric Mullins represent an upgrade? The White Sox's Luis Robert Jr.? Is Boston's Jarren Duran actually available? These are questions to be answered in the Mets' front office.Which contenders will go really big at the deadline?Passan: The Chicago Cubs need a starting pitcher. And while other teams' needs are more urgent -- the Phillies' bullpen, third base for the Yankees and plenty more -- the Cubs are in an extremely strong position.They have the best run differential in baseball and the third-easiest schedule for the remainder of the season. Home-field advantage is within reach. The Cubs need a starter for innings, sure, but more than that because their playoff rotation at the moment has a gaping hole. Shota Imanaga and Matthew Boyd have pitched their way into two spots, but Chicago needs a similar caliber starter who it simply doesn't have at the moment.Alden Gonzalez: The Phillies have championship hopes, an aging core, an ultra-aggressive front office and a clear need ahead of the trade deadline: bullpen help. Phillies relievers combined for a 4.38 ERA heading into the All-Star break, tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the seventh-highest mark in the major leagues.Rival executives expect those two teams to be among the most aggressive in pursuit of high-leverage arms over these next few weeks.Another team to watch is the Toronto Blue Jays, who surged to the top of the American League East with 25 wins in their last 38 games before the break. They didn't lavish Vladimir Guerrero Jr. with $500 million for nothing. They'll do whatever it takes to augment the group around him.Olney: There are a couple more interesting teams to watch. The Mariners' focus is on adding offense at first and third base. They had almost no payroll flexibility over the most recent offseason, but the perception is that they will have money to spend at this year's deadline -- and might prefer to take on some payroll rather than overpay in prospect capital. The Mariners, with a good farm system, would seem to have a lot of common denominators for deal-making with the Diamondbacks.The Rays are typically one of the more creative clubs at the deadline, sometimes acquiring talent and sometimes trading it away -- and sometimes doing both. But news broke in recent days that the sale of the franchise is moving forward, and there is a perception in other front offices that the Rays might be given the freedom (a wink-wink from incoming ownership) to be more aggressive than usual and spend money. But they have to play better to justify a move like that.What's the latest on Kyle Tucker's free agency?Rogers: It's quiet. Very quiet. His current team -- the Cubs -- is likely to come to him with a good offer at some point, but it probably won't be for max dollars. Then he'll likely hear from the big boys in free agency (minus the Mets, who signed Juan Soto last offseason). From there, he will have a decision: Sign back up in Chicago where he looks comfortable or hit one of the coasts for the next megadeal. He could always keep a Cubs offer in his back pocket and circle back to them. One thing he has going for him: Cubs fans want him back.The team to beat in each league right now is ...?Gonzalez: The Dodgers, even still, for one clear reason: They entered the All-Star break with the National League's best record, and their best baseball might still be in front of them. Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts have not hit to their capabilities. Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow are just now getting healthy again. Shohei Ohtani is in the early stages of being built back up as a starting pitcher.The Dodgers might not challenge the regular-season wins record, but in the eyes of many throughout the sport, they also haven't done anything to make one believe they can't repeat as champions. It will come down to how they upgrade their bullpen and whether they can keep their starting pitchers healthy, something they have proved incapable of doing these past couple of years.Castillo: Right now, it's the Tigers -- though that could change after the trade deadline. Detroit has the best record in the league with the best pitcher in the league (Tarik Skubal) leading one of the best rotations in the league, though adding a starter is within reason after Jackson Jobe was lost for the season and Alex Cobb still hasn't thrown a pitch in 2025. The offense, while without that one MVP-level superstar, had three All-Stars and ranks third in the American League with a 110 wRC+.If there are areas that could use improvement for October, it's the bullpen and third base. Detroit relievers rank 11th in the AL in ERA and sixth in win probability added, and Tigers third basemen have combined for an 86 wRC+ this season. Even without bolstering those areas, the Tigers should run away with the AL Central and could earn home-field advantage throughout the postseason.What other intel did you hear during All-Star week?Olney: The Cleveland Guardians are ready to listen to offers for all but four players -- third baseman Jose Ramirez, outfielder Steven Kwan and relievers Emmanuel Clase and Cade Smith. Everyone else is available, with the Guardians hoping to get maximum value and find more offense.Rogers: Scouts are keeping a close eye on the Twins because Minnesota could have pitching to move in the coming weeks. The same can't be said of the Royals, who keep telling folks they aren't breaking up their team despite a middling record. AL Central teams are in a different position than they were a year ago when the division was up for grabs. Detroit will likely be the only team in the division to add anything of significance.Olney: The Texas Rangers are among this deadline's mystery teams -- it's unclear whether they are dealing or acquiring. \"I think what they do coming out of the All-Star break is going to be really important,\" one evaluator said. If the Rangers do decide to trade away talent, however, they could make some more measured moves. Jacob deGrom and Nathan Eovaldi are not considered to be in play, at least by some other teams; Adolis Garcia, on the other hand, could be.Castillo: The Rockies, potentially breaking from previous years, are listening to calls and ready to make moves, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. They have big league talent to offer contenders. Third baseman Ryan McMahon, starters German Marquez and Austin Gomber, and reliever Jake Bird could all impact playoff races.Colorado's insular front office in recent years has traded fewer major leaguers than you'd expect from an organization in its position -- without a playoff berth since 2018, on pace for the worst season ever and with a farm system that ranks in the bottom half in most public rankings -- but that could change this month."

Voepel began covering women's basketball in 1984, and has been with ESPN since 1996.Jul 20, 2025, 01:14 AM ETINDIANAPOLIS -- Napheesa Collier was the biggest of the All-Stars on Saturday as her Team Collier beat Team Clark 151-131 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. The Minnesota Lynx forward scored an All-Star Game-record 36 points as her squad dominated throughout.The players spent a lot of the weekend sending a message that they want to get paid more by the league, as both sides are in the midst of collective bargaining. The city of Indianapolis embraced hosting the game, and the fans showed out in full force despite team captain Caitlin Clark being sidelined by injury.Much more dialogue will come throughout the rest of this season on labor negotiations, and the injury status of marquee players such as Clark will be a continuing topic.But here, we grade the individual performances of the 22 All-Stars on the court (and Friday's participants in the 3-point contest and the skills challenge). Indianapolis gets an A-plus for all it did to publicize the game and turn downtown into a celebratory space. Which players got the other top grades?Jump to: Team Collier | Team Clark | 3-point contest | Skills challengeplay0:16Team Collier dazzles with creative three-player layup sequenceTeam Collier gets crafty with a behind-the-back assist and a wraparound pass that leads to a smooth finish at the rim.Winners: Team CollierNapheesa Collier, F, Minnesota Lynx\nGrade: A+This was as close to a one-woman show as an All-Star Game could be for MV-Phee. She was 13-of-16 from the field and 6-of-6 from the foul line. This game doesn't count toward regular-season stats, but Collier is shooting 94.6% (105-of-111) from the free throw line this season. Collier, who leads the league in scoring (23.2 points per game), is the season MVP favorite for the first-place Lynx. So, perhaps Saturday was just a prelude to her picking up that trophy in a couple of months.Skylar Diggins, G, Seattle Storm\nGrade: A+A native of South Bend, Indiana, Notre Dame legend Diggins was terrific in the All-Star Game back in her home state. She had the first triple-double -- 11 points, 11 rebounds and 15 assists -- in WNBA All-Star Game history and seemed to have a great time doing it. Diggins, making her seventh All-Star Game appearance, is averaging 17.5 points and 5.8 assists this season for the Storm.Kelsey Plum, G, Los Angeles Sparks\nGrade: APlum had a hot start and for a while looked as if she might contend for MVP, before Collier ran away with it. The longtime Las Vegas Aces star now in her first season in Los Angeles finished with 16 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists. And she gets extra credit for some of fun antics, such as guarding former Aces teammate A'ja Wilson all the way down the sidelines and out of bounds on one comical sequence in the first half.Nneka Ogwumike, F, Seattle Storm\nGrade: AShe was nearly perfect from the field -- going 7-for-8 -- and that included 2-of-2 from behind the arc. Ogwumike had a career-high 30 3-pointers last season, and she is sure to break that mark this year with 27 on the season already. The 10-time All-Star also had seven rebounds and three assists.Allisha Gray, G, Atlanta Dream\nGrade: B+Last year's double winner of the 3-point contest and skills challenge competed in both events again this season. That's impressive, even if she didn't successfully defend either title. Then Gray, who is averaging a career-high 18.4 PPG this season, put up 18 points Saturday, going 5-of-12 from behind the 3-point arc.Courtney Williams, G, Minnesota Lynx\nGrade: B+Williams and her Lynx \"Studbudz\" teammate Natisha Hiedeman made the most of being everywhere and enjoying everything on All-Star Weekend. So, Williams gets extra credit for that. She also had work to do: Williams competed in the skills challenge and in Saturday's All-Star Game, in which she finished with 13 points, 5 assists and 2 rebounds.Paige Bueckers, G, Dallas Wings\nGrade: BIn her first All-Star Game, the Rookie of the Year favorite and No. 1 draft pick made her mark by facilitating, just as Clark did last season. Bueckers had eight assists to go along with six points.Alyssa Thomas, F, Phoenix Mercury\nGrade: BThis might seem like a high grade considering Thomas had just six points. But consider how efficient she was: 3-of-4 from the field, 4 rebounds, 4 assists and plus-14 in 13 minutes of play. Thomas, the face of the Connecticut Sun for so long, has become a favorite of Phoenix's X-Factor fan base and has helped make the Mercury a potential title contender.Kayla McBride, G, Minnesota Lynx\nGrade: B-A replacement player for Atlanta's Rhyne Howard, \"McBuckets\" is another player with Indiana connections, as she also starred at Notre Dame. McBride helped lead the Lynx to the WNBA Finals last year, and she is a big part of them being in first place now. She posted 15 points Saturday, but she gets dinged a little for going 4-of-12 from the fieldBreanna Stewart, F, New York Liberty\nGrade: B-It was a fairly quiet All-Star Game for Stewart, who won her third WNBA title last year and is trying to help the Liberty repeat. Stewart went 4-of-8 from the field for 8 points to go with 4 rebounds and 2 assists. But she gets extra credit for passing to injured Rhyne Howard on the bench and allowing her to take a shot.Angel Reese, F, Chicago Sky\nGrade: B-Reese, the league's leading rebounder, had just six points, but she still grades in the Bs thanks to nine rebounds and finishing plus-17 in her 17 minutes of play. Plus, Team Collier was so good that we just don't think anyone should get an average grade. -- Michael VoepelLosers: Team ClarkKelsey Mitchell, G, Indiana Fever\nGrade: AThe Fever fan favorite has been on an efficient scoring run in the regular season that carried over to the All-Star Game. She led Team Clark with 20 points on 8-of-13 shooting and also tallied 2 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals. And no one has more of an appreciation for the resurgence of the Fever franchise than Mitchell, who is in her eighth season in Indiana and has seen the best of times blossom after the worst.Kiki Iriafen, F, Washington Mystics\nGrade: AThe rookie and No. 4 draft pick was dynamic and fun in her first All-Star appearance, getting a double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds. She was 7-of-15 from the field. Iriafen has been a big part of the Mystics' better-than-expected 11-11 season.Kayla Thornton, F, Golden State Valkyries\nGrade: AIn her 10th campaign, Thornton is having a career year as she has helped launch the Valkyries expansion franchise. This was her first All-Star Game appearance, and she made the most of it with 15 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists.Gabby Williams, F, Seattle Storm\nGrade: A-Making her first All-Star appearance in her seventh WNBA season, Williams made her presence felt. She finished with 16 points and five assists. Her talent on defense wasn't on display at the All-Star Game, but expect it back as soon as the regular season resumes.Brionna Jones, F, Atlanta Dream\nGrade: B+Jones is known for her quiet, dependable efficiency, and that described her in this All-Star Game. She played just 12 minutes but went 5-of-6 from the field for 11 points while adding 3 rebounds and 3 assists. A replacement player for Satou Sabally, Jones capitalized on her opportunity. And she has been a very good addition to the Dream this season.Sabrina Ionescu, G, New York Liberty\nGrade: B+Ionescu made a huge contribution to All-Star Weekend with another exciting performance in winning the 3-point competition, and we want to give her some extra credit for that here. On Saturday, she was 4-of-8 from the field for 12 points to go with seven assists.Aliyah Boston, F, Indiana Fever\nGrade: B-She has been a tower of strength for the Fever since she was drafted No. 1 here in 2023. So, it was nice to see Boston get a lot of love from the Gainbridge Fieldhouse crowd for this game as she posted 9 points, 6 rebounds and 2 assists.Sonia Citron, G, Washington Mystics\nGrade: B-Like Iriafen, No. 3 draft pick Citron got a chance to be an All-Star as a rookie. She also took part in the 3-point shooting contest Friday, and Sabrina Ionescu shared part of her 3-point winnings with her. Citron registered 11 points, 2 assists and 2 rebounds in the All-Star Game.Brittney Sykes, G, Washington Mystics\nGrade: B-Sykes was the replacement for Caitlin Clark and had an overall good night -- except for behind the arc, where she was 0-for-9. Still, Sykes had 16 points, 7 assists and 3 rebounds. This season, she has been a good mentor for fellow All-Stars Citron and Iriafen, who are rookies with the Mystics.A'ja Wilson, F, Las Vegas Aces\nGrade: CThe three-time MVP has dealt with some injury issues this season and didn't want to play a lot in the All-Star Game. She was in for 12 minutes and finished 2-of-4 from the field for 4 points to go with 2 rebounds and 2 assists. Now, it's back to trying to figure out how to help bring more consistency for the 11-11 Aces.Jackie Young, G, Las Vegas Aces\nGrade: NoneThe two-time WNBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist -- back in her native state of Indiana, where she grew up in Princeton then starred at Notre Dame -- played just one minute due to dealing with an injury. -- Voepelplay1:49Sabrina Ionescu 'redeems herself' after loss to Steph CurrySabrina Ionescu jokes with Holly Rowe about redeeming herself to win her second WNBA 3-point contest.3-point contestFriday's festivities had a New York flavor. The Liberty's Sabrina Ionescu won the 3-point shooting contest for the second time in three years, while teammate Natasha Cloud took home the skills challenge title.It's the second time in WNBA history that players from the same team have won both competitions, which have been held at every All-Star Game since 2019, but the first time that has happened with two different players. In 2024, Allisha Gray of the Atlanta Dream won both competitions, but she was unable to successfully defend either title Friday.Sabrina Ionescu, New York Liberty\nGrade: AAfter sitting out last year, Ionescu returned to show why she and four-time winner Allie Quigley are the only acceptable answers for the WNBA's 3-point contest GOAT.For anyone else, Ionescu's score of 25 in the first round -- tied for second best of the night -- would have been a highlight. Ionescu made 13 of her last 16 shot attempts, including a deep 3. For Ionescu, that was just a warmup.In the final, Ionescu missed her first two shots and her last three, which led her to say she was \"pretty disappointed\" because she \"missed a few easy ones.\" Everyone else was amazed by Ionescu making 11 consecutive shots at one point, including the deep 3, reminiscent of her record score of 37 during the 2023 final.Ionescu settled for a 30-point round, giving her two of the three times WNBA players have scored 30-plus in the 3-point contest since the current format was adopted in 2021. Quigley, with a round of 30 in the finals, was fittingly the other player to reach that mark.Allisha Gray, Atlanta Dream\nGrade: A-Going last as the defending champ, Gray set up the anticipated showdown of the past two winners by making four shots and the money ball from each of the last three racks. That tied Ionescu's score of 25 in the opening round. Gray got on a similar roll from the left wing in the finals, going 5-for-5 after making the deep 3 from that side, but it was already too late to catch Ionescu. Gray missed her first four shots of the finals and went 0-of-5 from the top of the key. Gray's score of 22 points in the finals nonetheless matched the best round by anyone but her and Ionescu.Kelsey Plum, Los Angeles Sparks\nGrade: BThe middle of Plum's round put her in the early lead. She made three from the top of the key, the right deep 3 and four of five from the right wing. Had Plum made her final shot, worth two points, she would have made things really interesting for the two finalists. Instead, Plum finished third behind the two previous champions.Sonia Citron, Washington Mystics\nGrade: B-The lone rookie in the field might have needed to move her money ball rack. Citron made four of her high-arching shots from the left wing and all five from the top of the key but went 1-of-5 from the right wing with double points for all shots. Simply flipping the two wings would have given Citron a couple more points and pushed her out of last place. For that spot, Citron's score was more than respectable.Lexie Hull, Indiana Fever\nGrade: B-The Fever's only player to compete Friday was a late replacement for teammate Caitlin Clark, who had to withdraw due to injury. Early on, it looked like Hull's shot -- reliant on a large vertical jump -- might not translate to the 3-point contest. She had just three points through the first two racks before making one of the deep 3s. Hull caught fire down the stretch, making eight of her last 10 shots -- including four of five from the money ball rack -- but it wasn't enough to reach the finals. -- Kevin Peltonplay1:24Natasha Cloud beats buzzer to win WNBA Skills ChallengeNatasha Cloud beats the buzzer with 1.1 seconds to spare, edging Erica Wheeler's 37.5 to win the WNBA All-Star Skills Challenge.Skills challengeNatasha Cloud, New York Liberty\nGrade: AI thought Cloud was out of the finals after she needed all three attempts on both 3-point shots, but she managed to race through the final pass and the hoop for a layup just ahead of Erica Wheeler's time of 37.5 seconds. Cloud ended with the night's two best times, displaying a mastery of both skill and the strategy that can separate winners from losers in the skills challenge.play0:16Team Collier dazzles with creative three-player layup sequenceTeam Collier gets crafty with a behind-the-back assist and a wraparound pass that leads to a smooth finish at the rim.Erica Wheeler, Seattle Storm\nGrade: A-The longtime member of the Indiana Fever got a huge cheer from the crowd when she referred to her home-court advantage in the competition. It looked like that might be enough to carry the 2019 All-Star MVP to victory, overcoming a gaffe in the opening round. Focusing on fundamentals and making her first shot or pass, Wheeler had enough cushion to advance even though she smoked her first layup attempt. In the finals, Wheeler set the bar for Cloud, but slowing down when she needed multiple attempts at the above-the-break 3-pointer cost her.Allisha Gray, Atlanta Dream\nGrade: B-The defending champ, Gray moved quickly through the course -- perhaps too fast for her own good. Gray was already trying to move on to the next station when she missed her first chest pass and had to double back. Gray needed all three attempts, leaving her too far behind to reach the final round despite strong shooting.Courtney Williams, Minnesota Lynx\nGrade: CAfter a strong start with bounce passes, Williams wasn't clean enough the rest of the round. Williams needed multiple attempts on her outlet passes and shots, leaving her with a score of 42.0 seconds that surpassed only Diggins. Ahead of playing in Saturday's All-Star Game, that left Williams time to focus on her livestream with Natisha Hiedeman.Skylar Diggins, Seattle Storm\nGrade: C-Diggins' opening round reflected an issue with the skills challenge rules that the NBA and WNBA haven't rectified after the San Antonio Spurs were disqualified at NBA All-Star Saturday Night for attempting to exploit it. Because players move on with no penalty after three missed shots (or passes), there's no actual benefit to making the last shot -- as Diggins did from all three locations. The time Diggins spent on those attempts doomed her to the first round's slowest time. -- Pelton"

(1:57)ESPNJul 19, 2025, 11:10 PM ETTeam Collier is your WNBA All-Star Game winner! After a thrilling night filled with deep 4-pointers, broken records and lighthearted fun, Team Collier emerged victorious in Indianapolis with a 151-130 win over Team Clark.The evening was highlighted by Skylar Diggins, who made history as the first WNBA player to notch a triple-double in an All-Star Game. Napheesa Collier also delivered a standout performance, dropping 36 points to lead her team to triumph.Despite captain Caitlin Clark being sidelined due to injury, Team Clark had fun on the court, and both squads shared plenty of laughs while bonding over their love of the game, their love of winning and, perhaps most importantly, their love of GloRilla, the halftime performer.Here are some of our favorite moments from the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game.Jump to:\nTop moments | Relive the All-Star GameTop moments from the WNBA All-Star Gameplay0:16Napheesa Collier sinks smooth 4-point jumperNapheesa Collier nonchalantly knocks down a deep 4-pointer off a pass from the arc.Alexa Philippou: Napheesa Collier's (continued) coronation as the best player in the WNBA. In her player intro before the game, Collier imitated putting a crown on her head. Queen Phee showed herself to be just that Saturday night, as she has throughout this past year, from the 2024 WNBA playoffs to the inaugural Unrivaled season to her 2025 campaign with the Minnesota Lynx in which she is the MVP front-runner.Collier's 36 points established a WNBA All-Star Game record. For the third straight year, we've seen history made in the big game with players setting the scoring record: Jewell Loyd and Breanna Stewart had 31 points apiece in 2023, Arike Ogunbowale reached 34 in 2024 and now Collier with 36.Michael Voepel: Back in her home state of Indiana, South Bend native and Notre Dame legend Skylar Diggins seemed to really enjoy her All-Star Game outing -- and we enjoyed watching her. She registered the WNBA All-Star Game's first triple-double -- 11 points, 11 rebounds (tied for the most in an All-Star Game with Kayla Thornton) and 15 assists (an All-Star Game record) -- in helping lead Team Collier to victory. Diggins, who will turn 35 in August, is playing ageless basketball, and it's great to see.Kendra Andrews: The highlight of the All-Star Game for me has to be Kelsey Plum's first half, and not just her 14 points. Plum's antics on the court -- grabbing A'ja Wilson and running down the court with her arms wrapped around her as well as taking a dramatic pause before shooting a reverse layup around Collier -- are what make the All-Star game fun.Plum's zesty personality shines through in the best ways in this environment and is a reminder that this game is supposed to allow the players to have fun and not take themselves too seriously. Of course, it helps that she still got buckets.Katie Barnes: A highlight of the game for me has to be Rhyne Howard stepping in from the bench to take a corner 3-pointer. Injuries have been a prominent storyline surrounding this All-Star Game (Howard was one of the players on the injury list), and it was great to see her enjoy a fun moment, even though the ball didn't drop through. I love when All-Star Games embrace fun and celebratory silliness, and that moment ticked all those boxes.Relive the All-Star Game"

      "content": "<p>Jose Ramirez is now a seven-time MLB All-Star, and he's well-established as one of the greatest players in franchise history in his 13th season with the Cleveland Guardians. The 32-year-old is having another sensational season, slashing .298/.368/.523 with 19 home runs, 52 RBI and 29 stolen bases. He's hitting .352 against left-handed pitching this season and he'll have a matchup with Athletics lefty Jeffrey Springs on Sunday, which is why our model is declaring Ramirez over 1.5 total bases (+100) as one of its top MLB prop picks. With all 30 teams in action, there are hundreds of MLB player props to wager on through various MLB betting sites.

He's well on his way to a 10th in 2025 and the extra-base machine has been on a tear of late. Ramirez has a homer, a triple and a double in his last two games and he's had at least four total bases in seven of his last 12 games. New users can even take advantage of the FanDuel promo code offering $150 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins. Click here to claim the offer. Tarik Skubal, Tigers, Over 1.5 earned runs allowed (+103)  Skubal looks like he's well on his way to a second consecutive AL Cy Young award, but he has given up at least two earned runs on eight occasions this year and has done so in three of his last five starts. He gave up four earned runs in his last outing against the Mariners, and now he'll take on a Rangers offense that has been a bit disappointing this season but still features some tough outs. The model predicts that Skubal gives up a couple of earned runs on Sunday, and new users can use the latest Caesars Sportsbook promo code, which allows you to double your winnings on 10 bets after your first $1 bet.</p>\n\n<p>Merrill Kelly, Diamondbacks, Under 17.5 outs recorded (+130)He'll become a free agent in 2026 and with the Diamondbacks disappointing, every start is likely an audition for Kelly going forward. However, the Arizona front office will probably want the coaching staff to be relatively conservative with one of their biggest trade assets. Kelly only went five innings despite giving up one hit and one earned run in his last start because four walks drove his pitch count up to 98. He's had eight starts this year where he hasn't completed the sixth inning and he's gone under in this market in four of his last five home games.

The Mariners can complete the series sweep on Sunday, and they'll send Bryan Woo to the mound, who was an AL all-star this year after posting an 8-4 record with a 2.75 ERA and 109 strikeouts over 114 2/3 innings in the first half.

      "content": "Gabriel says things will be 'different' at Arsenal 'after letting titles slip'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gabriel Magalhaes is working to be fit for the new season BBC Sport football news reporterGabriel Magalhaes believes this season \"will be different\" for Arsenal after admitting they have \"let a couple of titles slip through our fingers\" in recent years.Mikel Arteta has transformed the Gunners since taking over almost six years ago, but they have not won major silverware since FA Cup success in 2020 - his first season in charge.The Gunners have finished second in the Premier League for three successive years and lost in the semi-finals of both the Champions League and Carabao Cup last season - to eventual winners Paris St-Germain and Newcastle respectively.As Arsenal begin their pre-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong, BBC Sport looks at the changes that needed to be made in an attempt to lift a trophy for the first time in five years.The need to avoid lengthy lay-offsKai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli all spent lengthy spells on the sidelines last season, which disrupted Arsenal's attack. Striker Gabriel Jesus also missed a large part of the campaign with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and - with other recognised attackers out - midfielder Mikel Merino ended up playing as a makeshift centre-forward. Merino did well - scoring seven times in 28 Premier League games and hitting an important goal in the victory over Real Madrid in the Champions League - but Arteta will want to avoid such a scenario this season. It wasn't all bad for the Gunners, of course, as those injuries allowed academy products Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri to break into the first team. Lewis-Skelly has since gone on to make his debut for England and sign a new long-term deal. Nwaneri is close to doing the same - after scoring nine goals in 37 appearances. \"I don't think we can give excuses,\"  Gabriel, 27, told BBC Sport. \"We did everything we could in the last three years. I feel like we had a little bit of bad luck sometimes, but we all believe that we can win big titles.\"We're focused on what our manager is telling us to do, and what we have to do, and what we have to improve. I think this year will be different.\"Signing 'great players' like GyokeresImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gabriel and Arsenal faced Gyokeres in last season's Champions LeagueArsenal have been busy in the transfer market and will have several new faces in their squad when they start their Premier League season at Manchester United on Sunday, 17 August.The Gunners have already signed winger Noni Madueke, midfielders Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard, and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. They are also working to complete transfers for striker Viktor Gyokeres and young defender Cristhian Mosquera.Zubimendi is one of the most highly rated defensive midfielders in Europe. Premier League champions Liverpool tried to sign him last season, and he played a crucial role in the Euro 2024 final as a half-time substitute as Spain beat England. Alongside him, Arsenal have brought in midfielder Norgaard from Brentford to provide experience now Jorginho and Thomas Partey have departed.Madueke is seen as ideal back-up for Saka, but also someone who can play on both wings, challenge Martinelli for his position, and continue developing his own game.\"I think the players that came will help us out a lot,\" Gabriel said. \"The club is doing what is best for the players and the manager. They are definitely doing their best to bring the best players that can help us, but we have to focus on what we can do out on the pitch. \"The players that are here are doing that. We are strong and we are getting stronger with these new players.\"Definitely, it excites me. We want to have the best players. To be in the dispute for titles, you have to have the best players.\"Arsenal will hope the expected arrival of Gyokeres from Sporting will bring goals, with the Swede having scored 54 in 52 games last season.Gabriel has played against Gyokeres, and mimicked the forward's celebration after scoring in Arsenal's 5-0 win over Sporting in November in the Champions League.\"We all know he is a great player, but he is a Sporting player not an Arsenal player,\" Gabriel said.\"Playing against him last year was a challenge. He is great and had a great season. About the celebration, it is something I can't talk about right now.\"The desire to 'win big titles'Gabriel missed the final weeks of last season after injuring a hamstring in April. He had surgery to fix the problem and is working to be fit for the beginning of the season.The Brazilian has signed a contract that will keep him at the club until 2029 - and says he \"didn't hear\" about links with a move to Saudi Arabia.The feeling around Arsenal is they are ready to take the next step, and feel confident to say publicly they are ready to lift a trophy.\"I've been at the club for five years now and I've seen how much the club has grown.\" added Gabriel, who was speaking before the club's pre-season tour, where the Gunners will play AC Milan on 23 July and Newcastle on 27 July in the Singapore Festival of Football.\"I am here to win big titles and I do believe that this season will be different. We have let a couple of titles slip through our fingers recently.\"We almost won but I think this year, things will be different. I have a lot of faith in that.\"More on this story"

      "content": "We're clear of the All-Star break and the MLB Draft, and that means the next big date on the baseball calendar is the July 31 trade deadline. Speaking of which, each day leading up to the deadline brings us a fresh supply of deadline rumors, and you can find Sunday's just below. Yankees, Red Sox eyeing D-backsWill the Arizona Diamondbacks sell at the deadline? That's one of the biggest questions as we work our way toward July 31. If they do decide to cut bait on the thus-far disappointing 2025 season, then they have a number of alluring trade targets. Speaking of which, USA Today reports that the blood-rival New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox have designs on a D-back or three. Bob Nightengale writes: \"The Yankees and Red Sox, each looking for a starting pitcher, have sent scouts to watch Diamondbacks starters Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly in Phoenix, with the Yankees also keeping a close eye on third baseman Eugenio Suárez (32 homers, 80 RBI).\"Gallen has endured uncharacteristic struggles this season, but deadline buyers might see the strong track record and bet on a rebound. Kelly has enjoyed a standout 2025 thus far, and his appeal is obvious. Suárez as a third baseman fills a role for a number of contenders, and he's been one of the most potent power hitters in baseball this season. Braves likely to sell but deeper teardown may waitThe Atlanta Braves were expected to contend for the NL East title this season, but instead they're presently in fourth place and on pace for 90 losses. As such, they're poised to trade away select veterans over the next several days, but a full reset probably isn't in the offing, at least for now. Here's Nightengale again: \n        \n\n\"Atlanta is expected to listen to trade offers for catcher second baseman Ozzie Albies, center fielder Michael Harris and catcher Sean Murphy, but not until this winter.\"They are letting teams know that DH Marcell Ozuna, closer Raisel Iglesias and reliever Pierce Johnson are all available.\"Ozuna, who has 10-and-5 rights, can veto any trade.\"Ozuna, as noted, has power over the process, and he's also shown some signs of decline in this, his age-34 season. Johnson should have plenty of interest, and Iglesias has out-pitched his ERA, which means interested parties may be on the underlying results to hold sway. By the sounds of it, though, the coming winter will be what determines the shape of the Braves' future. Deep sell by Rangers unlikelySpeaking of disappointing teams, the Rangers haven't bounced back to their 2023 championship form as hoped, and that could mean a soft pivot of sorts at the deadline. The emphasis, however, is on soft, as ESPN's Buster Olney reports: \n        \n\n\"If the Rangers do decide to trade away talent, however, they could make some more measured moves. Jacob deGrom and Nathan Eovaldi are not considered to be in play, at least by some other teams; Adolis García, on the other hand, could be.\"Texas at this writing is just 2 ½ games out of the final AL wild-card spot, so it's prudent not to slough off valuable contributors like deGrom and Eovaldi. García, though, may not be off limits."

But the Dockers dug in, found a way, caught the right breaks and registered one of the most significant wins in coach Justin Longmuir’s tenure.Early in the final term, the Dockers appeared to have fired all their bullets. Collingwood had kicked two early goals and skipped out to a 22-point lead. Daicos was off the leash, the Magpies’ pressure was relentless, the umpiring was a shambles, and Matthew Johnson’s leg was dangling like a ventriloquist’s doll.Up until about a month ago, theDockers were under no circumstances to be trusted in these scenarios. They tossed away their 2024 season by getting the wobbles in close finishes. The Magpies, conversely, have been the masters of managing their moments, of buying precious seconds, and of sowing doubt and confusion in the opposition.But the Dockers kept their heads and rattled home. There were a number of moments that will be lodged in the memory for Fremantle supporters – Luke Jackson hurling himself at packs, Nathan O’Driscoll putting his body on the line repeatedly in the final 45 seconds, and Josh Treacy’s goal saving mark.They also had the unexpected luxury of Patrick Voss turning in the game of his life, on the biggest stage he’s played on. The Pies were down a couple of key defenders and Fremantle exploited it. Early on, Voss was far too sharp for Darcy Moore on the lead, and he didn’t allow the Collingwood captain to sag off and attack.Patrick Voss boots a career-high six goals in Fremantle’s win over Collingwood at the MCG. Photograph: Michael Willson/AFL Photos/Getty ImagesVoss plays a pretty simple game. He runs in straight lines, plays within his limitations and is an energy injector. He hasn’t always been the most reliable set shot but his six goals came from some very difficult spots. He’d never kicked more than three goals in a match prior to facing the Pies and by the time he’d reached that mark, Moore had been shifted off him. Voss is yet another footballing success story to come at Essendon’s expense.More than anything, it was Fremantle’s ability to absorb Collingwood’s manic pressure which proved decisive. The Pies play such a different brand to the wild cavalry charges of 2022 and 2023. When the Magpies swarm is in full effect, it gives the opposition no time to think and breathe. They brought extreme pressure to the MCG, especially in their forward half. Every time the Dockers endeavoured to exit by hand, there was a wave of Pies cascading down on them. Once they’d forced the turnover, they’d handball their way out of trouble. And when they’re in sync, and they’re flicking the ball through the middle of the field, they move it like a rugby team.But the Dockers were clever and patient in the way they worked their way through the press, with their triangular handball chains and their boundary-hugging kicks. They mostly resisted the urge to bomb down the throats of the Magpies’ interceptors.The last time Fremantle played Collingwood, they beat them in nearly every key stat but had no answers for Jamie Elliott and Bobby Hill. They played high energy but occasionally hare-brained football. The Magpies’ win that night was a victory of quality over quantity. This game was the opposite. The Dockers were smashed in the inside 50s count and Nick Daicos has never had more touches in an AFL game. But the visitors were much smarter with their ball use this time around.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionElsewhere, the individual performance of the round was undoubtedly Isaac Heeney, who racked up equal career-best stats for goals and clearances against North Melbourne. But the moment of the week was surely Maurice Rioli Jnr, who executed one of the best tackles I’ve ever seen on a footy field. Dermott Brereton once said the late Maurice Rioli Snr was the strongest tackler he saw, or felt, in league football. On Saturday night, Rioli Jnr pinned his ears back, sprinted and lunged like the T-1000 latching onto Arnie’s car in Terminator 2. Richmond were never losing from that moment on.In early March, nearly every professional and amateur pundit in the country had the Tigers as likely wooden spooners. But Adem Yze has coached the ears off this team. They had a dirty fortnight where Tom Lynch lost his mind against Adelaide and where Geelong toyed with them. But five wins, ahead of North Melbourne, equal with St Kilda and just one behind Melbourne, exceeds the most cock-eyed expectations. Scorched earth rebuilding teams often fall in a heap by the middle of the winter but to see Rioli Jnr in mid-air spoke of a team that is still engaged, that is very much playing for its coach, and capable of taking a few scalps in the run home.</p>"

Join us for the latest transfer news, rumors and gossip from around the globe.Transfers homepage | Done deals | Men's grades | Women's gradesTOP STORIES- Source: USMNT's Sargent close to Wolfsburg move\n- Sources: Rashford close to Barcelona loan move\n- Howe: Isak missed Newcastle game due to transfer speculationTRENDING RUMORS- Liverpool are not going to give up attempting to renew Ibrahima Konaté's contract, with L'Équipe reporting that they are concerned about interest from Real Madrid. Liverpool lost Trent Alexander-Arnold to the LaLiga giants this summer, receiving only a small fee because Real Madrid wanted to bring his registration forward for the start of the Club World Cup. The 26-year-old Konate has also moved into the final 12 months of his deal, meaning he can sign a pre-contract agreement with a club outside of England starting Jan. 1. However, while Liverpool have not yet been prepared to match the central defender's demands, the Premier League champions are determined he won't go the same route as Alexander-Arnold.- Juventus have reached an agreement to sign Jadon Sancho from Manchester United, and the deal could be confirmed by Thursday. Tuttosport reports that the winger will sign a four-year contract worth €6 million plus bonuses. Juve have made an offer of £15 million, and they hope they can get the deal over the line by including a series of achievable add-ons to bump up the fee. As for exits, Fabrice Hawkins reports that United States star Timothy Weah has agreed to terms to complete a move to Marseille.- Liverpool have reached an \"outline agreement\" with Eintracht Frankfurt over the proposed transfer of Hugo Ekitike, The Athletic reports. The next 24 hours are expected to be crucial, as there's still work to be done before the deal is formally wrapped up. ESPN sources revealed on Thursday that Liverpool were in advanced talks to sign the 23-year-old, who has already agreed to personal terms. The Premier League champions have already recruited fellow Bundesliga star Florian Wirtz this summer. Should all add-ons be met, the final transfer fee is expected to exceed the €95 million Eintracht received from Paris Saint-Germain for Randal Kolo Muani in 2023.- Adam Wharton is set to stay at Crystal Palace for the 2025-26 season, making Liverpool favorites to sign him in the summer of 2026. The Sun on Sunday reports that Palace do not want to lose the midfielder, as Marc Guéhi and Eberechi Eze are likely to depart before the transfer deadline on Sept. 1. Tottenham Hotspur, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are also looking at the 21-year-old. If he stays at Selhurst Park, Liverpool will be in a stronger position to make a move after prioritizing attacking changes ahead of the upcoming campaign.- Vinícius Júnior's contract renewal at Real Madrid is \"up in the air,\" according to the Diario AS front-page story on Sunday. The newspaper claims talks over a new deal have stalled since February, when the Brazil forward's camp told Madrid what he'd expect to earn. Vinícius' current contract expires in 2027, and the club would be reluctant to allow negotiations to drag on into next year, although interest from Saudi Arabia in the player appears to have diminished. The report adds that he wants a salary increase from €15m per year to €20m, making him the club's best-paid player.EXPERT TAKEplay2:07Ogden: Isak missing Newcastle's friendly raises suspicions of a moveMark Ogden debates why Alexander Isak was sent home ahead of Newcastle's friendly vs. Celtic.CONFIRMED DEALS- Kyle Walker-Peters has signed a three-year contract with West Ham United after leaving Southampton.

(2:05)Andreas HaleJul 20, 2025, 02:58 AM ETCloseAndreas Hale is a combat sports reporter at ESPN. Andreas covers MMA, boxing and pro wrestling. In Andreas' free time, he plays video games, obsesses over music and is a White Sox and 49ers fan. He is also a host for Sirius XM's Fight Nation. Before joining ESPN, Andreas was a senior writer at DAZN and Sporting News. He started his career as a music journalist for outlets including HipHopDX, The Grammys and Jay-Z's Life+Times. He is also an NAACP Image Award-nominated filmmaker as a producer for the animated short film \"Bridges\" in 2024.LAS VEGAS -- Manny Pacquiao, 46, looked a lot better in his fight with Mario Barrios on Saturday than he did four years ago when he lost to Yordenis Ugas. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough for Pacquiao to break his record as the oldest fighter to win a welterweight world title, as the fight ended in a disappointing majority draw.Regardless of the outcome, Pacquiao defied the odds by being competitive with a champion 16 years younger than him and by showing some of the explosiveness and speed that made him an eight-division world champion and one of the biggest stars in the sport. Of bigger significance is that Pacquiao stated this wouldn't be his last fight.\"Don't worry, the PacMan is back, and the journey will continue,\" Pacquiao said at the postfight news conference.And if he does fight again, who should he face next? Both Barrios and Pacquiao agreed after the fight that there should be a rematch soon, but is that what the fans really want?Seeing Hall of Famer Pacquiao back in action might have been exciting, but once the novelty wore off, it wasn't quite the type of barnburner that would warrant a return bout outside of the idea of Pacquiao getting another attempt at making history.Instead, it was two fighters landing at a low clip, with Pacquiao landing 101 of 577 total punches (17.5%) and Barrios narrowly outlanding his older opponent 120-658 (18.2%).For this version of Pacquiao, it was a great performance after four years away from the sport. However, the Pacquiao of a decade ago likely would have had little problem dispatching Barrios.The reality is that Barrios presented the clearest path to Pacquiao winning a world championship, and Pacquiao was unable to pull it off. Although, some observers did feel he won the fight. (ESPN had Pacquiao winning 115-113.) However, there are bigger and better fights for the Filipino sensation besides Barrios.\"I don't mean this in a mean way, but f--- Mario Barrios,\" Pacquiao's manager Sean Gibbons told reporters after the fight. \"He's a nice guy and I like the kid, but Manny deserves a bigger name. There are fighters like Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis and [Rolando] \"Rolly\" Romero out there.\"The Davis fight seems like a long shot due to Tank being in a lower weight class (135 pounds), although it would be a massive fight and quite a dangerous one for Pacquiao. But a fight with Romero certainly feels both winnable and realistic for Pacquiao.Romero is the WBA \"regular\" welterweight champion and is coming off a stunning decision win over Ryan Garcia in May. Romero doesn't have a clear next opponent, and he will be elevated to full champion once Jaron \"Boots\" Ennis formally vacates his title and moves up to 154 pounds. It's a less dangerous option than the winner of November's fight between WBO champion Brian Norman Jr. and former undisputed lightweight champion Devin Haney; both are young, strong and would present significant problems for an older Pacquiao.Pacquiao is interested in fighting again at the end of the year, so a fight with Romero lines up perfectly.Ultimately, the decision will be Pacquiao's to make.Romero has heavy hands but lacks footwork and defense. He is riding a wave of visibility and would almost certainly sell the fight in ways that Barrios couldn't. The fight itself would be action-packed, with Romero trying to hit a home run on a legend and Pacquiao darting in and out with combinations.It's either that or pull Floyd Mayweather out of retirement for a rematch.Don't laugh, because Pacquiao is dead serious.\"If [Mayweather] comes out of retirement and signs the contract, we'll fight,\" Pacquiao said. \"Let's fight again if he wants. I'm active now.\"Boxing fans might not want that rematch, but it's a viable option in a world where Jake Paul fought Mike Tyson and pulled off massive viewership numbers.But until Mayweather formally announces that he's back, let's stick with what's realistic for Pacquiao: Rolando \"Rolly\" Romero."

She struggled again during Thursday’s quarter-final victory against Sweden and has now revealed the unacceptable vitriol she has been a victim of while on international duty.“From the start of the tournament I have experienced a lot of racial abuse,” the 27-year-old defender wrote on Instagram. “While I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I don’t agree or think it’s OK to target someone’s appearance or race. As a result of this I will be taking a step back from social media and leaving it to a team to deal with.”Carter has received widespread support, most emphatically from her teammates. In a collective statement, the Lionesses said: “Representing our country is the greatest honour. It is not right that while we are doing that, some of us are treated differently simply because of the colour of our skin. Until now, we have chosen to take the knee before matches. It is clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism. We have agreed as a squad to remain standing before kick-off on Tuesday.”Lotte Wubben-Moy went further by announcing she was also coming off social media. In a statement, the Arsenal defender said: “Another tournament goes by where we see the same disgusting racist abuse. It is unacceptable for any person to be subject to this or any kind of abuse. The issue goes beyond sport. But what is being done about it? On the very platforms we post on? I will not continue to feed the very platform that enables abuse with no consequence.”Speaking about the Lionesses’ decision to stop taking the knee, Lucy Bronze said: “It was driven by the group - obviously certain individuals more than others. I think it was just the fact that we feel as a collective, is the message as strong as it used to be? Is the message really hitting hard? Because to us it feels like it’s not if these things are still happening to our players in the biggest tournaments of their lives.“It’s about putting another statement out there to say, you know, it’s something that still is a problem, it’s something that still needs to be put right. More needs to be done in football, more needs to be done in society, what that is right now as an individual, I don’t exactly know. But it’s something that we collectively as a team and as a federation want to work towards, we want to make changes. This is a small step trying to create another change.”Jess Carter (front row, second right) lines up with her England teammates before their Euro 2025 quarter-final against Sweden. Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesThe Football Association is working with authorities to track down those responsible for targeting Carter. The chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said: “As soon as we were made aware of the racist abuse Jess received, we immediately contacted UK police. They are in touch with the relevant social media platform, and we are working with police to ensure those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice.“Regrettably, this is not the first time this has happened to an England player, so we had measures in place to allow us to respond quickly and where possible provide information to support any potential police action. We will continue to discuss with the relevant authorities and social media companies about what more can and should be done to prevent this abhorrent abuse.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionKick It Out has also come out in support of Carter, backing her decision “to look after her own well-being”, with the Prime Minister also standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the player. “There is no place for racism in football or anywhere in society,” said Keir Starmer in a statement. “I stand with Jess, the Lionesses, and any players who have suffered racism, on and off the pitch.”Uefa also condemned the abuse of Carter, saying “abuse and discrimination should never be tolerated, whether in football or society, in person or online” – a stance that the player’s club, Gotham FC, shares. “We are heartbroken and outraged by the racist abuse directed at Jess Carter,” Gotham said in a statement.“Jess is not only a world-class football player – she is a role model, a leader and a valued part of our family. At Gotham, we believe in a culture of mutual respect and remain committed to building a game – and a community – where everyone feels safe, respected and celebrated. There is no place for racism in our sport.”Carter, who was excellent in England’s 4-0 group stage victory over Netherlands, went on to thank “genuine” England fans for their support, making clear her “focus is on helping the team anyway I can” before their semi-final against Italy on Tuesday. “Hopefully, speaking out will make the people writing this abuse think twice so that others won’t have to deal with it,” she said. “We have made some historic changes with this Lionesses squad that I am so proud to be a part of and my hope is that by speaking out about this it will make another positive change for all.”</p>"

All cohesion has gone from the chasers, they’re just attacking each other.19km to go. Wellens is gone and away, he leads by 1min 25secs. The battle is now for second place24km to go. There is some interest in the peloton in hunting down the chase group. Carlos Rodriguez, the Ineos rider, could move up the GC standings at the expense of EF Education’s Ben Healy.30km to go. Wellens has truly broken today’s stage, he has 57 seconds on the chasers now and surely a stage win in his grasp. What an attack. He sat in the lead group and did minimal work before pouncing at the key moment, just before the start of the descent.36km to go. Wellens now has a lead of 29 seconds. The descent makes up most of the run into the line, there will be only 7km to the end of the stage once Wellens gets off the bottom of the hill.39km to go. Wellens has a 18 second lead now. Barguil, Storer, Campenaerts, Vlasov and Simmons are barreling downhill to catch up.43km to go. Tim Wellens has gone for a long range attack. He waited for the group of Barguil to catch up and then went off. Quinn Simmons is chasing but the Belgian rider has got a gap and is now on the descent.46km to go. Rodriguez, Barguil, Vlasov and Lutsenko are the second group on the road and 20 seconds behind the leaders. Their hopes of winning the stage are not completely over, yet.Tony Hughes has emailed in with an interesting take:If Jonas wins nothing ever again, or retires or whatnot, I hope even with his stolid demeanor, he can at some point look back and take comfort in the fact that he held off what may be the greatest cyclist of all time for two consecutive years (acknowledging Tadej’s crash/injury in 2023 contributed to this). Neutrals may wish for a Fignon-LeMond-esque finish each year but the battle between Tadej and Jonas during the 2020s has to me, in every way, been as fascinating. Chess on wheels.50km to go. The leaders are through the steepest section of the climb and the gradients are now much severe. There is not a lot of harmony amongst them though and if they are reeled in it will be because they haven’t worked together. The keep on attacking each other and that is not the way to grow the time gap.52km to go. The second group on the road are now more than 35 seconds behind the leaders.53km to go. Storer wants to attack that group of leaders again. He probably needs to break Simmons, Campeanaerts and Wellens on this climb to win.55km to go. With Barguil and Vlasov riding over the leading group has grown again, but not for long. Simmons and Storer have gone away off the front on the category two climb. Will this stick? There are two more riders behind Simmons and Storer, Campeanaerts and Wellens.56km to go. The nine riders at the front are being closed down by the larger group behind. Barguil and Vlasov are now 12 seconds behind.61km to go. Leknessund is now across and the second group on the road is now only 20 seconds or so back. That is just a couple of riders, Warren Barguil and Aleksandr Vlasov.62km to go. Leknessund has made ground on the leading group of eight. He is now about 15 seconds behind.74km to go. The leaders are heading down the Côte de Sorèze and are coming up to the next climb in 15km or so. Andreas Leknessund is 30 seconds behind that group of eight and behind him are 25 riders, then a fair bit further behind (2mins 47secs) is the peloton, which features the yellow jersey. I think it’s now safe to say that winner will come from those 34 riders who have escaped the peloton and most likely the eight up the very front.83km to go. Rodriguez has made it, so that lead group is now eight men.84km to go. Ineos rider Carlos Rodriguez is trying to chase down the seven men at the front the race. He has about seconds to make up and that would be a big boost for his team, who missed the original break.87km to go. The lead group has been whittled down to seven riders as they hit the second category Côte de Sorèze climb. Campenaerts, Lutsenko, Simmons, Wellens, Powless, Storer and Mohoric are now 47 seconds ahead of the remaining number from the original breakaway and a number of others from the main peloton.92km to go. This is shifting again. Four riders have gone off after the breakaway but are still some 30 seconds behind.97km to go. Milan seems to have a problem again. He has fallen about a minute behind the peloton and even further back is a 38-rider group featuring the current polka dot jersey leader, Lenny Martinez.Robin Lynch has emailed in as he still has a few things on his wishlist for the final week:Looking forward to the final stage in Paris with the Montmartre climb and hoping that Wout can win that one. Would love to see Vingegaard take one of the mountain stages and a bit of spice for the last podium place between Vauquelin, Onley, Lipowitz on stage 19. Feels too greedy to hope for a late hurrah from Alaphilippe, but praying to the cycling gods nonetheless.103km to go. The frantic racing has calmed a little now. The breakaway has a lead of around 50 seconds and rising, Ineos appear to have given up the chase for the time being. Van Der Poel will fancy his chances if this breakaway is allowed to stay out in front.108km to go. Van Der Poel has taken the 20 points on offer at the intermediate sprint to close in on Pogacar in second place in the green jersey standings.Mathieu van der Poel of Alpecin-Deceuninck attacks during stage 15. Photograph: Shutterstock110km to go. The intermediate sprint is coming up in a kilometre. The peloton is now back together and 30 seconds behind the lead group.More thoughts on Pogacar’s game plan from John Westwell via email:I wasn’t surprised that Pogacar didn’t seem bothered about winning yesterday’s stage, and I’d be even more surprised if he doesn’t just want to sit back and have a ‘steady’ day today. He knows he’s in control of the race now.He will almost certainly be looking to win on Mont Ventoux on Tuesday, though. Not least because Eddy Merckxx won on the summit in 1970 and Pogacar seems keen to measure himself against Merckxx at every opportunity.Andrew Benton has emailed in from Hong Kong with what he’s looking out for in the final week:I’ll be looking for Geraint Thomas to bag a stage win. I’d imagine he’s not planning to, but perhaps an opportunity could present itself, and that would be super. And one for Julian Alaphilippe, too, why not.In the ‘90s it was Indurain, in the 2000s Armstrong (its not about the bike, he wrote - and clearly it was not) and now, in the mid and late 20s, will we be seeing year after year of Pogacar victories? I don’t think so - he’ll dominate for a few years, but there are always others coming after him and they can be victorious, opportunity and chance can play a big role. But I don’t have a favourite, as long as the suspense continues until the last couple of stages each year.118km to go. Ineos do not have a rider in the lead group and are working hard on the front of the peloton to bring that back. The gap is holding around 40 seconds.120km to go. Just as I write that Milan and Pogacar are in the same group, a split appears in the peloton. Milan is on the wrong side of it and the green jersey is now in the third group on the road, around 20 seconds behind the peloton.125km to go. The intermediate sprint is rapidly approaching, coming up in about 15km. The current green jersey leader is Jonathan Milan, who is 28 points ahead of the Pogacar. Both of them are in the main peloton but Van Der Poel is in the breakaway and could make up some serious ground in that particualr race today.127km to go. Girmay has given up his pursuit of the breakaway, which now has a lead of 40 seconds over the peloton.131km to go. The peloton is now back together, with Pogacar, Vingegaard and Florian Lipowitz all together.134km to go. There are plenty of attacks happening. Biniam Girmay is the latest to go off from Pogacar’s group in pursuit of the 15-rider breakaway and have made up about 12 seconds.137km to go. A large-ish group featuring Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease a Bike), Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), Matej Mohoric (Bahrain Victorious), Clément Russo (Groupama-FDJ), Kaden Groves, Mathieu Van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Matteo Vercher (Total Energies), Alexey Lutsenko (Israel Premier Tech) and Jarrad Drizners (Lotto) are hovering around 30 seconds ahead of Pogacar’s group. The chasers off the back, a group which features Vingegaard, are catching the main bunch. The gap now is around 26 seconds, but the pace is very high.143km to go. The peloton is about one minute behind Pogacar’s group. A slightly chaotic start to stage 15 which has limited any breakaway threats.146km to go. The peloton is back together at the front, but there are some gaps further back. UAE Team radio has just been played on the broadcast requesting that Pogacar slow the front of the race as a Vingegaard was caught in the crash incident. It’s not clear whether or not the Dane was involved in the crash itself.148km to go. We’ve had a couple of crashes in the early running, Julian Alaphilippe had to go the medical car but has resumed. Jordi Meeus and Gianni Moscon are pacing Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) back to the bunch.150km to go. Neilson Powless of EF Education-EasyPost has gone off the front on his own but he was chased by Tobias Foss, Alexey Lutsenko and Yevgeniy Fedorov. This doesn’t look like it’s going to stick as they have less than 15 seconds on the peloton.We are underwayBit of confusion on my part, caused by ITV’s race coverage starting a little later and the baffling CET. Anyway, we’re now off racing.Lotto have announced that Lennert Van Eetvelt will not start stage 15 and is withdrawing from the Tour de France. Van Eetvelt crashed at the Belgian national championships and was involved in an incident during the second stage of the Tour. According to his team, ‘the physical toll’ has proven too much for him to continue and he will now begin recovery.As ever, you can get in touch via email. The link is at the top of this page. With the yellow jersey seemingly decided, I’d be interested to hear what you’ll be looking out for during the final week of the Tour.The peloton will soon be rolling out of Muret and then it’ll be another 10 minutes to KM0 where the racing will get underway.A quick reminder of the various standingsGeneral classification1.

Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling Team) 14PreambleIt was nice of Tadej Pogacar to finally let some of the other riders to have a go yesterday and he still found a way to twist the knife further into the heart of Jonas Vingegaard’s beleaguered hopes of winning the Tour de France. Even the Dane’s most generous fans would struggle to describe him as a yellow jersey rival now. Pogacar’s advantage is 4mins 13secs and he is essentially racing against himself. The Slovenian has 21 stage wins and there is every chance that he will continue his rapid pursuit of Mark Cavendish’s record. Pogacar made it pretty clear after winning stage 13 on Friday that he is not planning to take any days off.“I’m not here to make enemies,” he said, “but it’s the Tour, you cannot just back off if there’s the opportunity for a stage win. You never know when it’s your last day on the Tour.“I will say it honestly. The team pays you to win, and there’s a big team behind me that supports me and that works every single day of their career to come to the Tour, to win the Tour. If there is an opportunity, you go for it. You can’t say no to a stage in the Tour.”Still, UAE Emirates may look at the empty threat to Pogacar’s general classification lead and decide to play this one safe. There are three categorised climbs and a lumpy to descent into Carcassonne to contend with, so maybe there is a bit of hope for the breakaway? Should that be allowed to play out, such is the nature of professional cycling in this constant-go era that a winner for this stage will likely be a familiar name capable on the slopes from the one-day racing pack. Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Wout van Aert (Visma-LAB) are strong contenders, maybe even Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-LAB) or someone with that kind of profile.For the good of the Tour, a non-Pogacar stage win would be good. Domination can quickly become dull and while there is nothing boring about Pogacar’s style of racing, cycling as a foregone conclusion is not much of a sport."

The result: Cook rushed for 1,009 yards and 16 touchdowns while adding 32 receptions for 258 yards and two more scores as a receiver. He finished as RB8 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and his maturation into a scoring threat cemented his status as a Fantasy football superstar.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.\n        \n\nThe model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking. The 2025 Fantasy football PPR rankings and 2025 Fantasy football standard rankings update multiple times daily, so you're always getting the best Fantasy football advice.Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepersOne of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Cowboys running back Javonte Williams. Dallas has been rumored to be in the running back market all offseason after letting 1,000-yard backs Tony Pollard and Rico Dowdle walk in successive years. However, they were relatively quiet on that front, spending fifth and seventh-round draft picks on Jaydon Blue and Phil Mafah while spending minimally to add Williams and fellow veteran Miles Sanders.\n        \n\nThose four backs and Deuce Vaughn will now compete for reps, and Williams might have the edge on everybody because of his versatility. He's had at least 40 receptions in all three of the seasons where he was healthy since being drafted in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft and he was given at least 191 touches in each of those years. The Cowboys will ride the hot hand from this unit, but the model favors Williams as the early starter and ranks him ahead of Najee Harris and Zach Charbonnet, who are going at least one round earlier on average.Another sleeper that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy. The 25-year-old may never be able to shake off the Mr. Irrelevant title as the final selection in the 2022 NFL Draft, and similar to 2022, Purdy continues to go later than he should in Fantasy football drafts. Purdy was fourth in the NFL MVP voting in 2023 and last year, he threw for the fifth-most yards per game (257.6) of quarterbacks who played multiple games. Purdy was QB11 on a points-per-game basis among starters quarterbacks last year despite battling injuries and San Francisco playmakers missing multiple weeks as well.The model projects Purdy as a top 10 Fantasy football quarterback, despite him being selected outside the top 12 at his position in early ADP for the 2025 Fantasy football season. Christian McCaffrey should be healthy, and despite losing Deebo Samuel, the 49ers still have a strong skill position group, including receivers Brandon Aiyuk, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall. The 49ers ranked 14th in scoring last year after being the No. 2 scoring offense in 2023, and the model projects a closer to the 2023 season from Purdy and his playmakers. See which other Fantasy football sleepers 2025 to pick here.\n        \n\nHow to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankingsSportsLine is also extremely high on a veteran wide receiver to surprise with his production. The model says this wideout is a shocking top-10 option ahead of younger stars like A.J. Brown and Drake London. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine.So which 2025 Fantasy Football sleepers should you target? And which wide receiver shocks the NFL with a top-10 performance? Visit SportsLine now to get 2025 Fantasy Football cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that called James Cook's huge season, and find out."

      "category": "general",
      "content": "Is it defensible to refer to the defending National League Central champs as \"upstarts?\" It is, and such is the state of the expectations -- and the baseball -- in Milwaukee these days. The Brewers on Saturday night in L.A. ticked off their ninth straight win with an 8-7 triumph over the Dodgers, and five of those nine straight wins have come at the expense of the defending World Series champions.This, though, is not some outlier heater the Brewers are on. This is quite simply one of the best teams in Major League Baseball this season. The Saturday night win in Dodger Stadium pushed Pat Murphy's squad to 58-40 on the season. That puts them on pace for 96 wins, which would tie the franchise record for most wins in a season (2011 and 2018). More to the present point, they remain only one game behind the juggernaut Chicago Cubs in the National League Central, which has, contrary to expectations, looked like the strongest division in baseball so far. At the same time, the Brewers are in the top wild-card spot in the NL, and they have a playoff-position cushion of five games. That's substantial here in the second half, and as such SportsLine gives them a 94.7% chance of making the postseason. The Brewers have backed it all up with a plus-84 run differential; across all of Major League Baseball just the Cubs and New York Yankees have a stronger run differentials. So, yes, the Brewers seem once again bound for playoff baseball. If trends hold, this will be their seventh trip to the postseason in the last eight years. A deep run has eluded them since 2018, when they made it as far as the NLCS, but they keep getting their cracks at it despite bottom-10 payrolls and substantial roster turnover. In recent years, they've kept it up despite trading away ace Corbin Burnes, losing lead decision-maker David Stearns to the Mets and manager Craig Counsell to the Cubs, and just this past winter seeing shortstop Willy Adames sign a lucrative free-agent contract with the Giants. Still and yet -- and with increasingly limited contributions from owner Mark Attanasio -- the Brewers just win. This season, it's been a balanced path to success. Consider: The Brewers rank seventh in MLB in runs scored. They rank third in MLB in rotation ERA. They rank 10th in MLB in Defensive Efficiency Rating, or the percentage of balls in play that the defense converts into outs. They lead the majors in base-running runs above average, according to FanGraphs.As you may have gleaned from above, the rotation is doing the heavy lifting for Milwaukee, and it figures to continue. Starting pitching was the Brewers' strength even before rookie phenom (and All-Star) Jacob Misiorowski made his debut on June 6 and even before stalwart frontline presence Brandon Woodruff made his return just two starts ago. Long an organization known for pitching development, the Brewers right now appear to have more good starting pitchers than they can use, and that'll especially be the case once Nestor Cortes returns from his elbow injury. Rotation depth, though, is there until it isn't, and that's truer than ever in the contemporary era of pitcher attrition. \n        \n\nThe Brewers may opt to keep all that in place leading up to the trade deadline, which could give them some flexibility to fill bullpen roles on the side should the stretch-drive demand such. Yes, they'll no doubt get plenty of calls on Freddy Peralta and others, but it's hard to imagine that a team in the mix for best record in baseball would rob Peter to pay Paul in such a way. \nAt an individual level, there just aren't many soft underbellies to be found on the Milwaukee roster. Shortstop has been a weak spot thanks to Joey Ortiz's struggles, but that's really about it. There are \"stars and scrubs\" rosters to be found across MLB, and then there's Milwaukee's \"neither stars nor scrubs\" construction in which the whole feels greater than the constituent elements. In a way, it's fitting formula for a team that's doggedly consistent in its outcomes but still somehow overlooked. Looking forward, the Brewers of course have designs not only on the NL Central title but also on a first-round bye. The schedule ahead is one of MLB's toughest, as the Brewers' remaining opponents have a winning percentage of .513. That ranks fourth. The Cubs, meantime, have a remaining figure of .481, which ranks 29th. From the Milwaukee standpoint, there is unwelcome rigor there, yes, but there's also opportunity. Lifting up Milwaukee's strength of schedule are eight remaining head-to-head games against those Cubs. It's no great stretch to say the outcome of those games could determine the division title and one of the two byes available to NL clubs. \n        \n\nIt's looking like a heavyweight fight down the stretch in the NL Central, and no less a heavyweight than the Dodgers would surely attest that the Brewers can win that fight. Maybe that's contrary to expectations coming into the season, but it probably shouldn't have been."

Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is flanked by two of the fastest wideouts in the game with Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, and next to him in the backfield is one of the quickest running backs in the league in De'Von Achane. However, there's another speedster you should be aware of in 2025.The Dolphins selected running back Jaylen Wright out of the University of Tennessee in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft, and while he rushed for just 249 yards on 68 carries as a rookie, he's expected to take on a much larger role in the offense in Year 2. During a recent appearance on \"Up & Adams,\" Wright said that he has the potential to be one of the best running backs in the league due to his unique skillset. \"I just really feel like and I know I can be a top back in this league,\" Wright said, via NFL.com. \"I feel like just my skillset, my ability and the system I'm in, it sets me up to be great. … It's a long season, staying the course, doing what I got to do every time I touch that rock, every time the ball comes to me just make a play. I'm very excited. I'm very blessed to be in this position. It's going to be a very great year this year.\"\n        \n\nWright also said that he's going to be \"way more involved\" in the passing game after catching just three passes for 8 yards in 2024. He can be a home-run hitter. Just look at what Wright did to the No. 1 Georgia Bulldogs on the first play from scrimmage back in 2023.\nIn his final collegiate season, Wright rushed for 1,013 yards and four touchdowns on 137 carries. He was the Volunteers' first 1,000-yard rusher since 2015, and the 7.4 yards per carry he averaged ranked second in the FBS. He raised some eyebrows by running a 4.38 40-yard dash at the NFL combine, which caught the eye of general manager Chris Grier and coach Mike McDaniel.\n        \n\nWhile there were questions about how he was used in 2024, Wright and Achane have the potential to be a dynamic one-two punch that keeps defenses winded all game long, and hopefully a duo that can put the Dolphins in position to snap the NFL's longest active playoff win drought."

The Lions placed Onwuzurike on the reserve/PUP list late last week, which ruled him out for the first four games of the season, but Campbell made it official on Sunday that his season is over before it started. \"Levi's out for the year,\" Campbell said to open his press conference. \"Levi's surgery, it was significant, but it needed to be done. Out of his control, and it needed to be done. So he will miss the season.\"Onwuzurike played 16 games for the Lions in 2024, starting 10, and was responsible for 28 tackles, 1.5 sacks, 1 forced fumble and 13 hits on the quarterback. With Alim McNeill on the PUP list to start training camp as he recovers from a torn ACL of his own he suffered in Week 15 of last season, the Lions come into training camp shorthanded on the defensive front. \n        \n\nMekhi Wingo is also beginning camp on the PUP list as he works his way back from a torn meniscus late last season, and they'll need to find and develop some more depth along the line in training camp. Rookie Tyleik Williams figures to take on a significant role quickly for Detroit after being selected in the first round out of Ohio State. There's hope McNeill and Wingo return at some point near the start of the regular season -- they're not on the reserve/PUP list which means they can be activated any time -- but for a team whose defense was decimated by injuries last season, the Lions were certainly hoping to start the 2025 campaign with better health than they are. \n        \n\nAfter spending four years as the linebackers coach in Detroit, Kelvin Sheppard enters his first season as the Lions defensive coordinator after the departure of Aaron Glenn. His promotion figures to make it a smooth transition on the defensive side of the ball, but one of his first challenges this season will be managing a defensive line that is already short on bodies before camp even begins."

A move to the Serie A club is, though, understood to be in progress with a number of formalities still to be completed.In Italy, there have been reports a deal has been agreed for an initial loan with a €40m (£34.5m) option to buy the player. Ferguson spent half last season on loan at West Ham for a disappointing spell in which he started just one match and was unable to score."

      "content": "The 2025 Open Championship concludes Sunday as throngs of fans in Northern Ireland eye two men in particular: Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy -- not particularly in that order. Respectively the 54-hole leader and fan favorite at Royal Portrush, the two men will battle across the tournament's final two pairings with a Claret Jug and the title Champion Golfer of the Year set to be awarded after the final 18 holes of pristine, difficult, unpredictable golf at one of the United Kingdom's most notable courses.While the weather had been a beast to start the week, conditions lightened up significantly as the weekend began with plenty of low scores for the taking. Scheffler followed the lowest round of his major championship career (64 on Saturday) with a 67 to sit 14 under and four clear of Sunday playing partner HaoTong Li. His margin over McIlroy is six, and it will take an incredible effort from the Ulsterman to make up enough ground where he can compete for the second Claret Jug of his career.Royal Portrush is hosting for just the third time in the history of the world's oldest golf championship with the Claret Jug set to be awarded outside Scotland or England in a rare circumstance. The course will continue to pressing the field, and as McIlroy can attest, truly anything is possible in Sunday's final round.As a 16-year-old amateur, McIlroy set the course record in Portrush with a 61; and yet, the last time The Open was held on the shores of Northern Ireland in 2019, he ejected with a 79 in the first round. Just 24 hours after that, he shot a 65, a 14-shot swing one from one day to the next. In other words, if a career grand slam winner and native son -- plus a modern champion -- can be tested by Royal Portrush, no one in the field this week is safe.The action wraps Sunday with the final round concluding major championship season, setting a path for the FedEx Cup Playoffs and 2025 Ryder Cup. The grounds are filled to capacity with fans, and they are undoubtedly keen to see how the likes of Scheffler, McIlroy, Shane Lowry, Robert MacIntyre, Matt Fitzpatrick, Jon Rahm and others fare across the final round of The Open.\n        \n\nThere is so much to follow that it can be overwhelming at times.

      "content": "The 2025 Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 400 from Dover Motor Speedway has a wide-open field considering the recent history at the 1-mile oval track. The last five races have been won by five different drivers, so you may be able to find a 2025 NASCAR at Dover longshot anywhere within the Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 400 odds board. While Ross Chastain isn't one of those victors, he is among a handful of drivers with multiple top 5s over this span, with his runner-up and third-place finishes both coming since he linked up with Trackhouse Racing. Even with that, Chastain is a +1400 NASCAR sleeper for Sunday's race, which begins at 2 p.m. ET. He is being undervalued by sportsbooks, but SportsLine's model, which has nailed eight winners just this year alone, likes Chastain at his long NASCAR Dover odds. Chastain has nine top-10 finishes this season and is -150 to crack the top 10 this week. Before entering any 2025 Dover NASCAR picks, be sure to see the latest 2025 NASCAR at Dover predictions from SportsLine's proven projection model. Developed by SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure, the proprietary NASCAR prediction model simulates every race 10,000 times and has nailed a whopping 26 winners since 2021, including eight winners in 2025.SportsLine simulated the NASCAR Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 400 10,000 times. Here are the three NASCAR longshots to target, according to the model:Best NASCAR at Dover longshots (odds subject to change):Ross Chastain (+1400)Tyler Reddick (+1400)Joey Logano (+2600)Ross Chastain (+1400)Ever since Trackhouse acquired Chip Ganassi Racing in 2022, Chastain has been a different driver at Dover. He never finished better than 15th across seven Dover starts while with Ganassi, but has since placed second, third and 12th in three starts with Trackhouse. Chastain led for 86 laps in the 2022 race at Dover Motor Speedway before placing third and then led for 98 laps -- and winning Stage 2 -- at the 2023 race before finishing second. Coincidentally, he also had second and third-place finishes in his last two Dover starts (2020) on the Xfinity Series. Chastain has finished among the top dozen drivers in five of his last six starts on 1-mile tracks, as a whole, as he's quite comfortable on intermediate circuits. You can also use DraftKings promo code on Chastain, which would allow you to get $150 in bonus bets after a $5 initial wager. Claim that promo right here.Tyler Reddick (+1400)After finishing sixth (2023) and fourth (2024) in NASCAR standings over the last two years, Reddick is again in contention for his first Cup Series championship. He's currently fourth in points thanks to a recent surge over different track types. Three weeks ago, he won a stage and finished fourth overall on the quad-oval of Atlanta and followed that up with a third place -- and posting the fastest lap -- on the streets of Chicago. Then last week, Reddick notched a sixth-place finish at Sonoma's road race, showing his versatility on various circuits. He has three top-six finishes over his last four starts on 1-mile tracks overall and is poised to outperform his NASCAR Dover odds.Joey Logano (+2600)Logano established his name on the Xfinity Series due to his success at Dover, sweeping both races at the track in both 2012 and 2013. His four Dover victories on that series are the second-most in NASCAR history, and while he's yet to claim a checkered flag at the track on the Cup Series, he's been in the running many times over. His 15 top 10s at Dover Motor Speedway are the third-most amongst active drivers, and over his last nine starts at Dover, he's placed in the top 10 more often than not. Add in that he has a pair of victories at a comparable track in Phoenix within the last three years, and Logano is a steal as a +2600 NASCAR sleeper which can be wagered on with a FanDuel promo code, which you can apply right here.More top NASCAR at Dover expert picks, longshots revealedYou've seen the NASCAR longshots from the model.

Dan also contributes to Get Up, NFL Live, SportsCenter, ESPN Radio, Sunday NFL Countdown and Fantasy Football Now. He is a New Jersey native who joined ESPN in 2011, and he is also the author of two published novels.Oh, we're getting there people. Pads will soon be popping. And the 53-man roster projections will soon be projecting. Some teams have already had players report for training camp, and every team will have by this time next week. Before long, we'll start learning which of our NFL offseason takes were overreactions and which ones weren't.But why wait?It's time for the training camp edition of the overreactions column, where I take a few conclusions you might have drawn from teams' offseason activity and tell you whether they're overreactions.More overreactions from Graziano:\nFree agency | Draft | Schedule releaseJump to a section:\nNFC North teams | KC's title streak\nCLE's QB room | WSH's division hopes\nBaker Mayfield's breakoutAll four NFC North teams will make the playoffsThree of them made it last season. The Lions and Vikings combined to win 29 games, dueling until the final game of the regular season to decide not only the division title, but the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. The Packers went 11-6 with the youngest roster in the league. Four of those losses were to the Lions and Vikings, and another was to the eventual Super Bowl champion Eagles.The Bears? Well, they went 5-12, but things should be different this season with former Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as their head coach. They also made a bunch of offensive personnel changes that should help kick-start the development of 2024 No. 1 pick Caleb Williams.Johnson didn't jump from the division's best team to its worst team thinking about a long-term rebuild. The Bears want to be a factor right away. And with a rebuilt offensive line, a couple of new skill players on offense and Dennis Allen coaching the defense, you can see how they might be. Since 2020 -- the first season in which the NFL's expanded playoff format made it possible -- no division has sent all four of its teams to the playoffs in the same season. But it's bound to happen at some point, and this division looks loaded.The verdict: OVERREACTIONChicago's the key to making this happen, but it still seems a little bit too soon with its current roster. The Bears play 10 games against teams that made last season's playoffs, plus games against the Cowboys and Bengals, who should be improved. Tough schedule, tough division. And even if the Bears do break through this year, their success is likely to come at the expense of at least one of their division rivals.As for the rest of the NFC, the Eagles still look awesome. The Commanders appear primed to build on last season's surprise NFC Championship Game run. The 49ers should bounce back and challenge the Rams in the NFC West. Quarterback Dak Prescott's return could make Dallas a factor in the always-unpredictable East. Heck, maybe the NFC South could get more than one team. ... OK, sorry. That's taking it too far. But the point is, it's not as if there aren't playoff-caliber teams elsewhere in the conference. It's going to be tough for the North to get four teams in.The Chiefs' streak of nine straight AFC West titles will come to an endHere's another division in which three teams made last year's playoffs. The team that didn't hired Pete Carroll as head coach and traded for QB Geno Smith. Why can't this be the division that gets all four teams in? Are the Broncos- and Chargers-shaped objects in Kansas City's rearview mirror closer than they appear?Denver beefed up its already excellent defense with Dre Greenlaw and Talanoa Hufanga, and it brought in tight end Evan Engram to give second-year QB Bo Nix another target. The Chargers added a couple of new running backs, a couple of new wide receivers and signed 6-foot-7, 363-pound guard Mekhi Becton away from the Super Bowl champs to further strengthen their offensive line.The Raiders made major upgrades at coach and quarterback. They also plan to build a running game around rookie running back Ashton Jeanty, who was one of the best players in the draft at any position. Everyone's gunning for quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, who looked wobbly at times last season and saw their flimsy pass protection get embarrassingly exposed in the Super Bowl.play1:25Why Sam Acho isn't putting anyone over the Chiefs in the AFCSam Acho explains why the Chiefs are still ahead of the Bills and Ravens in the AFC.The verdict: OVERREACTIONAs wobbly as the Chiefs looked last season, they still won 15 games in the regular season and 17 total. They finished four games ahead of the Chargers and five ahead of the Broncos in spite of conceding the final game of the season in Denver by sitting their starters.That's a ton of ground for those teams to make up, even if they both have improved their rosters. Especially because the Chiefs probably got better, too!They believe they've improved at left tackle by signing Jaylon Moore and drafting Josh Simmons in the first round. Wide receiver Rashee Rice was sentenced Thursday to 30 days in jail, which can be served at any point during a five-year probationary period, but is back from the injury that ended his season early. Additionally, Hollywood Brown is back from the ACL injury that forced him to start his season late. Add in the improvements that 2024 first-round pick Xavier Worthy made throughout last season, and Mahomes has reason to feel a lot better about his wide receiver group.A healthy running back Isiah Pacheco and a slimmed-down tight end Travis Kelce help round out a skill group determined to avenge that embarrassing Super Bowl loss. The Chiefs aren't giving this division up easily.At least three of the Browns' current quarterbacks will start games for them this seasonWithout Deshaun Watson, who's making another $46 million this season but is likely to miss most, if not all, of it while recovering from an Achilles injury, the Browns' current QB depth chart includes Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett and rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. There's a lot of speculation that one of those guys could get traded between now and the start of the season. But even if that happens, it'll still be a crowded room with more questions than answers.Odds are that one of the veterans -- Flacco or Pickett -- will open the season as the starter. But given the Browns' history at the position and that most teams use more than one starting quarterback per season, it's fair to assume the Week 1 starter won't necessarily be the same in Week 17.The verdict: NOT AN OVERREACTIONThe trade the Browns made with the Jaguars to allow Jacksonville to move up to draft Travis Hunter left Cleveland with an extra first-round pick in the 2026 draft. At that point, there will be just one year left on Watson's contract and the team surely will have moved on from the idea of him as its long-term future (if it hasn't already).With two first-rounders in a draft that's expected to be better at QB than this year's, the Browns will need to go into next offseason with some certainty about who they already have on the roster. Even if Flacco or Pickett opens the season as the starter, Cleveland needs to find out what it has in third-round pick Gabriel or fifth-round pick Sanders. It seems like an absolute slam-dunk that at least three quarterbacks will start games for the Browns this season.It's the Commanders' turn to win the NFC EastNot much was expected of the Commanders last season, but they were one of the great surprises. Led by new head coach Dan Quinn and rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, the Commanders won their final five games of the regular season (including one against the Eagles) to make the playoffs as a wild card. Then they upset the Buccaneers and Lions to advance to the NFC Championship Game.Washington's 12-5 record put the team only two games behind Philadelphia, and they traded for veterans such as left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Deebo Samuel Sr. in an effort to take the next step and maximize Daniels' rookie-contract window. The Eagles still look phenomenal and deservedly will open as the division favorites, but no team has repeated as NFC East champion since 2004. The Commanders have their sights set on bigger things in 2025.play2:16Can the Commanders surpass the Eagles in the NFC East?Mike Tannenbaum and Peter Rosenberg detail why they have the Commanders winning the NFC East.The verdict: NOT AN OVERREACTIONIt's probably actually the Giants' turn, because every other NFC East team has won the division at least three times since New York last did it in 2011. But since a Giants division title would be an even bigger surprise than what Washington did last season, let's keep it focused on the Commanders for now.Quinn took the Falcons to the Super Bowl in his second season as Atlanta's head coach, so he's not one to temper expectations. The experience Daniels got and the poise he has already shown in fourth quarters of huge games should only help him moving forward.Championship-seasoned veterans such as Bobby Wagner and Zach Ertz, who were brought in to help jump-start a fresh culture, are back for another run. Veteran cornerback Marshon Lattimore should be better than he was in his post-trade-deadline stint last season. And while there's no reason to doubt the Eagles, it's incredibly tough to repeat as champion in this division.Dallas should be better with quarterback Dak Prescott back healthy, but Washington looks to have more than the Cowboys do. It's very possible that the Commanders take another leap and finish on top in the East.Baker Mayfield will lead the Buccaneers to another division title -- and land a massive new contractThe Buccaneers have won the NFC South four years in a row -- twice with Tom Brady and twice with Mayfield. The year before that streak started, they won the Super Bowl from a wild-card spot.Tampa Bay has quietly been one of the most consistently good teams in spite of tons of changes, and Mayfield's career resurgence has been a major reason for that. The Bucs got him for next to nothing before the 2023 season, then rewarded him with a three-year, $100 million contract prior to the 2024 season.After this year, Mayfield will have one year and $27 million left on his deal. He's only 30 years old, and if he leads the Bucs to a fifth straight division title with yet another new offensive coordinator, you have to believe he'll be in line for an even bigger extension this time around.The verdict: NOT AN OVERREACTIONThe Falcons look like the top challenger, but they couldn't unseat the Bucs last season even after beating Tampa Bay in both head-to-head matchups. Wide receiver Chris Godwin should be back for the Bucs from his season-ending ankle injury, and they made one of the sneaky-good offseason pickups in edge rusher Haason Reddick.It's fair to be concerned about the potential loss of left tackle Tristan Wirfs for the first month of the season because of a knee injury, or about the offensive coordinator leaving for a head coaching job for the second offseason in a row. But it would be unfair to believe the Bucs don't have the ability to solve their own problems. Mayfield found a home in Tampa Bay and has been consistently productive since he got there. The Bucs deserve to be the division favorites. And if they win it again, Mayfield will have a strong case for a big raise."

      "content": "NFL NationJul 18, 2025, 06:00 AM ETCloseNFL Nation is made up of 32 team-specific reporters who cover the NFL year-round across ESPN.com, ESPN television shows, ESPN Radio, ESPN+ and social media platforms. It was established ahead of the 2013 season.No team has won the AFC North three consecutive years since the division was created in 2002, but ESPN BET favors the Baltimore Ravens to break that streak this season.The Ravens -- led by first-team All-Pro quarterback Lamar Jackson -- are looking for more than division glory, however. Jackson wants to celebrate success in the postseason, where his career record is 3-5, although the team's postseason disappointments weren't confined to QB play.The Pittsburgh Steelers also have a couple of people under a microscope this year. The 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers, who said this is likely his last season, will be Pittsburgh's first player over 40, and he might need to regain his MVP form to help coach Mike Tomlin snap his six-game playoff losing streak. The regular season hasn't been a problem as Tomlin has not had a losing record in 18 seasons in Pittsburgh. The Steelers' over-under is 8.5 wins, according to ESPN BET.Pittsburgh is hoping that acquiring cornerback Jalen Ramsey and tight end Jonnu Smith for safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, will pay dividends.Bengals reporter Ben Baby, Ravens reporter Jamison Hensley, Browns reporter Daniel Oyefusi and Steelers reporter Brooke Pryor take a look at the division, including who could be the top rookie this year.What's the QB outlook for each team? Joe Burrow is now more than a year and a half removed from a season-ending wrist injury that required surgery in November 2023. Recovering from the injury didn't stop him from having a huge season last year and finishing fourth in MVP voting.Burrow is in position to have an even better 2025. The Bengals re-signed his top three receiving options: Receivers Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and tight end Mike Gesicki. The offensive line should be improved with whoever wins the right guard battle. And if Burrow can be better in the fourth quarters this season, he can build on a 2024 season that saw him finish third in Total QBR behind Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen. -- Baby Jackson wants to achieve what the other three projected starting QBs in the division (assuming Flacco starts in Cleveland) have already done -- reach a Super Bowl. Jackson has nothing to prove in the regular season, where he has won two MVPs and has led the Ravens to 70 wins in seven seasons. All eyes will be on him come January. In the postseason, Jackson has committed 11 turnovers, which are the most in the playoffs since he entered the league in 2018. -- Hensley For a team coming off a three-win season, the Browns might have the league's most interesting training camp battle with their four-way quarterback competition. And it's multifaceted.Does Cleveland start the season with one of its veterans, Joe Flacco or Kenny Pickett? Is either rookie, Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders, really in position to push for the starting role in Week 1? And if not, how soon could the Browns turn to either quarterback if the season starts slow?With two first-round picks in what is expected to be a much stronger QB draft in 2026, it would behoove Cleveland to get a good evaluation of its first-year quarterbacks and see if either is worth building around. -- OyefusiAfter a prolonged decision-making process, Aaron Rodgers ultimately put off retirement for at least one more season when he signed a one-year deal with the Steelers on June 7. He said two weeks later he's \"pretty sure\" this will be his last season.Rodgers' tenure in New York was hardly what he or the Jets expected, and Pittsburgh represents an opportunity to distance himself from that tumultuous period. In 2024, Rodgers' first season since a left Achilles tear, the quarterback averaged 2.69 seconds to throw (fifth fastest among qualified QBs) and a 6.6-yard average throw distance (fifth shortest in the league), per ESPN Research. It marked Rodgers' only full season as a starter where he recorded an average throw distance below 7.4 yards.Another year removed from the Achilles injury, 2025 could be the perfect way for Rodgers to end his Hall of Fame career, or it could add another disappointing closing chapter to his legacy. -- PryorWhat pressure is each coach facing this season? Zac Taylor: There are two major pressure points facing Taylor this season. First, the Bengals need to end their two-year postseason drought and become relevant in the AFC again. The lackluster 2024 campaign forced Taylor to shake up his coaching staff and replace defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo with Al Golden, a former assistant during Cincinnati's 2021 Super Bowl run.The other source of pressure is the Bengals need to have an even better offense. Cincinnati's passing trio of Burrow, Higgins and Chase earn a combined $124 million in average annual salary. That should yield the No. 1 offense in the NFL and a team that can bludgeon opponents each week. Last year, the Bengals were eighth in the league in points per drive, which is good. But Taylor will be tasked with maximizing all aspects of this team in 2025. -- Baby John Harbaugh: For Harbaugh, the challenge is to get his players to come through in the clutch in the postseason. The reason why Baltimore hasn't been to a Super Bowl since 2012 is uncharacteristic mistakes like wide receiver Zay Flowers fumbling near the goal line in the 2023 AFC Championship Game and tight end Mark Andrews dropping a critical 2-point conversion in the final minutes of the AFC divisional round.As Harbaugh put it at the end of last season, \"you keep striving forward to stack those games together and put three or four really good games together, error-free games together, and go ahead and win a Super Bowl.\" -- Hensley Kevin Stefanski: Despite the Browns' struggles last season, owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam gave a strong endorsement at the owners meeting for Stefanski, a two-time Coach of the Year award winner who received an extension 13 months ago.Ownership acknowledged the franchise is retooling after the trade for quarterback Deshaun Watson, which Jimmy Haslam called a \"big swing-and-miss,\" and wants to give Stefanski time to do so. But the Haslams emphasized that they are still looking to compete. Stefanski is at the forefront of those efforts, as he's taking back playcalling duties and the Browns are returning to the offensive scheme he operated in his first few seasons as head coach. -- Oyefusi Mike Tomlin: With a three-year extension that kicks in this season, Tomlin likely isn't going anywhere no matter what happens on the field in 2025. But his legacy could take a hit if the Rodgers experiment fails.It marks the second year in a row Tomlin led the charge to bring in an aging quarterback in an attempt to end the ever-growing playoff-loss streak, which dates back to 2016. In 2024, he was the driver of the decision to put Russell Wilson in \"pole position\" for the starting quarterback job and to supplant Justin Fields once Wilson's calf healed. Tomlin, who hasn't had a losing season during his 18 years in Pittsburgh, deserves significant credit for doing more with less over the years, but he should also take the heat when his gambles don't pay off. -- PryorWill the Ravens be the first AFC North team to three-peat? No. The Bengals did not have a very good year last season and still finished 9-8. That is despite blowing two second-half leads to the Ravens that ultimately cost the Bengals a shot at the division title.Cincinnati should be in a position to not only contend for the division crown but also take full advantage of a schedule that is ranked the 14th-hardest after a third-place finish last year. The Bengals also retooled their team to be significantly better against AFC North opponents, especially when it comes to being better defensively near the line of scrimmage. Adding T.J. Slaton in the middle should help solidify Cincinnati's run defense for those big games against the Ravens. -- Baby Yes, as long as Jackson stays healthy. Of the five regular seasons that Jackson has finished, the Ravens have won four AFC North titles. The only exception was 2020, when Baltimore was second in the division.With Jackson as its starting quarterback, Baltimore is 20-9 (.690) in the AFC North, putting up an impressive 27.9 points per game. Plus, this has the makings of being the Ravens' most complete team in his eight seasons. -- Hensley Yes. The road to a division three-peat will be as tough as ever for the Ravens. The Bengals' defense has nowhere to go but up, and the Burrow-Chase-Higgins trio always gives Baltimore all it can handle. The Steelers' defense has often been a conundrum for Jackson and now Pittsburgh has added Rodgers. However, the Ravens have what is arguably the franchise's best roster in the Jackson era, a team filled with not only star power but well-rounded depth in key spots. The AFC North will be a grind, as it always is, but Baltimore will emerge as division champs again. -- OyefusiYes. Sorry to the Steelers fans reading this, but the Ravens are the division's most complete team. The Bengals are the Ravens' biggest three-peat threat, but as the rosters stand now with the Bengals' contract drama, the Ravens have the strongest identity and foundation in the division. That could help them get out to a faster start and establish an early division lead with a Week 2 game against the Browns and two more AFC opponents in the first four weeks. -- PryorWho will be the best rookie in the division? Ravens safety Malaki Starks: Putting him in the same secondary as Kyle Hamilton should be a very dynamic pairing.Browns tight end Harold Fannin Jr. is someone I was intrigued with throughout the entire draft process. At Bowling Green last season, he put up big performances against Penn State and Texas A&M, two Power 4 teams that have a ton of NFL-level talent. Bowling Green did a good job of putting Fannin in space and creating favorable matchups. Stefanski has done a good job of that over the years.I also want to see how defensive tackle Derrick Harmon and running back Kaleb Johnson look in Pittsburgh this season. -- Baby Starks. The Bengals are in a contract impasse with Shemar Stewart, and the Browns and Steelers each selected defensive linemen (Mason Graham and Harmon) in the first round. Starks, who has been working with the Ravens starters since he stepped foot in Baltimore, has an opportunity to make the biggest splash of all the AFC North top selections.Baltimore has a history of identifying playmaking defensive backs. Two of the previous three safeties drafted by the Ravens in the first round became first-team All-Pro selections: Ed Reed and Hamilton. -- HensleyStarks. The former Georgia standout was a perfect fit for a Ravens defense that needed to shore up the back end while also freeing Hamilton to be more versatile and work closer to the line of scrimmage. Starks should have plenty of opportunities to use his range and make plays on the ball. -- Oyefusi Starks. I'll make it 4-for-4 and also go with Starks. No pressure! In joining a secondary with Hamilton and Marlon Humphrey, Starks is undeniably drafted into the best spot of any rookie in the AFC North, plus the Ravens have a great track record of identifying and further developing good safeties.But there's also a strong case to be made for Harmon, whom defensive line coach Karl Dunbar already tapped as the starting left defensive tackle. Harmon figures to be the future of the defensive line along with Keeanu Benton once Cameron Heyward eventually retires, but Harmon could start making a big impact this year. -- PryorWhich starting job (outside of QB) on the team you cover remains the biggest question mark? Right guard. Cody Ford and Lucas Patrick appear to be the primary candidates in contention for that job. Cordell Volson, who was previously the team's left guard, has plenty of starting experience and has potential to grow and improve under new assistant coach Scott Peters.Of those three, the Bengals have the most invested in Ford. Patrick, who was previously with the New Orleans Saints, signed a one-year deal in free agency but received just $200,000 in guaranteed money. Ford, on the other hand, signed a two-year deal with $1 million guaranteed, according to Roster Management System. With the addition of rookie Dylan Fairchild to play left guard, Cincinnati could have two new starting offensive linemen this season. -- Baby Kicker. It speaks to the strength of the Ravens' roster when the biggest question lies outside offense and defense. Baltimore is looking for a new kicker for the first time in 14 years after cutting Justin Tucker in May amid an investigation by the league for sexual misconduct. Tucker subsequently received a 10-week ban.Instead of Baltimore signing a veteran, the Ravens' competition to replace the NFL's most accurate kicker will be between rookie sixth-round pick Tyler Loop and undrafted rookie John Hoyland. Loop, who is considered the favorite, was nearly perfect this offseason before struggling late in spring workouts. -- Hensley WR2. Jerry Jeudy had a breakout season in 2024, but the Browns don't have a proven option outside of him. Diontae Johnson is long removed from being named a Pro Bowler in 2021 and is joining his fourth team in two years. Young pass-catchers Cedric Tillman and Jamari Thrash have shown flashes but have a combined 53 career catches.One or two of these players will have to step up for the eventual winner of the Browns' four-man QB competition. -- Oyefusi WR2. The Steelers briefly had a strong wide receiver tandem in the month and a half between acquiring DK Metcalf and trading George Pickens. With Pickens' departure for Dallas, the Steelers once again have a question mark at the No. 2 wide receiver spot with few internal options to fill the role.At minicamp, wide receivers coach Zach Azzanni said fourth-year receiver Calvin Austin III is the team's WR2. While Austin averaged 15.2 yards per catch last season, just below Pickens' 15.3 YPC, he still averaged only 32.2 yards per game with four receiving touchdowns. The Steelers brought in veteran Robert Woods on a one-year deal, but they could also look at signing another free agent like Keenan Allen or acquiring more help via trade. -- Pryor"

      "content": "Nick ParkinsonJul 19, 2025, 06:28 PM ETCloseReports on boxing for ESPN.com and has been covering British boxing for over 25 years.LONDON -- With his magnificent Round 5 demolition of Daniel Dubois on Saturday, Oleksandr Usyk provided more convincing evidence why he should be considered the best heavyweight since Lennox Lewis.The left hook that left Dubois (22-3, 21 KOs) in a crumpled heap in front of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium was a thing of beauty, which fittingly sealed Usyk's second reign as undisputed world heavyweight champion. Usyk also dropped Dubois to the canvas earlier in Round 5 with a right hand in an utterly imperious performance from the Ukrainian.As long as Usyk (24-0, 15 KOs) does not lose a potential trilogy fight with Tyson Fury in April 2026, or another title defence later this year probably against former WBO titleholder Joseph Parker, the undisputed heavyweight king will go down in history as the best heavyweight for the past two decades. Not only that, Usyk can also be considered the best cruiserweight for three decades since the likes of Dwight Muhammad Qawi and Evander Holyfield ruled in the mid-1980s.Usyk was the first undisputed cruiserweight champion and reigned the division from 2016 to 2018, before stepping up to heavyweight. He has now made five heavyweight title defences against top level opponents -- former champions and current champions.Usyk's achievements at heavyweight have surpassed what he managed at cruiserweight, and he has beaten the best of his era (Fury, Dubois and Anthony Joshua) -- twice --  to put any arguments beyond doubt as to who is the best. Dubois argued he scored a legitimate body punch in their first encounter two years ago, but it was (rightly) ruled a low blow. Usyk overwhelmed the big-punching, spirited Briton the rest of the fight for a ninth-round TKO, and in the rematch produced an even more emphatic conclusion.Parker (36-3, 24 KOs), 33, will beat his friend Fury to Usyk it seems, as WBO mandatory challenger.\"The WBO say he has to fight Joseph Parker next, so that will be the fight,\" Queensberry Promotions promoter Frank Warren said.It is hard to envisage how a resurgent Parker, who is in the best form of his life, will threaten Usyk's legacy.Parker won the WBO belt with a points decision over Andy Ruiz in 2016, then lost it in a third defence and title unification fight versus Anthony Joshua in March 2018. Impressive wins over Deontay Wilder, Zhilei Zhang and Martin Bakole in the last two years have resurrected Parker's career, but Usyk's ring IQ, movement and sublime skills are on a different level to Parker and the others.Fury and Joshua, both two-time world champions, had good wins over Wladimir Klitschko, and Fury also stopped the dangerous puncher Wilder twice in world title fights.But Usyk's unblemished record, with a total 13 world title fight victories as well as a 2012 Olympic gold medal, stacks up better. Usyk's fellow countrymen Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, with their superior reach and height could well have made things difficult for Usyk.Wladimir's jab-and-grab strategy was impregnable at times during his nine-and-a-half year reign, and it may have frustrated Usyk to the point of defeat. Vitali and Wladimir ruled the heavyweight division between them, holding all the belts at one time, from 2004 when Vitali became champion following his loss on cuts to Lewis in 2003, to when Fury boxed the ears off Wladimir in 2015.Wladimir made a staggering 18 title defences in a second reign as unified world champion (2006-2015), with his best wins over David Haye, Alexander Povetkin and Jean Marc Mormeck. Vitali (45-2, 41 KOs) made two defences of the WBO belt, before 10 defences over two reigns as WBC champion, which were interrupted by injury, with destructive wins over Samuel Peter, Danny Williams and Herbie Hide.- Usyk knocks out Dubois to become undisputed heavyweight champion\n- In camp with Oleksandr Usyk: Behind the scenes with a heavyweight champion\n- Fight results: Usyk stops Dubois, regains undisputed championshipThe Klitschko brothers' numbers are greater than those so far compiled by Usyk (23-0, 14 KOs), who has made five heavyweight title defences and six cruiserweight title defences. But Usyk has better names on his record, and is a three-time undisputed world champion.Usyk became the first recognised undisputed world heavyweight champion since Lewis (41-2, 32 KOs), who beat such fighters as all-time greats Holyfield, Mike Tyson and Klitschko over three reigns as champion, with 17 wins, 2 losses, and 1 draw in world heavyweight title fights.Like Vitali, Wladimir and Lewis, Usyk launched his professional career off the back of an Olympic gold medal triumph and as he closes in on the end of his career, whether it is later this year against Parker or next year against Fury, his legacy looks the strongest of any heavyweight since Lewis."

      "content": "Dan WetzelJul 18, 2025, 07:00 AM ETCloseDan Wetzel is a senior writer focused on investigative reporting, news analysis and feature storytelling.During college football's Bowl Championship Series era, the sport's opposition to an expanded, let alone expansive, playoff could be summarized in one colorful quote by then-Ohio State president E. Gordon Gee.\"They will wrench a playoff system out of my cold, dead hands,\" Gee said in 2007.We are happy to report that while college football does, indeed, have a playoff, Gee is still very much alive. The 81-year-old retired just this week after a second stint leading West Virginia University.What is dead and buried, though, is college football's staunch resistance to extending its postseason field. After decades of ignoring complaints and the promise of additional revenue to claim that just two teams was more than enough, plans to move from 12 participants to 16 were underway before last season's inaugural 12-teamer even took place.A once-static sport now moves at light speed, future implications be damned.Fire. Ready. Aim.So maybe the best bit of current news is that college football's two ruling parties -- the SEC and Big Ten -- can't agree on how the new 16-team field would be selected. It has led to a pause on playoff expansion.Maybe, just maybe, it means no expansion will occur by 2026, as first planned, and college football can let the 12-team model cook a little to accurately assess what changes -- if any -- are even needed.\"We have a 12-team playoff, five conference champions,\" SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said this week. \"That could stay if we can't agree.\"Good. After all, what's the rush?The 2025 season will play out with a 12-team format featuring automatic bids for five conference champions and seven at-large spots. Gone is last year's clunky requirement that the top four seeds could go only to conference champs -- elevating Boise State and Arizona State and unbalancing the field.That alone was progress built on real-world experience. It should be instructive.The SEC wants a 16-team model but with, as is currently the case, automatic bids going to the champions in the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, SEC and the best of the so-called Group of 6. The rest of the field would be at-large selections.The Big Ten says it will not back such a proposal until the SEC agrees to play nine conference games (up from its current eight). Instead, it wants a 16-team system that gives four automatic bids apiece to the Big Ten and SEC, two each to the ACC and Big 12, one to the Group of 6 and then three at-large spots.It's been dubbed the \"4-4-2-2-1-3\" because college athletic leaders love ridiculous parlances almost as much as they love money.While the ACC, Big 12 and others have offered opinions -- mostly siding with the SEC -- legislatively, the decision rests with the sport's two big-dog conferences.Right now, neither side is budging. A compromise might still be made, of course. The supposed deadline to set the 2026 system is Nov. 30. And Sankey actually says he prefers the nine-game SEC schedule, even if his coaches oppose it.However, the possibility of the status quo standing for a bit longer remains.What the Big Ten has proposed is a dramatic shift for a sport that has been bombarded with dramatic shifts -- conference realignment, the transfer portal, NIL, revenue sharing, etc.The league wants to stage multiple \"play-in\" games on conference championship weekend. The top two teams in the league would meet for the league title (as is currently the case), but the third- and fourth-place teams would play the fifth- and sixth-place teams to determine the other automatic bids.Extend this out among all the conferences and you have up to a 26-team College Football Playoff (with 22 teams in a play-in situation). This would dramatically change the way the sport works -- devaluing the stakes for nonconference games, for example. And some mediocre teams would essentially get a playoff bid -- in the Big Ten's case, the sixth seed last year was an Iowa team that finished 8-5.Each conference would have more high-value inventory to sell to broadcast partners, but it's not some enormous windfall. Likewise, four more first-round playoff games would need to find television slots and relevance.Is anyone sure this is necessary? Do we need 16 at all, let alone with multibids?In the 12-team format, the first round wasn't particularly competitive -- with a 19.3-point average margin of victory. It's much like the first round of the NFL playoffs, designed mostly to make sure no true contender is left out.Perhaps last year was an outlier. And maybe future games will be close. Or maybe they'll be even more lopsided. Wouldn't it be prudent to find out?While there were complaints about the selection committee picking SMU and/or Indiana over Alabama, it wasn't some egregious slight. Arguments will happen no matter how big the field. Besides, the Crimson Tide lost to two 6-6 teams last year. Expansion means a team with a similar résumé can cruise in.Is that a good thing?Whatever the decision, it is being made with little to no real-world data -- pro or con. Letting a few 12-team fields play out, providing context and potentially unexpected consequences, sure wouldn't hurt.You don't have to be Gordon Gee circa 2007 to favor letting this simmer and be studied before leaping toward another round of expansion."

      "content": "ESPN News ServicesJul 19, 2025, 04:18 PM ETPORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- The question Scottie Scheffler was asking of himself at the start of the week could very well be posed to those chasing him in the British Open.What's the point?Scheffler delivered another example Saturday at Royal Portrush of why he has dominated golf the last three years. He was the only player in the last eight groups not to make a bogey on his way to a 4-under 67 that allowed him to open a four-shot lead as he goes for the third leg of the career Grand Slam.Scheffler has won the last 10 times he has led after 54 holes. It's never easy, no matter how he makes it look. But on this gorgeous day he was in full command of his game, and he now is in prime position to get his second major win of the year.He was helped by a 6-iron to 10 feet for eagle on the par-5 seventh, and saved by three big par saves, two on the back nine, to keep everyone at a distance.\"Talking of execution, he's probably the best in the business right now,\" Rory McIlroy said after a 5-under 66 that brought him to only within six shots of Scheffler.Scheffler had the golf world buzzing earlier this week when he said celebrations don't last but a few minutes. He loves the competition. He loves the work. But in terms of fulfillment, he often questions why he wants to win so badly when the thrill of winning is fleeting.Ahead of him is competition, and still plenty of work.He was at 14-under 199, four shots ahead of Haotong Li of China, who delivered his own mystery by saying he had no idea how he recovered from the full swing yips a few years ago to be in the final group of a major for the first time.Another shot back was Matt Fitzpatrick, who was tied with Scheffler through six holes but couldn't stay with him when the No. 1 player began to pull away. Fitzpatrick missed a pair of short par putts and had to settle for a par 71.The biggest roars belonged to McIlroy, so much that it felt as though all of Northern Ireland was behind him. He opened with three birdies in four holes. The roar that shook Royal Portrush came on the par-5 12th when McIlroy holed a 55-foot eagle putt that gave him a spark and the gallery hope -- even though he still was six behind.He produced only one more birdie the rest of the way and still faced a big climb.\"I played well enough today to at least feel like I have a chance tomorrow,\" McIlroy said. \"Yeah, it's going to be tough to catch him tomorrow if he keeps playing the way he does. But if I can get out tomorrow and get off to a similar start to what I did today, get the crowd going ... you never know. But I just need to go out and play another really good round of golf tomorrow and see what happens.\"But this championship is now in the hands of Scheffler, who has been No. 1 in the world longer than anyone since Tiger Woods. And there was nothing Saturday to indicate he was going to make it easy on anyone chasing him.\"I'm just trying to execute, not overthinking things,\" Scheffler said. \"I feel like I've been doing the right thing so far, and I'm looking forward to the challenge of tomorrow.\"After his first three-putt of the tournament -- making par after reaching the par-5 second hole in two shots -- Scheffler made a 10-foot par putt that was as big as any. In deep trouble behind the 11th green, he hacked out to 10 feet to save par, then saved another par from the deep grass left of the 14th fairway.Royal Portrush has a nasty par-3 at No. 16 known as \"Calamity Corner.\" Scheffler made birdie there for the third straight day, this time a 3-iron that settled 15 feet below the cup.Each shot helped him pull away from the field. Each shot moved him closer to the Claret Jug, to go along with the PGA Championship he won by 5 shots in May and the two Masters green jackets he has won in the last four years.In fact, if Scheffler maintains his advantage Sunday, he'd join Ben Hogan in 1953 and Woods in 2000 as the only golfers to win multiple majors by four or more strokes in the same year.\"Scottie is ... it's inevitable,\" McIlroy said. \"Even when he doesn't have his best stuff, he's become a complete player.\"This is what McIlroy noticed last year, when Scheffler won nine times around the world. What impressed him was that Scheffler played so many bogey-free rounds.Scheffler picked a great time for another one.\"I think the card could look stress-free, but I had two really nice par saves on the back nine that were key ... two really important putts,\" he said. \"I think any time you can keep a clean card around a major championship, you're going to be having a pretty good day.\"Fitzpatrick did his best to keep pace, but he missed a 4-foot par putt on the 13th, got a bad bounce on the 17th that led to another bogey and wound up five shots behind.\"Just didn't make any putts. I didn't hit it close enough,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"Drove it well enough, didn't hit it close enough. Just made way less putts than Scottie.\"Scheffler will be paired in the last group with Li, who made history in 2020 at the PGA Championship when he held the 36-hole lead, becoming the first player from China to lead in a major. Li didn't make his first bogey until the 13th hole, and he dropped another shot on the 18th by driving into a pot bunker.Scottish Open champion Chris Gotterup, in his first appearance in the British Open, had a 68 and joined the group at 8-under 205 that included McIlroy, Harris English (68) and Tyrrell Hatton (68).This is Scheffler's largest 54-hole lead in a major -- he was up by three shots at the PGA Championship and in the 2022 Masters.Information from ESPN Research and The Associated Press was used in this report."

      "content": "Nick ParkinsonJul 19, 2025, 05:47 PM ETCloseReports on boxing for ESPN.com and has been covering British boxing for over 25 years.LONDON -- Oleksandr Usyk ruthlessly knocked out Daniel Dubois in Round 5 to become the undisputed world heavyweight champion again Saturday.The Ukrainian became the first men's boxer to become an undisputed champion for a third time, following previous reigns at cruiserweight (2018) and heavyweight (2024), after he floored Dubois twice in Round 5 in front of approximately 90,000 at Wembley Stadium.Usyk won Dubois' IBF title, to add to his WBC, WBA and WBO belts, in a fifth title defence.Usyk first sent Dubois to the canvas with a right to the head for a count before flattening Dubois with a left hook.It was proof (if proof were needed) that Usyk is the best heavyweight of his generation, having previously beaten former champions Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury twice each.After Usyk claimed earlier this year that Dubois would be his penultimate fight, the scramble now begins to face the 38-year-old in late 2025 before he retires.However, Fury recently claimed he will make his ring return vs. Usyk in April next year, after losing to the Ukrainian on points in December 2024.\"Thirty-eight is a young guy, 38 is only the start,\" Usyk said in the ring after.\"Maybe Tyson Fury,\" Usyk said when asked who he will fight next.\"Maybe Derek Chisora, maybe Anthony Joshua, maybe Joseph Parker, I don't know.\"Dubois, 27, from Greenwich in south London, lost the belt in a second title defence, having been promoted to full champion from interim status after Usyk gave up the IBF belt last year. The Londoner was unable to repeat the heroics of last September, when he sent Joshua to the canvas four times in a Round 5 KO win. In contrast to that coruscating win, Dubois was left counted out in a fight Usyk dictated from the start.It was even better than the last time Usyk defeated Dubois, by Round 9 stoppage, in August 2023 and he is now expected to box again later this year, possibly against New Zealand's Joseph Parker.Since being stopped in Round 9 by Usyk in August 2023, Dubois has been much improved, with stoppage wins over Jarrell Miller, Filip Hrgovic and Joshua. But he was unable to establish any authority in front of his home fans.Usyk was quickly into his rhythm and did most of the work in Round 1, piercing Dubois' guard with his southpaw jab.Dubois, who is 11 years younger than Usyk and weighed in 26 pounds heavier than Usyk, put together a strong series of punches late in Round 1.But Usyk produced some quality work in Round 2, as he slipped Dubois punches to repeatedly land solid left hands.A big left hook momentarily shook Dubois in Round 3, as Usyk's smart movement denied Dubois any openings.Usyk complained about a low blow in Round 4 before a strong finish to the round. In Round 5, Usyk landed a left-right combination as Dubois began to look more open and a glancing right to the head sent Dubois to his knees for the first count.Moments after Dubois got up, Usyk finished it. After Dubois missed with a right hand, Usyk uncorked a sweeping left hook to return the Englishman to the canvas. Dubois was left flat on his back and was counted out.It was a smart, savage and scintillating stoppage from imperious Usyk who is beyond reach it seems for any of the current heavyweights."

It's an unlikely story as he looks to become the first player from China to win a men's major - and only the third from Asia after Hideki Matsuyama and Yang Yong-eun.It would be a remarkable turn of events if Li could chase down the world number one, who holds a four-stroke advantage heading into the final round, and the 29-year-old has had a rollercoaster career to date.He has even been dubbed the \"most handsome man in China\".In a county of 1.4 billion people, that is quite the claim. Although according to Li, he was not the one who started it.It appears his club manufacturer randomly stamped it on one of his wedges as a joke and now it's stuck. He even revealed on Friday that he text a picture of his wedge to Phil Mickelson, who replied that it was a \"shame\" for China. \"It was fun\", said Li.Li came an impressive third on his Open debut in 2017 but things had not gone to plan since. He was tied for 39th the following year but had failed to even make the cut at the championship since. However, that changed this week when he vaulted up the leaderboard with a strong opening round of 67, replicated that score in his second outing, then produced another solid third round of 69 on Saturday to leave him in second place with 18 holes to play.It's clear that Li prefers to do his talking on the course. And the fact he is in this position says a lot about his resilience. He almost walked away from the sport in 2021 after a loss of form and injury, but bounced back to win the BMW Invitational Open the following June.His form at Royal Portrush hasn't come as a total surprise as he worked his way back up the rankings to 111 in the world and ended a near three-year wait for a title when he won the Qatar International in February.After his third round, Li said he was struggling with his swing and the \"yips\" over the past two years.He said he did not know how he had bounced back but said it was a \"miracle\".'I felt really bad' before OpenImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Li has emerged as an unlikely contender in Northern IrelandTo make his Open performance even more remarkable, Li said he restricted a lot of his practice to the range due to the size of the crowds in Portrush. \"I'll tell you what, the last couple weeks, I felt really, really bad to be honest,\" Li admitted. \"This week I hardly got on the course to play because I felt like there were so many people, with course being so packed.\"I just kind of hit a few balls on the range and wasn't comfortable. Even on our Thursday and Friday morning sessions, I wasn't. \"But until today, it was actually quite nice.\"It's a feeling he will have to get used to. Unlike at the 2020 PGA Championship, when he led after 36 holes but fell away, he has stayed in touch in Northern Ireland.And now, for the first time in his career he will head out on the closing day of a major in the final pairing. All eyes will be on him, but it's a challenge he plans to embrace as he looks to shock Scheffler. \"I'm actually quite looking forward to it,\" he said.\"I'll just try to play my best out there and hopefully make something happen.\"It's going to be exciting.\"As the underdog against the sport's heavy hitters, Li admits he has nothing to lose. But as he said on Friday: \"I think if I play my best, I can compete with anyone.\""

      "content": "Media caption, Watch all the penalties as England beat SwedenEmma SmithBBC Sport journalistThe penalty shootout between England and Sweden at Euro 2025 will go down as one of the most dramatic in football history.Of the 14 spot-kicks taken, only five were scored, with six saved and three missed for a conversion rate of just 35.7%.A bizarre outlier? Not so much. At Euro 2025, penalties have been far from a guaranteed source of goals, with a tournament success rate of 58.5%.Spain failed to score either of their two penalties against Switzerland on Friday, and Germany had one saved in normal time when they faced France, before another three went awry in a 14-penalty shootout that admittedly lacked the chaos of England v Sweden.The success rate is the lowest at this stage of a women's tournament in the past 15 years. In comparison, 84.4% of penalties were scored at 2015 World Cup.Across the seven major women's tournaments since 2011 and before Euro 2025, the success rate was 72.99% - slightly up on the 70.56% scored in men's competitions since 2010. So why are penalties now so much harder to score at major women's tournaments? BBC Sport dug into the stats, asked the players and managers, and quizzed the experts to try to find an answer.More interest, greater expectationsThere is no question there is greater interest in women's football than ever before, particularly in England since they won Euro 2022.A total of 7.4 million people watched their 2025 quarter-final against the Swedes on BBC One, and there has been a growth in media interest in the past three years.Women's Super League games are now played at larger stadiums, and many of the Lionesses are household names.Being put under a greater spotlight could be a major factor in missed penalties, according to Geir Jordet - professor of football and psychology at the Norwegian School of Sports Science, and author of Pressure: Lessons from the Psychology of the Penalty Shootout.\"We know from research that penalty takers are vulnerable to pressure,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Most of this research has been done on men, but when pressure goes up, performance goes down.\"It is interesting in the women's game... the interest has exploded in the past five years. I am curious about whether that has an effect on these players.\"Of course there are exceptions, and in the WSL a lot of people watch some games. But Premier League players perform for 50,000 every week and to millions at home. That is new to these players.\"I'm not saying female players are worse under pressure, I am saying the pressure is relatively speaking higher now than it used to be. You need to experience this to find the ways to cope with that.\"There is so much learning taking place, and I think women's teams are more ready to absorb this. Football is more conservative on the men's side.\"Jordet's theory seems to have some basis in reality, with England forward Chloe Kelly saying their ability to perform under pressure gave them the edge.England have now won all three shootouts under Sarina Wiegman - against Sweden, Nigeria at the 2023 World Cup, and Brazil at the Finalissima at Wembley.They have also reached at least the semi-finals of every World Cup and Euros since 2015.Importance of dataWhile increased interest in women's football adds to the pressure, it also brings increased finances - allowing for more research and coaching.Players by and large try to perfect a particular style of penalty, and work on that in training and games. But thanks to better scouting and data analysis, opponents can anticipate their moves with a greater degree of accuracy too.Sweden keeper Jennifer Falk had a list of England's takers and their penalty style on her water bottle - and saved four spot-kicks in the shootout.The 32-year-old and her England counterpart Hannah Hampton both went the right way for five of the seven kicks they faced.Germany's Ann-Katrin Berger followed the same method as Falk, with TV cameras picking out her list during extra time. \"The takers have been rigorously mapped out - the keepers know these takers more now than in the past,\" said Jordet.\"If you add the pressure, takers tend to fall back on a default pattern and will shoot in the way they are most comfortable doing.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sweden keeper Jennifer Falk had details about England's penalty takers on a note strapped to her water bottleAs in men's football, there is still a school of thought that penalties are a lottery and practice can never make perfect.Speaking before the match against England, Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson said: \"Somewhere it is a personal responsibility. The players who want to practise penalties can, but we haven't set up anything. \"It is one of the most difficult moments in football. It is so difficult to prepare.\"That is a rare - and perhaps outdated - approach, though, and not one England subscribe to.Asked how much they had prepared for penalties, captain Leah Williamson said: \"Loads.\"I know there were a few more misses than normal, but everybody does [that]. It's something you have to box off before a tournament.\"Keepers 'finding ways to be smarter'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England keeper Hannah Hampton saved two Sweden penalties, and five shots during the game itselfAs well as being better prepared, Jordet also feels female goalkeepers are more capable physically, thus allowing them to more easily save penalties.\"For a long time, goalkeeping has been less developed in the women's game,\" he explained. \"There are physical limitations such as height and it is more difficult to defend the goal than male counterparts.\"But now with increased professionalisation, they are finding ways to be smarter, to read their opponents.\"For years, critics of women's football have gleefully posted videos of goalkeepers struggling to stop tame shots, or posted on social media and under online articles how women should play with smaller goals or pitches.But whether it was the five saves Hampton made on Thursday against Sweden, the four penalties stopped by Falk, or the absence of amateur keepers at the Euros, there is less evidence to support that view.Indeed, when Falk herself stepped up to take the fifth penalty against England, Hampton was worried as the Lionesses had not prepared for how she would take them.\"I think sometimes keepers don't get enough credit,\" England back-up goalkeeper Khiara Keating told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"Obviously there's the backstage things that you don't see - the analysis, the hard work in training, the reading, the body language. The keeper standard is getting way better.\"What does the future hold?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The penalty sent wide by Spain's Mariona Caldentey (number eight) against Switzerland was the fourth missed out of 11 spot-kicks during regular play at Euro 2025Of course, there is some truth in the old adage of penalties being a lottery. Of all things in the micromanaged world of modern football, luck remains a key ingredient.\"There may be no real reason, it could be random,\" admitted Jordet. \"Another 25 penalties and it might even out.\"That was Gerhardsson's primary excuse after his side became the first team at a women's Euros to lose a penalty shootout after their opponents missed three of their own kicks.\"You might take five penalty kicks a year and you might be 3-0 up,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, you don't have anyone who would like to take a penalty.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lucy Bronze was the fifth and final player to score a penalty in England's 3-2 shootout win over SwedenBut as women's football continues to rise from the ashes of a 50-year ban, technique all over the pitch will improve, and styles of penalty-taking more common in men's football will emerge.This includes what Jordet called the \"keeper-dependent technique\", where a player steps up to the ball, looks at the keeper and where they move, then rolls it the other way.It is commonly seen from players such as Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski, yet very rarely in women's football.None of the 14 takers in the Sweden-England tie waited for the keeper to move. Spain's Mariona Caldentey demonstrated the downside of that method, though, during her side's 2-0 last-eight win as Switzerland keeper Livia Peng called her bluff, did not move and dived the right way as the penalty rolled wide of the target.But we should expect to see more flexibility and a better penalty technique in women's football - and it was that adaptability that ultimately helped England progress.Lucy Bronze scored their decisive penalty with a strike measured at more than 63mph, although she later revealed to BBC Sport this was not her original plan.\"I hurt my leg a little bit in the game, so I kind of changed my mind,\" said the Chelsea full-back.\"Also I watched the goalkeeper in every single penalty and she dived quite early, and statistically in a shootout it's quite risky for the keeper to stand still and [someone] go down the middle.\"So yeah, I love maths.\""

Neither departure will be at a cut price.A deal for the 23-year-old Ekitike, who has an £86m release clause in his contract with Frankfurt, continues to be negotiated despite reports of Alexander Isak, in whom Liverpool are known to be interested, being unsettled at Newcastle. Eddie Howe left the Swede out of the squad that lost 4‑0 at Celtic in a pre‑season friendly on Saturday, with the manager admitting later it was because of recent transfer speculation. Howe did go on to say, however, that he was “confident [Isak] will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window”.Liverpool are prepared to pay a British record transfer fee to make Isak their new No 9 but the chances of them signing – or indeed being able to afford – the 25-year-old forward remain remote, hence the stepping up of their interest in Ekitike.Isak has also been linked with Arsenal, as previously was Ekitike, who scored 22 goals and provided 12 assists in all competitions for Frankfurt last season.Liverpool have already signed Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez this summer, with Giorgi Mamardashvili linking up with the club after agreeing a move last August."

However, Bueckers joked that she is not going to be an easy guest to book.\"She might ask me. I might say yes. I might say no. We'll see,\" Bueckers said in a phone interview with CBS Sports.Regardless of the jokes, Bueckers is likely going to be one of the biggest supporters of the podcast because she has been Fudd's No. 1 fan for a while. During the NCAA Tournament, Bueckers talked about how talented she is and said \"everyone alive should believe in her.\"\"I'm expecting her podcast to be great,\" Bueckers said. \"I'm excited that she gets to have that platform to talk a little bit more about who she is on and off the court.

However, it was also a big weekend for the duo because it appears they finally confirmed their long-rumored relationship. During the orange carpet Thursday, Bueckers answered questions about her \"D-I girlfriend\" and all of them were specifically about Fudd's accomplishments. The Dallas Wings rookie answered everything correctly with hardly any hesitation, and at the end of the Wagtalk video Bueckers names Fudd when asked for the \"girlfriend reveal.\"Whether Bueckers is a podcast guest soon is yet to be seen. However, Fudd will definitely be talking about her because the teaser mentioned how Bueckers believes anything Fudd says and could even convince herself that the Earth is flat. \n        \n\nBueckers will tip off her first WNBA All-Star Game on Saturday at 8:30 p.m. ET.

But he may be forced into a reshuffle in Melbourne. “I thought we got the start really right, especially the forward pack,” said the inside-centre Sione Tuipulotu. “The way they were knocking them back in the first 10 minutes sucked the life out of the Wallabies. Credit mainly to the forward pack, the way they started that game and really nipped them in the bud.”Farrell was quick to warn his players to beware of wounded Wallabies this week, referring to the 2013 tour when the Lions won the opener in Brisbane before Australia levelled the series in Melbourne.

We’ve still got a lot to work on.“They have to be [desperate], don’t they?

      "content": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Australia are 1-0 down going into Saturday's second TestTom EnglishBBC Sport in Australia There was no mistaking the word of the night at the Suncorp Stadium after the British and Irish Lions' first Test win over Australia - desperation. As in, Wallaby desperation. As in, they'll be so desperate to keep the series alive in Melbourne on Saturday they'll metamorphose into a team of belligerence and belief - a band of brothers who will blow the Lions away.\"We expect them to be desperate,\" said Lions centre Sione Tuipulotu after the 27-19 victory.\"When an Australia team becomes desperate, it's difficult to handle,\" said head coach Andy Farrell. \"The desperation is all on the line for them at the weekend,\" said prop Tadhg Furlong.Flanker Tadhg Beirne also spoke about Australian desperation. So did Wallabies head coach Joe Schmidt, repeatedly, and so did his replacement scrum-half Tate McDermott and others.And they will be desperate, no question, but how far does desperation get you?Schmidt said his team had desperation written all over their performance in Brisbane, and he meant it as a compliment. He admired their hunger and their refusal to wilt.Farrell said the Wallabies would be a different team in Melbourne. Maybe. Or maybe we're reading too much into the desperation thing. Maybe they're just an Australia team early in their development and out of their depth in games such as this.Media caption, More to come from Lions after opening win - FarrellFor drama and intrigue, we want the series to go to the wire, so we construct an argument around that. The fightback exposed weaknesses in the Lions make-up. Things might have been closer had big calls gone with the Wallabies - a possible yellow card for Tom Curry for taking Tom Lynagh in the air, a possible yellow for Furlong going high on Len Ikitau, a possible yellow for a Ben Earl no-arms tackle on Joseph Suaalii. What might have been…So, the argument goes that the hosts will have confidence going to Melbourne because of the second-half tries and all their possession and territory and near-misses in the try stakes. Will Skelton and Rob Valetini will come back into the side and make them way better. More grist to the mill.A counterpoint is this: they're both class players, but Valetini won't have played in over five weeks by the time Saturday comes around, and Skelton won't have played in six weeks. It should also be remembered the pair of them - plus Langi Gleeson and Noah Lolesio, both injured - all played and lost comprehensively when the Wallabies faced Scotland last November.We can overdo the notion that adding Skelton and Valetini to the mix is going to fundamentally change a team that is sixth in the world - and only sixth because Argentina dropped below them after losing twice to England, and Scotland dropped below them after being beaten by Fiji. They're sixth by default. Realistically, they're eighth in the world.Johnny Sexton was interesting on Friday when asked about the fire and brimstone the Wallabies were expected to produce from the off in Brisbane.The Lions kicking coach said that kind of thing only gets you so far. It might buy you five or 10 minutes but then peters out and there's a game to play. Desperation guarantees nothing.And the Wallaby fury didn't even last 10 seconds at the Suncorp. When Curry nailed James Slipper in the tackle, 10 seconds had been played. When Beirne won the breakdown penalty in its wake, 19 seconds had elapsed. Everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the face - and the Lions flankers' blows landed in clusters.Everybody who believes the series is best served by the Wallabies delivering a bloody nose to the Lions and taking it to a third game will have a quiet support for Schmidt's team.It's more an exercise in wishful thinking than anything else. The optimists from an Australian perspective will look to the final 30 minutes in Brisbane for hope. So let's look at those 30 minutes and ask if the Lions are as likely to be as wasteful and ill-disciplined for a second week in a row.A sloppy Jamison Gibson-Park pass to Finn Russell and a knock-on. Freakish inaccuracy from two majestic operators. A Russell kick charged down, Furlong conceding a penalty, Andrew Porter conceding a penalty, Curry conceding a penalty, an offside penalty, then another, then a forced pass from Jack Conan to Bundee Aki and a spillage, then another Australia penalty.That was all in 15 minutes or so when the Lions were 24-5 ahead. And it continued. Tommy Freeman forces a pass and knocks on, Maro Itoje knocks on, Hugo Keenan misses a tackle on Harry Potter.After all of that, the Lions still had a 15-point advantage, only reduced to eight a couple of minutes from time. The difference between the Lions from minute one to minute 49 and the Lions from minute 50 to minute 80 was stark.If they play for 60 or 70 minutes on Saturday the way they played for 50 in Brisbane they'll win by a street because the Wallabies are undercooked and not particularly good - despite many of us wishing they were good enough to make a proper series of it.And the Lions at their best were very, very good. They were on a different plain, physically and creatively, than the Wallabies. When Dan Sheehan finished off their third try - a thing of real beauty - the temptation was to reach for the record books because it really did feel like an epic shellacking was on its way.Maybe tiredness derailed the Lions. Maybe subconsciously they switched off - an idea floated by Farrell, then shot down by Itoje. The Wallabies grew into it only when the game was already over. The chances of a repeat of such a high error count? Limited.The show has now moved on to Melbourne, where the Lions will play arguably their most meaningless game since 1950, when they went to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to play a side consisting of local businessmen, some armed forces and a cricketer.On Tuesday, the Lions will face First Nations and Pasifika. They've called up a 45th player - Scotland's Gregor Brown. He'll join Ewan Ashman, Rory Sutherland, Darcy Graham, Jamie Osborne and Tom Clarkson as the 'Geography Six' of 2025. All are expected to play a part while the Test squad rest, and while the Wallabies' desperation grows ever higher.More on this story"

It involves camaraderie and friendship, something at the heart of golf. \"Dad's not with us any more but he used to play every Wednesday at Royal Portrush with a group of hackers,\" said Jim's daughter, Zoe. \"They had the best time and they would have a wee regroup at the halfway house and play pretty well on the back nine.\"They eventually all became friends and it was a really eclectic mix of people that Dad brought together, so they decided on his 70th they would chip in and get him a bench.\" Media caption, Watch: Sisters Claire and Zoe share the story behind their dad's bench on the sixth hole of Royal Portrush.Zoe said the secretary of Royal Portrush at the time picked the location on the iconic sixth tee and it was unveiled as a surprise to Jim for his big day.\"She knew the lie of the land and we think she picked the best spot,\"  Zoe added.\"It was a surprise for him and it's been a joy to enjoy it ever since. \"Dad was really excited because he was one of the few people to get a bench while they were still alive. He would often sit on it with his friends and have the craic. \"There have been a lot of stories and family memories from the bench, and now it's been amazing to see so many people from this Open enjoying it.\"Claire, Jim's other daughter, said her father \"would have absolutely loved\" seeing some of the sport's biggest names enjoy his bench at the Open.The sisters added they come and visit the bench every year to reflect on memories of their dad. In Claire's words, \"most people go to a grave - we go to a bench\".\"We were so excited and we know Dad would have got such a kick from it,\" she said while enjoying the Open with Zoe on Saturday.\"He would have loved it if he was still here. \"It's been a bit mad, but we always thought it was the best bench in golf. There was never any dispute around that for us, it's pretty cool.\" The bench is a legacy of friendship - in a way that only a sport like golf can provide - and now others can enjoy a moment of tranquillity, reflection or craic - including some of the sport's biggest names.

Playing for Wales is a massive honour and was a dream of mine.\"I gave myself a year and then it turned into two, but it's just really taken off. To get the contract was Wales was massive. It meant I could do the one thing I love.\"And made the sacrifices worth it, leaving behind friends and family, even partner, behind to follow her Wales course.Image source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Williams was born in Swansea but moved to New Zealand with her family at the age of four.They'll be following her progress from afar when Wales kick-off their tournament against Scotland in Salford on 23 August, having often sent messages from far flung corners of the ocean when Williams has been in action.But with fitness having been an area Lynn was keen to work on during a long, hot summer pre-tournament camp, Williams admits she's already been sharing  messages with her fellow former officers to compare notes\"A few weeks back we were with the Royal Welsh Regiment and, being in the mess at lunchtime, it all felt a case of 'I've been here before!',\" she says.\"I was telling  my mates, imagine if you had to go back to basic training and do it all over again!\"It was tough and – when you're not doing training in a game environment – you never know when it's going to end so you just had to hold on for some of it, keeping looking at the task ahead, getting through it, digging deep inside you.\"Williams admits the sand dunes of Merthyr Mawr were particularly tough – pointing to her red hair for extra sympathy in the sun – mauling up and down hills over and again.\"It was quite funny being in that environment and we took a lot from it as a team,\" she adds. \"It'll benefit us because when we're in some dark moments in a game, you can look to your left, look to your right, and see people who have been through it with you.\"Being able to transfer skills and experiences is something that Williams has been able to do, with Wales now looking to do the same when they face Australia next Saturday (05.00BST) and onto the World Cup.And hopefully put the choppy waters behind them."

But so far in Switzerland, 30-year-old Mead has started just one of England's four games, scoring once in the 6-1 Group D win over Wales.She has adapted to a new role as one of Sarina Wiegman's 'finishers' - a term the squad use to express the importance of the substitutes.\"You've got to be ready to go into the moment,\" Arsenal forward Mead told BBC Sport. \"You've got to be ready to go into a position that you might not want to play or don't normally play in and that was what was different for me [against Sweden]. \"I ended up playing in midfield as a number six and then I was a number 10 - I changed position a few times in the game and I loved it. \"I love being on the pitch. I love being able to do what I can do for the team but they're the things that you have to be able to do as a player. \"You have to expect the unexpected and be willing to do what you need to do for the team and the greater good.\"England's substitutes have played a key role in Switzerland, scoring three goals en route to the semi-finals.Since Euro 2022, England substitutes have scored four result-altering goals - all in knockout games - which is more than any other nation.It is up to Mead, among others, to continue to provide Wiegman with squad depth.\"It's not easy when you know you're not starting and you're playing well or whatever but I think that's what has set us apart as a team,\" she added. \"The togetherness, the willingness to try to make each other better, to try to make each other feel like we can figure it out.\"That's something that I've also seen as a shift of my role. I really know how important that is - from being a starter to being competitive in training - to make us better. So far I think we're doing a good job of that.\""

      "content": "Media caption, 'The genius of modern boxing' - Usyk knocks out Dubois in rematchBobbie JacksonBBC Sport at Wembley StadiumOleksandr Usyk introduced Daniel Dubois and the world to his friend 'Ivan' at Wembley on Saturday.The Ukrainian southpaw landed a flush left hook to seal a fifth-round knockout win and become undisputed heavyweight champion for a second time.Usyk arrived for his post-fight news conference an hour after extending his undefeated record to 24, and after a swift night's work was happy to entertain the packed room.\"My left hook is called Ivan,\" Usyk said. \"Ivan is a Ukrainian name. Ivan is a big guy who lives in a village and works for his family. It's a hard punch, Ivan.\"The first time 2018 [I named it] was in the USA as a cruiserweight.\"Dubois had already climbed off the canvas moments earlier following a right hook to the temple, but it was the sequence that followed with Usyk's favoured left that proved decisive.It was another vintage performance from a master of the craft.A 90,000-strong crowd had been forced to contend with heavy rain at Wembley Stadium earlier in the night, but it was worth persevering to watch the spectacle unfold.Usyk excelled in all areas - escaping Dubois' attacks with slick footwork, returning with crisp shots on the counter and displaying pure heavyweight power.The triumph has propelled Usyk into a very elite category - he joins Muhammad Ali as the only men to reign undisputed in the heavyweight division on two occasions.Usyk is the best of his generationIf it wasn't already clear then it certainly is now. Usyk is the standout heavyweight of his generation.Usyk has not just cleaned out his biggest rivals - Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua and Dubois - but he has gone all the way round the block and defeated each of them twice.He dethroned Joshua in just his third fight as a heavyweight to become a unified champion and it has been an upward trajectory ever since.The easy path is not one Usyk likes to explore.After becoming the first undisputed heavyweight champion of the four-belt era by beating Fury in 2024, Usyk had the option to defend that status by accepting a mandatory defence of his IBF strap against Dubois.However, he elected to vacate that title in order to pursue a rematch with Fury and record a second successive victory, before circling back to reclaim the IBF title from Dubois at Wembley.\"What he achieved today, it was designated by him a little bit more than a year ago,\" Egis Klimas, Usyk's manager, said.\"His decision was to vacate the title and let Dubois beat someone, and then to fight for a third time for undisputed. That was his plan a year ago. He is not just a good boxer but he is good mentally.\"Usyk is head and shoulders above any active heavyweight, with Fury offering his greatest test, while Joshua and Dubois are several rungs down the ladder.Media caption, Usyk nicknames punch that knocked out DuboisMany predicting a win for Dubois on Saturday did so on the basis that Usyk, 11 years the senior of the Briton, must be ready to decline.That obviously isn't the case.But where does this victory - his 15th knockout - leave him in the all-time heavyweight rankings?Usyk has eight heavyweight fights under his belt and six of those have been for world titles.There's an argument that the current era lacks great depth in the heavyweight division when comparing it to the previous century.Through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the likes of Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman dazzled the masses.Going back further, Joe Louis made 25 successful defences between 1937 and 1948.A place in the top three might be something to consider when we have a completed body of work to assess at the point Usyk, who could still have a couple of fights left, finally decides to hang up the gloves.But as an Olympic gold medallist, an undisputed cruiserweight champion and two-time undisputed heavyweight champion, a top-five all-time spot feels right already.\"I think he's a legend,\" former world champion Carl Frampton said on Dazn.\"He can compete in any era. He's beaten everyone and three of the top guys twice.\"Who can stop Usyk?The list of serious contenders for Usyk is short.Queensberry's Frank Warren has seen two of his stable - Fury and Dubois - already go down against Usyk, but he has a third candidate waiting in the wings.Joseph Parker is the interim WBO champion and kept a close eye on Usyk through fight week and on fight night.The New Zealander is on a six-fight win streak and has previously held a world title.At the other end of the scale is bright young Briton Moses Itauma.The 20-year-old is unbeaten in 12 fights as a professional and has been hailed as the future of the division.Itauma has only gone beyond two rounds in two of his bouts, and has 10 knockouts on his CV.But it feels premature to suggest he is ready for the greatest of this era.No-one is yet to formulate a blueprint to even get close to defeating Usyk.Finding a current heavyweight that can match his all-round game has proved impossible and it shows no signs of changing.Media caption, Usyk has fought at heavyweight eight times - and six of those bouts have been for world titles"

UFC, it's your move next, baby, but I'm done talking,\" said Holloway.\"This is Dustin's retirement fight - give it up to my man.\"Former interim lightweight champion Poirier, 36, retires as one of the most respected athletes to step foot inside the octagon.After making his UFC debut in 2011, Poirier won 22 of 32 fights and retires as arguably the best fighter to never win an undisputed title.\"I'm grateful for this experience and journey. I want to thank (UFC president) Dana White and the UFC for giving a kid a platform to make something of his life, to help keep my family is a safe place,\" said an emotional Poirier.\"I'm forever in debt to the company and mixed martial arts. It's taught me everything I know and I'm just thankful I got to walk this walk.\"Holloway beats Poirier at third attemptThe bout concludes the pair's epic rivalry after Poirier's victories in 2012 and 2019.After suffering defeat for the lightweight title in his most recent fight against Islam Makhachev in 2024, Poirier said Holloway would be his final bout.Poirier, accompanied by rapper Lil Wayne, was greeted by a rousing reception in front of his home crowd as he skipped his way towards the octagon.Holloway - as he called for before the fight out of respect to Poirier - was booed on his walkout, before making a fast start when the fight got under way.After mixing up his leg strikes and punches well, Holloway dropped Poirier with a straight right in a confident first round.Holloway remained in control in the second round as he knocked Poirier down again, before the momentum shifted.With seconds of the round remaining, Poirier landed a one-two punch combination which dropped Holloway, before the bell saved him from more damage on the ground.The action continued to go back and forth - Holloway landed longer combinations but Poirier's strikes appeared more damaging - before the crowd rose to their feet in anticipation of the final round.With 10 seconds to go Holloway pointed to the ground in trademark fashion, inviting the pair to stand and trade.Holloway knocked Justin Gaethje out in similar fashion last year and, although he got the better of the exciting exchange, Poirier survived until the final bell.The pair embraced in respect as Holloway kissed Poirier on the forehead before sharing a few words.\"Max is tough to deal with in here. He's slick; he's crafty; he's fast; he's the champ. I got nothing but respect for Max - he's one of the good guys,\" said Poirier.\"I've been chasing my dreams - it's been incredible. I'm a kid living his dream out here, throwing punches, throwing knees. It's incredible.\"Poirier's win over Holloway in 2019 for the interim lightweight belt remains the only UFC championship he won.He lost three undisputed title fights - against Khabib Nurmagomedov, Charles Oliveira and Makhachev - but retires with a glittering resume regardless.He got the better of his trilogy with Conor McGregor - he is the only fighter to knock him out, in 2021 - and has iconic victories over Dan Hooker, Gaethje and Eddie Alvarez.'Truly one of the greatest' - what fighters saidIslam Makhachev on X: , external\"Congratulations, Dustin. You're truly one of the greatest to ever step into the cage. It was an honor and a privilege to share it with you.\"Jorge Masvidal on X:, external \"Congrats on an awesome career Dustin! It's been great sharing this journey with you. Thanks for all the good times and everything you brought to the team. Enjoy retirement, you've more than earned it.\"Jon Jones on X: , external\"I thought Dustin's performance was amazing. He definitely still has it. But it's good to see him walk away just because he wants to. That needs to become normalised in the future.

Stéphan left Rennes for the second time last November and estimates that as well as spending precious time with his two children he watched 20 to 25 games a week as he waited for his next opportunity.

      "content": "Julien Stéphan had been enjoying his break from football for about two months when his wife’s patience finally gave in. “She said to me: ‘I hope you will manage again quickly – and very quickly – because I want to see you on the pitch and to see you back in your own environment,’” says the new Queens Park Rangers manager.Stéphan left Rennes for the second time last November and estimates that as well as spending precious time with his two children he watched 20 to 25 games a week as he waited for his next opportunity. That finally arrived last month when the Frenchman took over at Loftus Road from Martí Cifuentes, who has since joined Leicester. But the chance to take a breather after six years as a manager during which he guided Rennes to the Champions League for the first time and led Strasbourg to sixth in Ligue 1 – their highest position since 1980 – was most welcome.“You need to take time for you and your family,” Stéphan says. “It’s important. But also you need to take time to watch different things, to analyse the game and different games in different leagues and analyse also what you did before and what you want to do after. It’s important to start to imagine how you can see the future.”QPR supporters will be hoping that, after a decade largely marooned in the bottom half of the Championship, the club can bring back some glory days under Stéphan. The 44-year-old has heard the stories about QPR being London’s best team during the first Premier League season, when a side with Les Ferdinand as their star striker finished fifth in 1993. But Stéphan insists they must live in the present to have a chance of escaping what he describes as “probably the most difficult league in the world”.“I know the history of QPR, but now we are in a different period,” he says. “It’s important to remember and to know the history, but it’s also important to live in the present and to build for the future. There is work to do with everybody, with the players, of course, with the management, with the CEO, with the owners, and also with the legends of the club. It’s the responsibility of everybody.”Julien Stéphan with Steve Cook in a pre-season match against Stevenage. ‘It’s important to live in the present and build for the future,’ he says. Photograph: Andrew Fosker/ShutterstockStéphan adds: “We know the expectations from the fans – we need to give everything on the pitch, and we need also to create a strong identity. It’s very important, and after that it’s football. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but you need to give everything.”Stéphan has been so busy since being appointed that he has not had time to move into his new flat near QPR’s home ground, let alone explore Shepherd’s Bush and the surrounding area. “Only work, work, work and work,” he says. “Just hotel and training ground and training sessions …”Stéphan is speaking from a pre-season camp in Girona that has allowed him and his staff, who include the former West Ham, Charlton and France midfielder Alou Diarra as an assistant, to get to know their players before their gruelling Championship season kicks off on 9 August. “It’s the beginning of the process and we need to build step by step all the ideas, the collective ideas and also the relationship between the players and the staff,” he says.Stéphan spent time as a player in Paris Saint-Germain’s academy but never made a top-flight appearance for his various clubs before he retired at 27 to concentrate on coaching. By then he had taken charge of Rennes’ under-19s for three years and been to university to study Staps (Sciences et Techniques des Activités Physiques et Sportives), the route usually taken by French people who want to become sports teachers.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionJulien Stéphan celebrates a goal with his Rennes team against PSG in 2019. Photograph: Jean-François Monier/AFP/Getty Images“I just wanted to learn something that could help me with the ideas that I had about development,” says Stéphan, whose father, Guy Stéphan, was assistant to Didier Deschamps for France’s World Cup triumph in 2018 and has managed Senegal. “I didn’t choose this job at the beginning to do the same thing as my father but because I wanted to work with young players. And to be honest, at the beginning, I thought that I could do that all my career with the young players. And it was just after 12 or 15 years that I imagined the future differently. Of course, we speak together and he can give me some advice sometimes, but I also need to live my own experience.”The Rennes academy’s fabled production line in recent years includes Ousmane Dembélé, Eduardo Camavinga, Jérémy Doku and Desiré Doué – all of whom played under Stéphan, either for the youth sides or the first team, with whom he had two spells as manager, initially as an interim in 2018. He led Rennes to their first trophy for almost 50 years when they beat PSG in the French Cup final a few months later. He knows QPR will find it hard to replicate that kind of production line given that they are competing with so many London clubs for the best talent, but Stéphan thinks there is one advantage they may have.“A strong point that we can say to families [of young players] is that it’s probably easier at 18 or 19 years old to play in the Championship than in the Premier League,” he says. “And the development of the player can also pass this way. So, yes, play in the Championship. After that, for the best of them, perhaps play in the Premier League. So we can develop this kind of thinking with the family.“But it’s difficult to compare the young players of the academy at QPR with these kinds of players: Ousmane Dembélé, Eduardo Camavinga, Desiré Doué. They’re top, top, top, top, top players. Most important is to create the opportunity for the best of them in the academy to have the possibility to train with the professionals and for the best of them also to play in the first team.”"

My opponent was very tough. It was a wonderful fight.\"Asked if he wants a rematch, he said: \"Yes, of course.\"Pacquiao became the oldest fighter to win the welterweight title when he did so at the age of 40 in 2019.No fighter has won a major world title after being inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame - Pacquiao was given the honour in June 2025.'He's still strong as hell'That Pacquiao lasted the distance was a triumph in itself. In the early rounds he displayed speed and agility that belied his years, putting together vintage combinations.After a two-month training camp, Pacquiao appeared in better shape than in 2021, when he lost to Yordenis Ugas in his last fight.Pacquiao landed 101 of his 577 punches (17.5%) compared to Barrios' 120 from 658 (18.2%). Pacquiao landed 81 power punches to Barrios' 75.Barrios' age advantage started to tell as the fight wore on, with Pacquiao slowing down towards the end.Pacquiao, who failed to win re-election as a senator in the Philippines government in May, was granted a title shot because of the WBC's rules on former champions coming out of retirement.He spent two months in a training camp before the fight. \"His stamina is crazy,\" Barrios said.\"He's still strong as hell and his timing is real. He's still a very awkward fighter to try to figure out.\"Mayweather rematch? Though Barrios said he would \"love\" to fight Pacquiao again, the Filipino's next opponent is unclear.Sean Gibbons, Pacquiao's manager, told reporters after the fight that the 46-year-old \"deserved\" to fight a bigger name than Barrios in his next bout.\"He's a nice guy [Barrios] and I like the kid, but Manny deserves a bigger name,\" said Gibbons.\"There are fighters like Gervonta 'Tank' Davis and [Rolando] 'Rolly' Romero out there.\"Romero, the WBA regular welterweight champion, is yet to finalise his next opponent after beating Ryan Garcia in May, while Davis fights in the lightweight division. But Pacquiao, who wants to fight again before the end of the year, is not ruling out a rematch against former rival Floyd Mayweather.\"If Mayweather comes out of retirement and signs the contract, we'll fight,\" Pacquiao said. \"Let's fight again if he wants. I'm active now.\"The Filipino accused Mayweather of \"ducking\" the fight earlier this week, suggesting the American only wanted an exhibition bout.Should the pair fight again, it would be a repeat of the 2015 clash that saw Mayweather win via unanimous decision to unify the WBC, WBA and WBO welterweight titles.

      "image": "https://example.com/default-news.jpg",
      "category": "basketball",
      "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- It's a good time to be Napheesa Collier. It's also demanding and exhausting. Collier, who was named MVP of the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game on Saturday night after scoring a record-setting 36 points and grabbing nine rebounds, is the face of two leagues, one of which she co-founded. She has also emerged as a leading voice for the Women's National Basketball Players Association in their historic labor battle with the league. \"She has balls,\" fellow All-Star and Minnesota Lynx teammate Courtney Williams said. \"Seeing the things that -- to play basketball and then to have constant meetings and interviews, the girl is just, man, to see it inspires me. I be like, 'Damn, she be getting it in for real.'\"What is quickly turning into the Year of Phee began back in January when Unrivaled, the 3-on-3 league she co-founded with New York Liberty star Breanna Stewart tipped off its inaugural season. Over the course of two months, Unrivaled offered WNBA players an opportunity to train and play against elite competition during the offseason without having to go overseas.  The league also paid players an average salary of $222,000, which exceeds the WNBA's regular max salary for the 2025 season. \n        \n\n\n\"Women's sports is on such a rise, and it feels like everyone is benefiting from that except the women in the sport, and obviously that's something we're trying to change and then also create generational wealth for these women,\" Collier told CBS Sports' \"We Need to Talk\" last year. \"From the beginning, [Stewart] and I really set out to create a league that was founded on that principle that players deserve compensation and ownership that reflect their value.\"Collier has applied those same principles in her role as a vice president of the WNBPA. As a member of the union's executive committee, Collier has long been at the forefront of the behind-the-scenes negotiations with the league on a new collective bargaining agreement. Over All-Star Weekend, she became one of the most prominent public voices in that battle. WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike called Collier's leadership \"fantastic\" after the All-Star Game. The players are what is building this brand and this league,\" Collier said at the podium with her MVP trophy by her side. \"There is no league without the players, and the past, present, the new ones coming up, they're the ones that have put in the blood, sweat and tears for the new money that's coming in. We feel like we are owed a piece of that pie that to create.\" \n        \n\nIn October 2024, the WNBPA opted out of the current CBA, which will expire at the end of this season. Since then, little progress has been made on a new CBA. The league and the WNBPA met in person this weekend for the first time since December, but the talks only served to frustrate the players. Upon announcing their intention to opt out, the players stated that they were seeking \"transformational change.\" Their two biggest demands are higher salaries and an increased share of revenue, and they are \"holding firm\" on those issues, Collier told reporters Friday. Earlier this month, the WNBA announced three new expansion teams -- Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia -- which will bring the league to 18 teams by 2030. Those three franchises paid record-setting $250 million expansion fees. Starting next year, a new $2.2 billion media rights deal will begin. \n        \n\nCollier and Co. want their cut, as they re-emphasized by wearing special warm-up shirts prior to the All-Star Game that read \"Pay us what you owe us.\" Thanks in large part to Collier's leadership, the players have been a united front throughout this process. Over 40 of them attended the CBA meetings this weekend, the highest rate of participation in league history, which Collier called a \"really strong message.\" \n        \n            \n                \n                WNBA All-Star Game 2025: Caitlin Clark, other stars wear 'Pay us what you owe us' shirts amid CBA negotiations\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    \n                        \n                \n                    \n    \n\"She's a natural leader,\" Williams said. \"She represents all of us in a way in which I know that I'm 100% OK with her speaking for me.\" Collier has not let her off-court responsibilities impact her on-court production. If anything, she's been better than ever. \n        \n\nDuring Unrivaled, Collier was by far the best player. She put up absurd stat lines on a nightly basis and averaged 25.7 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.8 assists, two steals and 1.4 blocks on 61.3% shooting en route to MVP honors. Her Lunar Owls went 13-1 in the regular season, but were eliminated in the semifinals despite a 36-point effort from Collier. Collier's exploits in Miami, where the entire Unrivaled season was played, helped reinforce her status as an MVP favorite heading into the 2025 WNBA season. During an opening night win over the Dallas Wings, Collier went for 34 points, four rebounds and four assists, and has never looked back. At the All-Star break she's averaging a career-high 23.2 points, 7.6 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.6 blocks. She's first in the league in scoring, eighth in rebounding, fourth in steals and fourth in blocks. \nWith Collier leading the way, the Lynx got off to a 9-0 start and are 20-4 at the break. No other team has more than 15 wins. After losing the 2024 Finals in heartbreaking fashion, the Lynx have been the best team this season and are the current favorites to win it all. \n        \n\nCollier has spent the last seven months bouncing between boardrooms and basketball courts. Along the way she's stacked a number of wins and lifted multiple trophies. More of each should be on the way, and at least one appears to already be in the bag. The odds say so (-650, per Caesars), and so does Williams, who only had one word to say when asked if Collier would take home the 2025 WNBA MVP award: \"Duh.\"A new CBA and a 2025 WNBA championship aren't guarantees, but come October it could be an even better time to be Napheesa Collier."

The legendary fighter walked away from the ring on Saturday without a win ... or a loss. Pacquiao, 46, fought hard to a majority draw with WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in the main event of a PBC on Prime PPV from Las Vegas.The draw means that Barrios still holds on to the title and that Pacquiao will have to try again to make even more history in the ring. Pacquiao was attempting to become the first fighter to ever win a world title in four different decades. His first fight since 2021 proved to be OK from an overall standpoint. Pacquiao was never seriously hurt or in trouble, but his age has certainly slowed him down a bit and it will be interesting to see just where he goes from here despite saying afterwards that he wants to continue to fight.Elsewhere on the card, Sebastian Fundora proved why he was worthy of his WBC junior middleweight title by scoring a stoppage of Tim Tszyu in their rematch. Fundora originally won the title in a split decision over Tszyu in March 2024, and despite that fight being consider a Fight of the Year contender, many wondered whether a cut opened on Tszyu's head by an accidental elbow affected the fight. Fundora left no doubt this time around by battering Tszyu, including a knockdown in Round 1. Tszyu's corner called off the fight after Round 7 with their fighter badly beaten. \n        \n\nCBS Sports was with you throughout fight week with the latest news, in-depth features and betting advice to consider.

Poirier couldn't quite cap off the final moment with a win, however, because former featherweight champion Max Holloway proved to be just too much to handle. Poirier and Holloway authored another epic chapter in their friendly rivalry as the two met for the third time in New Orleans on Saturday. Holloway dropped Poirier twice early, but Poirier did manage to rebound and give himself some life. But in the end, the Hawaiian was able to weather the storm and hostile crowd to walk away victorious as Poirier laid down his gloves for the final time.Elsewhere on the card, Paulo Costa put a jolt into his career with an emphatic decision win over rising contender Roman Kopylov. Costa, who entered the fight just 1-4 since 2020, dropped Kopylov early and never relented on the pressure. The key win can keep him relevant in a rather shallow 185-pound division. Plus, Daniel Rodriguez scored a stunning upset of Kevin Holland after scoring a pair of knockdowns. And former Bellator MMA two-division champion Patricio Pitbull earned his first UFC win by beating Dan Ige by decision.\n        \n\nCBS Sports was with you throughout fight week with the latest news, in-depth features and betting advice to consider.

She saved Amel Majri's opening spot-kick to put Germany ahead, scored a penalty herself, then made sure Sara Dabritz's miss was not costly by pulling off a diving save to keep Alice Sombath out.\"I am not really an emotional person,\" Berger said when asked to reflect on her journey from cancer diagnosis to this moment.\"The time here just makes me proud to be here. Whatever happened in 2022 is in the past, I'm looking forward to the future and now I live my best life and I am in a semi-final.\"Even playing at a European Championship has been a long time coming for Berger, who is engaged to England defender Jess Carter.Aged 34 years 269 days, she became Germany's oldest player to appear at the Euros when making her competition debut in their opening game against Poland.Media caption, 'What a night!' - Germany through to semi-finalsBerger was was first diagnosed with cancer in 2017 while playing for Birmingham City, but she returned to football 76 days later and went on to be named in the Professional Footballers' Association team of the year.She then enjoyed an extremely successful spell at Chelsea, winning five Women's Super League titles before moving to US side Gotham FC last year.\"She is a player who has had extreme experiences,\" Wuck said after the game.\"That is a very important character trait. I think her faith and pathway in life has made sure she is patient, and the patience and calmness she brings to the team she proved today.\"Berger, who was named player of the match, said reporters should not focus on her performance.\"All the credit should go to the team and not me. Maybe it was the decisive moment in penalty shootout, but everyone here should talk about the performance of the team because that was amazing and incredible,\" she  said.Germany midfielder Sjoeke Nusken said she was always confident they would win on penalties, knowing Berger was between the posts.\"I knew we had Ann-Katrin Berger, so we are very good in this,\" she said.\"She is an amazing goalkeeper. She is so calm, she is so clever and I knew she would save penalties. We are very happy she is in our team.\"Germany's victory was the second quarter-final to be decided by penalties after England beat Sweden in a shootout that lacked quality compared to Germany and France's display.\"This is two outstanding performances from goalkeepers that we have seen most recently,\" said former England keeper Karen Bardsley.\"Hannah Hampton won player of the match against Sweden. Through a slightly biased lens, I am so pleased to see goalkeepers get the credit they deserve.\"I'm not German but I would be so proud to support these girls with the way they played this game out in such difficult circumstances.\"This is a real players' performance tonight. I've been really impressed; Germany showed some real grit.\""

(The Guardian scored it 115-113 for Pacquiao.)“I thought I won the fight,” Pacquiao said afterward. “It was a close fight. My opponent was very tough. It was a wonderful fight.”The result was met with lusty boos from a pro-Pacquiao crowd of 13,107 inside the MGM Grand Garden Arena, which had spent much of the evening roaring their support for the 46-year-old from the Philippines. And for much of the bout, it looked like they were about to witness boxing’s only eight-division world champion make history yet again.Mario Barrios, left, fights Manny Pacquiao on Saturday in Las Vegas. Photograph: John Locher/APFrom the opening round Pacquiao fought with surprising urgency, using angles and volume punching and his signature hand speed to offset Barrios’ height, youth and four-inch reach advantage. He won the first frame behind a flurry of jabs and straight lefts, sparking loud cheers with every landed punch.Though Barrios began to find a home for his jab and counter right hands in the second, Pacquiao resumed control in the third with a sharper rhythm and faster hands, dictating the pace of the action. He buzzed Barrios in the sixth with a snapping left hand, then again moments later with another lead shot that caught the champion square. “His stamina, he could still crack,” Barrios said. “He’s still strong as hell. His timing, his rhythm, everything. He was still a very awkward fighter to try to figure out.”Pacquiao’s performance, particularly in rounds six through nine, had the feeling of a time warp. He zipped in and out of range with fluid footwork and mixed in combination like a man half his age. By the end of the 10th, Pacquiao appeared to be well ahead on the scorecards. Even Barrios seemed to acknowledge he had to dig deep to close the gap. “Not necessarily that it was getting away from me,” Barrios said. “I just knew I had to try to step it up to really solidify a win.”To his credit, Barrios did just that. He clearly won the 11th, landing his best combination of the night and forcing Pacquiao into a rare sequence of retreat. In the 12th, he kept the tempo high, trading shots and finishing strong – just enough to sweep the final three rounds on all three official cards and retain the WBC’s version of the title at 147lb. “I thought I still pulled it out,” Barrios said. “But I still tip my hat to Manny. It was an absolute honor to share the ring with him, somebody with so much experience who has accomplished so much in this sport. We left everything in the ring. Nothing but love and respect.”The fight marked Pacquiao’s first since his unanimous-decision loss to Yordenis Ugás in 2021. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame last month, and few expected him to compete again at this level, much less push a reigning titleholder to the brink. “I’m more experienced,” Pacquiao said. “I’m a more tactical fighter than before. I’m not as careless as I was when I was young. Now I’m more careful.”Mario Barrios, right, lands a shot to Manny Pacquiao’s body on Saturday night. Photograph: Harry How/Getty ImagesThat maturity showed in his measured footwork, selective bursts and veteran nous, including moments where he appeared to be refereeing the fight himself. But even Pacquiao admitted his comeback camp had been rushed. “I only had two months training,” he said. “What I need to do is continue my training. In a championship fight like this, I should train four months, [or at least] three months and a half. But because of the election in the Philippines, I started late. But it’s OK. I love the Filipino people, and I love to give honor to my country.”Pacquiao, whose professional record now stands at 62–9–3 with 39 knockouts, said he would “absolutely” consider fighting again and made it clear he wants a rematch. “Yes, of course,” he said. “That’s the only legacy that I can leave behind. To give inspiration to the Filipino people and to be proud wherever you are.”Barrios, whose ledger moves to 29–2–2 after a second straight draw, seemed open to the idea. “Absolutely. This was huge for boxing,” he said. “What me and him were able to bring here today, I would love to do it again.”Four decades on from his professional debut, Pacquiao once again proved that age is just a number and that greatness, even in a draw, still carries the power to inspire. “It’s an inspiration to old boxers,” Pacquiao said. “If you have discipline and hard work, you can still fight. I’m so thankful to God, because without God, Manny Pacquiao is not here. God is the source of all the strength and good health that I have right now.”"

      "content": "<p>Sebastian Fundora won his first match against Tim Tszyu, but an inadvertant elbow caused a bad cut that affected Tszyu throughout the bout. On Saturday, there was no fluke cut, just a dominant showing by WBC junior middleweight champion Fundora before Tszyu retired in his corner as the co-main event of the Manny Pacquiao vs. Mario Barrios PPV event in Las Vegas on Saturday.It took little time for Fundora to send a message to Tszyu, landing a thudding left in the first round that dropped Tszyu to the canvas. Tszyu beat the count, but it took several rounds before it appeared he'd shaken off the knockdown and was fully back in the fight.Fundora, the tallest champion in boxing despite fighting at just 154 pounds, used his reach brillaintly throughout the fight, peppering Tszyu with jabs as well as straight left hands that seemed as though they could not miss.Tszyu eventually fought his way back into the fight, having good success with heavy left hooks and overhand rights in rounds six and seven. Even as Tszyu began to find more success, he was being tagged with a steady stream of punches from the champion.After the seventh round, a round that may have been Tszyu's best of the fight, the referee checked on Tszyu in the corner and was told Tszyu had nothing left.</p>\n\n<p>\"He's one tough motherf---er,\" Tszyu said of his decision to stop the fight. \"I tried to give it everything, but I just couldn't do it. The victory belongs to Sebastian Fundora, the best 154-pounder on the planet today. He was just the better man. ... He's the better man. He's very hard to land. He's tall as f--- and sometimes I felt I was shadowboxing myself, but it is what it is.\"Fundora showed a mature approach to the fight after spending much of his early career exchanging shots in toe-to-toe battles despite his ridiculous height advantage.After the fight, Fundora said that he realized he is not going to grow anymore, saying, \"I'm not drinking any more milk.\" Knowing that, he decided it was time to embrace his physical advantages.</p>\n\n<p>\"I felt like I'm obviously the better guy,\" Fundora said. \"Everyone is telling me I'm a bully in the ring, and I thought let's just bully these guys. ... I looked at myself in the mirror this morning and thought, 'Oh wow, I have reach.'\"</p>"

Paul, the 20-year veteran, is a free agent. The Clippers want to add more playmaking and ballhandling, and the franchise's former quarterback from the Lob City era and all-time assists leader is a possibility.</p><p>\"What I'd say about Chris is he's a great player,\" Frank said when asked if the Clippers will sign Paul next. \"He's a great Clipper. He obviously possesses some of the qualities we [are looking for].

Harden played a role in helping recruit Beal to the Clippers, even spending 30 minutes on the phone with Bartelstein, according to Frank.</p><p>Beal averaged 17 points and shot 38.6% from 3 in 53 games last season for the Suns. It was the fewest points Beal has averaged in a season since 2014-15. Beal saw his status as a full-time starter change as the guard came off the bench in 15 games, the first time he was a reserve since the 2015-16 season.</p><p>But the Clippers believe they will be a better fit for Beal. They will be getting a 32-year-old guard who has averaged 21.5 points, 4.3 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 37.6% from behind the arc for his career.</p><p>Beal not only will start at shooting guard but is also expected to help fill the shooting and scoring void left by <a data-player-guid=\"4941d040-1812-cbb0-27bf-598cd624bc84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2595516/norman-powell\">Norman Powell</a>, who was traded to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"81e3212c-30ef-9b1b-5edb-453b13ff265a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a> in the deal that helped the Clippers land Collins.</p><p>Beal's shooting and scoring is an ideal fit alongside Harden and <a data-player-guid=\"87ff907c-c68c-a82d-1215-37e05d0c62ef\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a>, and he can help take the ballhandling and distributing burden off the former.</p><p>\"Not to take any sort of slight at Phoenix, but playing with James is a whole lot different than what their situation was,\" Frank said. \"Obviously, Brad had great success playing with John Wall [in Washington]. He actually had great success playing with Russ [Westbrook in Washington]. So, we can look at those situations.</p><p>\"I think some of the areas that, especially in his Washington days, that he was able to explore with not the same level of talent [there], I think we'll be able to get a little bit more out of [here].

To his right, more fans pushed against the ropes just to try and get a little closer. As he waited to hit, McIlroy allowed himself a smile. The chants soon began.</p><p>\"Rory! Rory! Rory!\"</p><p>They had been going on all day -- loud as he made birdie on the opening hole, louder still when he tapped in for another birdie on 2 and as loud as they had been all week when he hit his approach shot on the par-4 fourth and started 3-under through four. Eight holes later, on the 12th, the noise reached a climax. McIlroy's 56-foot eagle putt tipped into the bottom of the hole. A fist pump. A roar. This was the moment they had all been waiting for.</p><p>\"The roar when this ball was in was insane. It was insane all day, but the noise after that putt went in was incredible,\" McIlroy said. \"That was a really cool moment ... could be one of the coolest moments I've ever had on a golf course.\"</p><p>All day, the thousands of fans -- be it from Northern Ireland or beyond -- seemed to carry McIlroy from hole to hole. Birdie or bogey, the noise was there, crescendoing as he reached every green.</p><p>At every turn, through the dunes and the crosswalks, at every crowded hill and gathering spot, the crowd was a reminder that McIlroy was, and has been, the main event this week. Outside of the hotel next to the fourth fairway, a group of workers all stood in a single file line to watch McIlroy come through. Next to the green on the fifth, fans made the climb from the nearby beach to the top of a dune that allowed them to get a glimpse of the action.</p><p>Once McIlroy was able to hit off that 17th tee, his shot found the right gallery. One fan picked up his ball -- anything to feel closer to their hometown hero. While standing in a swarm of his followers, McIlroy replaced it, lined up the tough approach shot over a greenside bunker and landed it safely on the green. He walked forward and the crowd that had split like the Red Sea to let him in re-formed behind him, getting louder by the second.</p><p>\"Rory! Rory! Rory!\"</p><p>At various points throughout Saturday, the dream of a homecoming win to them, and to McIlroy, felt alive. And yet, in between moments of madness, the sport's most inevitable force loomed in the silence.</p><p>Enter <a data-player-guid=\"38cbeebe-aac8-fb36-dce0-cf45436086e4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9478/scottie-scheffler\">Scottie Scheffler</a>.</p><p>The 17th green and the 13th green at Royal Portrush are connected and, as McIlroy stalked his birdie putt, Scheffler stood on top of the opposite hill. Scheffler's tee shot landed -- where else? -- pin high. McIlroy had been stealing glimpses at scoreboards throughout the day to see where he stood. This time, the harsh reality of what he was going up against was staring right back at him.</p><p>\"Scottie Scheffler is -- it's inevitable,\" McIlroy said. \"Even when he doesn't have his best stuff. He's just so solid. He doesn't make mistakes.\"</p><p>Scheffler made par on 13 and added another birdie on Calamity Corner, the tough, long, par-3 16th hole that has given players fits all week. Not Scheffler. He has birdied it all three days.</p><p>\"There doesn't seem to be any weakness there,\" McIlroy said. \"Whenever you're trying to chase down a guy like that, it's hard to do.\"</p><p>It's not just McIlroy's dream that Scheffler is foiling. Matthew Fitzpatrick is five shots back heading into Sunday. He was only one shot back to start the day. <a data-player-guid=\"4c308ece-76d6-b5d7-697c-7d1d3535f1d0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5409/russell-henley\">Russell Henley</a> shot 65 on Saturday and <a data-player-guid=\"e23e62a8-8995-6b06-42f2-018c8a27e916\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10140/xander-schauffele\">Xander Schauffele</a> shot 66.

It's impressive to watch, and what he's doing is incredible.\"</p><p>Even <a data-player-guid=\"f407b075-96bc-e0d7-7e69-6eef7abf0c48\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9221/haotong-li\">Haotong Li</a>, who did not fade and shot a round of 69 that put him four shots back of Scheffler and in Sunday's final group, couldn't help but acknowledge his standing.</p><p>\"Four shots behind, kind of like play for second,\" Li said. \"Especially play[ing] with world No. 1.\"</p><p>There's something almost unnerving about the way that, as players can't help but recognize Scheffler's exceptional performances, Scheffler himself will downplay them at every step. Even when presented with an objective example of his own greatness -- the fact that he has closed out nine straight 54-hole leads -- Scheffler shrugs.</p><p>\"Your guess is as good as mine,\" Scheffler said to the question of why he has been such an effective closer. \"I like being out here competing.\"</p><p>Even as he bemoans the fickle nature of winning like he did earlier this week, Scheffler's obsession with competing -- whether he likes it or not -- has brought him to a place where he is being chased by everyone while he is chasing history, the ghosts of golf's past and a <a data-player-guid=\"b967ea91-ed2c-fad0-cf10-ba1dda3f869e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/462/tiger-woods\">Tiger Woods</a> comparison that continues to gain, not lose, steam. With a victory Sunday, Scheffler will be the fourth player to win The Open, the Masters and the PGA Championship before their 30th birthday. The last to do that was Woods.</p><p>McIlroy and everyone else behind him have to believe they control their destinies on Sunday. But in reality, their hopes hinge on the performance of a guy who vanquishes dreams for a living.</p>\n</div></div>"
