The club's owners might regard the Club World Cup as the pinnacle, enabling Chelsea to project themselves as world champions until the next planned staging of the tournament in 2029, and Maresca was keen to talk up the importance of the win.</p><p>\"I think it will become as important as the Champions League,\" the coach said after the game. \"And we value it as much as winning the Champions League.\"</p><p>The reality for Chelsea's supporters, though, is that the Premier League is really what matters. Ask any Premier League supporter and being able to assert themselves as champions of England is the first priority.</p><p>But the good news for Chelsea is that their victory over PSG -- a deserved win against the best team in the world over the past six months -- highlighted the potential of Maresca and his team.</p><p>After three years of throwing money around and having a revolving door of players heading in and out of the locker room, Chelsea finally look to have built a team. The summer addition of Pedro from <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"78c91a3f-9e5e-c8fe-8fca-778e97cb021a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=331\">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a> might prove to be the decisive signing -- the player who makes it all fit together -- but many of the building blocks were already in place. They just needed time and patience before gelling.</p><p>Maresca also has silenced his doubters during the Club World Cup, showing himself to be tactically astute and prepared to change his approach when the occasion demands. By moving full-back <a data-player-guid=\"b89d5b36-af9b-ee96-1d95-3dcb40636b86\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/189007/reece-james\">Reece James</a> into midfield alongside Caicedo and <a data-player-guid=\"b6765ac7-63b2-227c-12e8-f6342bf9405c\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/285450/enzo-fernandez\">Enzo Fernández</a> to cope with PSG's midfield of <a data-player-guid=\"025e47e3-91a4-3a04-bd98-66fca18c9a04\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/403234/vitinha\">Vitinha</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"3f4da3cb-c4c3-3421-91ee-b8defa5f7f53\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/355061/joao-neves\">João Neves</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"70c7088d-af91-f008-6fde-27addeb58a13\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/214596/fabian-ruiz\">Fabián Ruiz</a>, Maresca made the key move to win the game.</p><p>Prior to the final, Maresca had said that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45718366/chelsea-psg-fifa-club-world-cup-final-upset-chess-match\" target=\"_blank\">he regarded football as being like chess</a> in that you had to outthink and outsmart your opponent. He did just that against Luis Enrique, a coach who has won trebles with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"58f7c4a9-c991-4ed4-fe5c-1f833cba75b8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> and PSG. If Maresca can outfox Enrique, he can do it against anybody.</p><p>But winning a Premier League takes more than winning tactical battles against rival coaches. The players must deliver too and take responsibility on the pitch.</p><p>Palmer, of course, is the ace in Chelsea's pack. He has won games single-handedly in the past, but the way did it against PSG was mesmerizing, scoring two goals before creating a third for Pedro. Palmer floats with intent across the front three but is most dangerous playing on the right then cutting inside, as he did to such devastating effect against the <a data-league-guid=\"b7217910-7773-3ea8-bc69-30c19c579306\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FRA.1\">Ligue 1</a> champions. The England forward is a proven performer in the Premier League and good enough to be Chelsea's version of <a data-player-guid=\"49438d5e-de32-9f1b-9aab-5f6ae53f14d0\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/173896/mohamed-salah\">Mohamed Salah</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"c2bc0ee8-46fa-2189-ca21-014bc1c0e7e2\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/134947/kevin-de-bruyne\">Kevin De Bruyne</a> by winning the biggest games for his team.</p><p>And he also seems to have struck an instant understanding with Pedro, who has shown himself to be a major upgrade on the inconsistent <a data-player-guid=\"ed90b32c-f09c-302e-af63-852a1e2a9352\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/308524/nicolas-jackson\">Nicolas Jackson</a>. Yet when Pedro was replaced by <a data-player-guid=\"0406d93b-ba27-3365-9c3b-5aba080308c6\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/307114/liam-delap\">Liam Delap</a> during the second half against PSG, the summer signing from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/373/ipswich-town\" target=\"_blank\">Ipswich Town</a> also had a big impact and looked sharp and dangerous.</p><p>So, Chelsea can call on a number of real goal threats; they have an intelligent, pragmatic coach; and their midfield is tenacious and effective. Perhaps they still have issues to address in defence, but against PSG, Maresca's back four and goalkeeper <a data-player-guid=\"0e0f3d6b-8e88-dc88-650c-b4592e9cc766\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/108662/robert-sanchez\">Robert Sánchez</a> demonstrated they can keep it tight and concentrate for 90 minutes.</p><p>All in all, Chelsea have every ingredient required to win the Premier League, and their success in the United States will no doubt have been noted back home by <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a47fbcec-c948-cf4c-9e41-3dfa37588c9c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=364\">Liverpool</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"feb44e87-58fa-9597-2691-b3c32768ebe4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=359\">Arsenal</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a>.</p><p>If they can find consistency, Chelsea are back in the race for the Premier League title.</p>\n</div></div>"

The Mariners subsequently agreed to an $8.8 million signing bonus with Anderson, about $700,000 less than the slot value for the No. 3 pick, a source told ESPN, confirming a report by MLB.com.</p><p>The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f3f1ba71-05f1-a49a-0363-3b1d8e0db4cf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies\">Colorado Rockies</a> followed by taking Holliday, the son of one of the best players in their franchise's history, at No. 4.</p><p>The first round of the draft was held at a small concert venue adjacent to Truist Park, site of Monday's Home Run Derby and Tuesday's All-Star Game. Fans filled the place, but no draftees were present -- a function, largely, of some of the major agencies advising their clients not to attend, at the risk of surrendering leverage.</p><p>Tennessee left-hander Liam Doyle went to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a> at No. 5; right-hander Seth Hernandez, the Gatorade National Player of the Year while starring for Corona High School in California, went to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> at No. 6; and Oregon State shortstop Aiva Arquette went to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"74909d10-eacb-1376-ef1e-d0f37d7c67ca\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins\">Miami Marlins</a> at No. 7. The next three picks were high school shortstops, highlighting a major strength of this draft: JoJo Parker (eighth to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0151aed9-9f11-ceae-195d-180ca603b64a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a>), Steele Hall (ninth to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"04b65a0b-3cca-d795-0e21-23606470418a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-reds\">Cincinnati Reds</a>) and Billy Carlson (10th to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8f4800c6-3c05-b3d5-8186-9750cd72a3c2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a>).</p><p>Willits, who doesn't turn 18 until Dec. 9, led Fort Cobb-Broxton High School in Oklahoma to its third straight state title this past season and had previously committed to Oklahoma. A 6-foot-1 switch-hitter, Willits is hailed for his bat-to-ball skills and plate discipline and is considered a strong defensive shortstop. At 17 years and 216 days old, he is the youngest player taken No. 1 since the Mariners took Ken Griffey Jr. in 1987.</p><p>\"He makes the routine plays about as easy as anybody you can see, much less a 17-year-old,\" Nationals vice president of amateur scouting Danny Haas said.</p><p>Willits is the son of ex-big leaguer Reggie Willits, who played six seasons with the Angels and also coached with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2b9cedf3-ce60-0bcf-fafe-8cd055255685\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a>.</p><p>It was only a week ago that the Nationals fired general manager Mike Rizzo, who was in his 17th year atop baseball operations and had a big hand in selecting Stephen Strasburg and <a data-player-guid=\"a3630ca2-c9aa-7ff0-2a19-2d714c80b459\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30951/bryce-harper\">Bryce Harper</a> the other times the team drafted No. 1 overall -- in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Nationals manager Davey Martinez was also fired last week.</p><p>Willits has drawn comparisons to current Yankees shortstop <a data-player-guid=\"9a98f8e9-c371-32a1-ac9d-040b12582b8d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42547/anthony-volpe\">Anthony Volpe</a>. He won't hit for a lot of power, but he has the potential to routinely hit 20 home runs and steal 20 bases at a premium position. Slot value for the No. 1 pick is a record $11,075,900 this year.</p><p>\"I feel like I have good hittability and I'm going to take that to the next level,\" Willits said when asked about his strengths. \"And I feel like my power is up-and-coming, but I needed to get into an organization like the Nationals that can help develop that and take that to the next level.\"</p><p>Bremner sits at 93 to 96 mph with his fastball, while also boasting a changeup and slider. He posted a 3.49 ERA with a Big West-leading 111 strikeouts in 77⅓ innings this season. ESPN's Kiley McDaniel ranked him as the 18th-best prospect heading into the draft, behind six other pitchers, but other teams considered taking him much earlier in the draft. His selection came a month after his mother died of breast cancer.</p><p>\"I know she's out there watching, and in a weird way, I went to the Angels,\" Bremner said. \"It's weird how life works, so, it's a special moment.\"</p><p>Anderson was named Most Outstanding Player at this year's College World Series, winning both of his starts and posting a 0.56 ERA while leading the LSU Tigers to their second championship in three years. Prior to that, he led Division I with 180 strikeouts and 119 innings and was a Golden Spikes Award semifinalist, following in the success of former LSU star and 2023 No. 1 pick <a data-player-guid=\"cdfd69c1-1b9b-30fe-acf4-aad457b0850e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719507/paul-skenes\">Paul Skenes</a>.</p><p>Holliday, the Oklahoma Gatorade Player of the Year, batted .611 with 19 homers, a 1.295 slugging percentage and a 2.038 OPS in his senior year at Stillwater High School in Oklahoma.</p><p>Holliday projects to play either shortstop or third base, and he'll be doing it for the same organization that drafted his father, Matt, in the seventh round in 1998. Matt Holliday made three All-Star teams with the Rockies in the 2000s. His son is now the first top-five pick to be drafted by the same team his father played on. Ethan and <a data-player-guid=\"af43ed94-dd6e-3926-8b7d-537e8198ec14\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080633/jackson-holliday\">Jackson Holliday</a> (No. 1 to the Orioles in 2022) are the third set of brothers to go within the top 10, joining B.J. and Justin Upton and Dmitri and Delmon Young.</p><p>\"I'm super thankful for this opportunity,\" Ethan Holliday told ESPN. \"The Rockies are an incredible organization with which my family is very familiar, so I'm super juiced.\"</p><p>After the selection, Colorado posted a photo of Holliday as a child with the caption, \"Meant to be.\"</p><blockquote><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meant to be 💜 <a href=\"https://t.co/Ua1T5h3xT6\">pic.twitter.com/Ua1T5h3xT6</a></p>— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rockies/status/1944524445588300282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p>The top of this year's draft was unusual for several reasons, outside of the top two picks. It marked the first time in 13 years that only one college hitter (Arquette) was selected within the top 10, one year after seven college hitters went in that range. Six of the first 10 in 2025 were high school players, the first time that had occurred since 2002. And when the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f8a579c6-08b9-7584-141d-317d0645763b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a> chose Daniel Pierce 14th, it marked the ninth shortstop selected.</p><p>No outfielders were taken within the first 15 picks, marking only the third time that has happened. Hernandez and Carlson, meanwhile, became the first high school teammates ever to be selected in the top 10 in the same draft. In a few years, Hernandez, who had a .300/.371/.590 slash line in 33 games as a hitter and a 0.39 ERA in 53⅓ innings as a pitcher, could join a Pirates rotation alongside Skenes and <a data-player-guid=\"d6f815fb-3c01-3e45-9978-1f7337437b87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4918156/jared-jones\">Jared Jones</a>.</p><p>\"That was probably my first thought,\" Hernandez told MLB Network shortly after being drafted. \"Paul Skenes is unbelievable. I obviously know Jared Jones, so to be able to go through the process with them, be able to learn from those guys, is unbelievable.\"</p><p>Florida State lefty Jamie Arnold was ranked fifth by McDaniel heading into the draft and fell to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ath/athletics\">Athletics</a> at No. 11. Kyson Witherspoon, a right-hander from Oklahoma, was ranked 10th by ESPN and went to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6df06f6-785d-3900-4935-5fd13742e2ee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a> with the No. 15 pick.

He instead went 17th.</p><p>Left-handed shortstop Brady Ebel, son of <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> third-base coach Dino Ebel, was drafted 32nd by the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4750d73d-d92e-b390-758c-2c7b44a810db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a>, making Corona the first high school with three players selected in the first round of a single draft.

The entry date is expected to be figured out over the next few weeks as Louisiana Tech works out its departure from Conference USA, which is expected to cost at least $5 million.</p><p>It marks a return to the Sun Belt for Louisiana Tech, which was part of the league from 1991-2001 before departing for the WAC.</p><p>The addition of Louisiana Tech has long been expected, as the school emerged as the strong favorite even before the Pac-12 officially added Texas State last month, sources said. The Bulldogs also had been the focus on contingency conversations for the league in the fall of 2024.</p><p>Sources said the momentum for the move came from the schools in the Sun Belt West, as Tech's location gave it natural synergy with Louisiana, Louisiana-Monroe, Southern Miss and South Alabama as geographic rivals.</p><p>The move meshes with Sun Belt commissioner Keith Gill's stated philosophy of focusing on regional rivalries.</p><p>Louisiana Tech's recent football history has been shaky, as the Bulldogs haven't had a winning record since Skip Holtz went 10-3 in 2019. But there has been a strong history of success, with Holtz reaching seven straight bowl games from 2014 to 2020, and Sonny Dykes authoring a pair of good seasons in 2011 and 2012.</p><p>The move is also a strong one for baseball and softball, key Sun Belt sports in which Tech has been successful for decades. Tech's men's basketball program has 11 20-win seasons since 2013, and the women's program won two national titles in the 1980s and has reached 10 Final Fours. The women's team hasn't reached the NCAA tournament since 2011.</p><p>This will mark Louisiana Tech's third different league in the past two decades, as it transitioned from the WAC to Conference USA in 2013.</p><p>When Texas State flirted with the Mountain West in the fall of 2024, Louisiana Tech emerged as the favorite to join the league. Sun Belt leaders began discussions in earnest then, and those carried over.</p><p>There was some pushback from the Sun Belt's East teams, according to sources, but the league still achieved the required 10 votes out of 13 schools to approve the invitation. The other option discussed was the league staying at 13 teams.</p><p>The Sun Belt CEOs met virtually Thursday and set the table for the move, with the vote on Monday morning being more of a formality, sources said.</p>\n</div></div>"

Then, journeyman <a data-player-guid=\"e22c3186-cba0-fa71-cc28-f297e92579eb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10166/jj-spaun\">J.J. Spaun</a> shocked the golf world last month when he outlasted every player in the field and conquered Oakmont for his major victory in the U.S Open.</p><p>All three are in the Open this week as well as the rest of the top players in the world who will look to play their way into the story of this major season.</p><p>Here's a look at the 25 players most likely to be raising the Claret Jug come Sunday.</p><p><strong>1. Scottie Scheffler</strong></p><p>There is never much to say about Scheffler before any of these majors any more than just to always frame any prediction with the caveat that he might simply overpower the rest of the field in a way only he can. But what's more intriguing is seeing the three-time major champion make his way overseas and try to translate what makes him excel stateside to a vastly different style of golf.</p><p>At the Scottish Open this week, Scheffler finished tied for eighth and his record at Open Championships so far has been, relatively speaking, the most mixed of any of the other majors. In four starts, Scheffler's best finish is a tie for seventh at last year's Open (he finished tied for eighth in his Open debut in 2021) and he has two finishes just outside the top 20 in between. If you needed a reminder of how good he is, since 2021 (the first year he played all four majors) this is the only major in which Scheffler has more than one finish outside of the top 20 in 19 starts.</p><p>So, yes -- spoiler alert -- it's safe to say the best player in the world is probably going to contend this week.</p><p><strong>2. <a data-player-guid=\"f7192f24-1537-e91b-de6f-3548d5989626\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9780/jon-rahm\">Jon Rahm</a></strong></p><p>Perhaps no one has been slowly but surely trending in the right direction over the course of this year more than Rahm. Sure, there are the sheer number of top-10 LIV finishes he has accrued, but more notably is the way he has performed at the year's biggest events. Since last year's Open Championship at Royal Troon where he quietly finished in a tie for seventh, Rahm has found his game.</p><p>At the Masters, he finished 14th and followed up that performance with heading into the back nine at Quail Hollow with a real chance to win the PGA Championship. The Spaniard couldn't catch Scheffler, but the way he battled there and at Oakmont to finish tied for seventh felt quintessential Rahm. Nobody gets the competitive juices flowing more than him, and given the place he already occupies in European golf history, it feels as if he should have a Claret Jug on his résumé. The way Rahm has been playing recently, Portrush should set up well to give him a chance to do just that.</p><p><strong>3. Rory McIlroy</strong></p><p>Well, here we are again. The Open has returned to McIlroy's home country and he should -- emphasis on <em>should</em> -- be in the mix to win his sixth major championship. In 2019, that was also the sense and McIlroy proceeded to hit his first tee shot of the tournament out of bounds and missed the cut. It was an anticlimactic conclusion to a highly anticipated week.</p><p>A lot has changed since -- McIlroy has won a green jacket and is now a career grand slam winner. He has also underperformed since that historic win in April. Moreover, he has spoken at length about struggling to find motivation while also acknowledging that there is something about this specific tournament being in Northern Ireland that should spark something in him. Perhaps that spark came a week early, too. At the Scottish Open this past week, McIlroy played some of his best golf since the Masters, posting rounds of 68-65-66-68 to finish tied for second.</p><p><strong>4. <a data-player-guid=\"b9dfbb7c-0b61-caad-280f-512c677e8e8f\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10046/bryson-dechambeau\">Bryson DeChambeau</a></strong></p><p>In the same way that there has been a fascination with how DeChambeau strategizes and attacks Augusta National on a year-to-year basis, I'm always fascinated by how his game translates -- or doesn't -- to links golf. In seven appearances, DeChambeau has only one top-10 finish (Royal Liverpool in 2022) and has missed the cut three times, including last year at Royal Troon.</p><p>Anything is on the table this week for the two-time U.S. Open winner. You could tell me DeChambeau will somehow find his approach game and ride his short game to a commanding win at Portrush and I'd believe it. You could also tell me he struggles to keep it in the fairway under tough conditions and misses the cut. This style of game doesn't exactly fit DeChambeau, but watching him try to crack the code is worth the price of admission.</p><p><strong>5. <a data-player-guid=\"e23e62a8-8995-6b06-42f2-018c8a27e916\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10140/xander-schauffele\">Xander Schauffele</a></strong></p><p>The defending champion is only here, at No. 5, because he has had a relatively quiet year since winning two majors last year. After dealing with a rib injury at the beginning of the year, Schauffele took some time off and then took time to get back into form. He has only one top-10 finish this season and his approach game (top 10 in strokes gained on tour) has buoyed what has been an uncharacteristically bad year for his driver, short game and putting.</p><p>One of Schauffele's best qualities, his overall steadiness, is what allowed him to come from behind last year at Troon. This week probably will require plenty of that again at Portrush.</p><p><strong>6. <a data-player-guid=\"81036860-da90-8d9e-be1e-38fdfff557fc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4587/shane-lowry\">Shane Lowry</a></strong></p><p>Perhaps this is too high for Lowry, but in 2019, he rode the emotional wave of playing in a region he knows all too well to a commanding six-shot victory. The energy that Lowry will carry with him as fans cheer him on at a place where he has already won should be worth some kind of value to his chances this week.</p><p>Like McIlroy, he'll be one of the emotional favorites and though his game hasn't exactly been in great shape at the majors this year (two missed cuts and a tied for 42nd at the Masters) he does have four top-10 finishes on Tour and it wouldn't surprise anyone if he again played well at Portrush.</p><p><strong>7. <a data-player-guid=\"f65ea701-d15f-ac8e-a825-d135886bb6c1\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/436487/viktor-hovland\">Viktor Hovland</a></strong></p><p>Having a real sense for just exactly how Hovland will play at a major championship these days is a complete guessing game. Though he might be waxing in the news conference about how bad his swing feels and how he's chasing the perfect feel, he might end up contending the way he did at Oakmont last month where he finished third and had a real shot to win it on the back nine.</p><p>Earlier this year, Hovland missed three straight cuts. Shortly after, he won the Valspar Championship. Last year, Hovland finished third at the PGA Championship and also missed the cut at the three other majors, including the Open. Like DeChambeau, Hovland has the game to win this week, but the space between his ceiling and his floor is as wide as anyone near the top of this list.</p><p><strong>8. <a data-player-guid=\"68ba7252-dda8-08cb-6161-7930f3f163e7\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10592/collin-morikawa\">Collin Morikawa</a></strong></p><p>There aren't too many people in the world who are hitting the ball as well as Morikawa has this season. His ballstriking is as elite as ever and yet, despite having four top-10s this season, he can't seem to get over the line and win his first tournament since the 2023 Zozo Championship.</p><p>Morikawa knows how to win this tournament -- he did it in 2021 at Royal St. George's -- and though his game has objectively improved since then, there seems to be something missing in his ability to put four quality rounds together at the sport's top tournaments. This year, he finished 14th at the Masters but has gone backward, finishing tied for 50th at the PGA Championship and tied for 23rd at the U.S. Open. Theoretically, at a course like Portrush, Morikawa's iron play and accuracy off the tee should put him in contention. How his putting fares (currently 99th on tour this season) will determine how far up the leaderboard he can go.</p><p><strong>9. <a data-player-guid=\"b74101c7-47ae-12d2-20e6-4d78dec884d7\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/437597/ludvig-aberg\">Ludvig Åberg</a></strong></p><p>There was a point, right after Aberg's win at this year's Genesis Invitational, that it felt as if he was the talk of the sport. Since then, Aberg has fallen into a bit of a rut, missing four cuts (including at both the PGA and the U.S. Open) and only notched one top-10 finish (seventh place at the Masters). But Aberg is quietly lurking. At the Scottish last week, he seemed to find some form and finished tied for eighth and it would not be a shock if he entered the conversation at Portrush this week and hung around until Sunday.</p><p><strong>10. <a data-player-guid=\"a92f7d7e-7082-1351-2e7b-80fe13591e53\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5539/tommy-fleetwood\">Tommy Fleetwood</a></strong></p><p>Could this finally be the week? Fleetwood has come agonizingly close to not only a major win in recent years but really, grabbing any win that isn't on the DP World Tour. Fleetwood's game, with its elite ballstriking, feels primed for an Open Championship and this one, in particular, should suit his game. Though he missed the cut at Troon last year, in his two previous appearances at the Open, Fleetwood finished inside the top 10.</p><p><strong>11. <a data-player-guid=\"ab95205e-c964-97c7-c309-9841844bc546\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5553/tyrrell-hatton\">Tyrrell Hatton</a></strong></p><p>Perhaps Hatton should be a bit higher here. His performance at Oakmont was thoroughly impressive -- a tie for fourth was his best finish ever at a major and it feels as if he has been slowly trending toward being more of a factor on the weekend of major championships (he has two top-15 finishes in the past two years at Augusta).</p><p>Still, it's hard to shake the fact that Hatton's attitude, the way he responds to bad shots or bad breaks will be tested this week at a links setup like Portrush. Either way, it'll be fun to watch him try this week.</p><p><strong>12. <a data-player-guid=\"59d0d68c-2508-43cf-782c-8f649e786114\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/11378/robert-macintyre\">Robert MacIntyre</a></strong></p><p>MacIntyre was thoroughly impressive at Oakmont, battling the conditions and delay on Sunday and still carding a round of 2 under to hold the clubhouse lead and nearly get into a playoff with Spaun. MacIntyre is comfortable, to say the least, in this part of the world and on links courses. Though he missed the cut at the Scottish this past week, he has the game to contend at Portrush this week.</p><p><strong>13. <a data-player-guid=\"4c308ece-76d6-b5d7-697c-7d1d3535f1d0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5409/russell-henley\">Russell Henley</a></strong></p><p>Any time ballstriking and accuracy -- and not driving distance -- are prioritized in a particular venue, Henley seems to rise to the top and with good reason. He is a top-10 player in strokes gained and  has eight top-10s and one win this season. On the major front, Henley has struggled, missing the cut at the Masters and the PGA. At Oakmont, a top-10 finish felt more apt, and now he'll arrive at Portrush coming off a fifth-place finish at Troon last year.</p><p><strong>14. <a data-player-guid=\"bb9f978c-1e0f-b6ca-83ab-255e22dc6e78\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/6798/brooks-koepka\">Brooks Koepka</a></strong></p><p>It's hard to gauge where exactly Koepka's game is at the moment. Though he showed flashes of his old self Oakmont and talked at length about how lost his swing had been for a while, he withdrew from the following LIV event and finished tied for 32nd in its most recent tournament. If conditions at Portrush get gnarly this week, I could see Koepka rising, but it might also be that his game is simply not quite sharp enough right now to truly contend.</p><p><strong>15. <a data-player-guid=\"09533166-488d-e59f-7527-371673203ffc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/11099/joaquin-niemann\">Joaquín Niemann</a></strong></p><p>Here's the thing: Niemann should be higher than 15th on this list, but the reality is that, though he continues to excel on LIV (four wins this season), his performances at the sport's biggest events continue to underwhelm. Even this year, after finally recording his first top-10 finish at a major during the PGA, Niemann followed it up with a missed cut at Oakmont.</p><p><strong>16. <a data-player-guid=\"82c34ffc-6ce1-226c-0bf9-32fadb8fa779\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4848/justin-thomas\">Justin Thomas</a></strong></p><p>Thomas and the Open Championship don't seem to get along very well. In eight appearances at this event, Thomas has missed three cuts and never finished inside the top 10. But if you're looking for optimism, Thomas' best finish at an Open came at Portrush in 2019. That week, Thomas played four rounds of even-par golf or better. He'll be hoping to bring that same kind of display to the Dunluce course this week.</p><p><strong>17. <a data-player-guid=\"a11204a7-ef27-3f00-a28e-358ee5984e77\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9037/matt-fitzpatrick\">Matt Fitzpatrick</a></strong></p><p>I really don't know what to make of Fitzpatrick, who hasn't had a win on tour since 2023 and hasn't really contended at a major since his 2022 U.S. Open win, but he has shown some form going into this week with an eighth-place finish at the Rocket Classsic and a fourth-place finish this past week at the Scottish Open.</p><p><strong>18. <a data-player-guid=\"95a7c5d1-0ce2-473f-3221-d718985f576b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5467/jordan-spieth\">Jordan Spieth</a></strong></p><p>Speaking of players who you never know what you're going to get, here's Spieth. I have a hard time believing he actually has a chance to win this week, but even as erratic as he can be, Spieth has four top-10 finishes this season and has missed only two cuts. Last year, those two numbers were three and seven, respectively.</p><p><strong>19. <a data-player-guid=\"25cd1b68-2fd7-49bb-68e9-6abe8d8896ba\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/569/justin-rose\">Justin Rose</a></strong></p><p>Let it not be forgotten that Rose had a real shot to win this tournament last year at Troon and finished in a tie for second. Rose has had a roller-coaster year so far, taking McIlroy to a playoff at Augusta but missing three of his past four cuts, including at the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open. Still, at 44, he has proved he can still contend and an Open might be his best shot at getting a second major.</p><p><strong>20. <a data-player-guid=\"48dc0501-3550-c477-eddc-d6446b4ed611\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9126/corey-conners\">Corey Conners</a></strong></p><p>Much like Henley, Conners' superpower is his elite ballstriking, which should translate well to a links course such as Portrush. It's never quite felt as if Conners has ever raised his game enough to truly compete at a major championship (his best finish is a sixth-place finish at the 2022 Masters), but as it did in 2022 with <a data-player-guid=\"53a8100d-5131-cad6-20ed-b07bd3e7c1ce\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/1225/brian-harman\">Brian Harman</a>, the Open often has a tendency for giving us unexpected winners who simply keep the ball in front of them all week. Conners could certainly be that.</p><p><strong>21. J.J. Spaun</strong></p><p>Much like <a data-player-guid=\"44d75406-fd2f-49e2-ff9a-e3be72e82cf2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/11119/wyndham-clark\">Wyndham Clark</a> after the 2023 U.S. Open win, Spaun's career now takes on a different tone. Whether he is able to follow up his win at Oakmont with another competitive start at a major championship might be a tough ask, especially given this is Spaun's first time competing in an Open.</p><p><strong>22. <a data-player-guid=\"86559ec6-8953-21cd-90de-036710180257\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/440499/ben-griffin\">Ben Griffin</a></strong></p><p>How do you not include Griffin? The 29-year-old has been one of the best players on tour this season, winning twice and racking up eight top-10 finishes. Griffin hasn't had much luck with the Open -- he has missed the cut in two appearances -- but he's playing at a whole different level this year.</p><p><strong>23. <a data-player-guid=\"8f5653c5-b2c1-8fe7-6f83-fb976c9dec5d\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4513/keegan-bradley\">Keegan Bradley</a></strong></p><p>Five top-10 finishes, a top-10 at a major and a PGA Tour victory -- that's what Bradley's season looks like so far and the conversation about him being a playing captain at the Ryder Cup is already at a fever pitch. He might not need it, but a great finish at Portrush, or even an improbable win, would seal it.</p><p><strong>24. <a data-player-guid=\"7d66c751-33af-9c89-a201-8edc63e2ef75\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/8961/sepp-straka\">Sepp Straka</a></strong></p><p>In a move that can only be described as the opposite of Koepka, Straka has made a living off excelling at PGA Tour events but continues to struggle on the sport's biggest stages. Like Griffin, he also has two wins this season while adding five top-10s, but he has missed the cut at the Masters, the PGA and the U.S. Open.</p><p><strong>25. <a data-player-guid=\"8aa35976-1c69-544f-00b8-ecb47e0d1d67\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5860/hideki-matsuyama\">Hideki Matsuyama</a></strong></p><p>Matsuyama's best finish at an Open Championship came in his Open debut in 2013 when he finished tied for sixth at Muirfield. Can Matsuyama win? Of course. But it would take a lot for a player who hasn't had a top-10 finish this year outside of his win at the Sentry.</p><p><strong>First four out:</strong> <a data-player-guid=\"6188fa15-d916-fcdf-278d-8a80ca29d311\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9131/cameron-smith\">Cameron Smith</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"f35e551e-8602-99fc-d022-187826e10090\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5579/patrick-reed\">Patrick Reed</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"6acb7c43-d666-a9d5-ba00-43b863bc4bb8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/388/adam-scott\">Adam Scott</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"cf2e5e50-bc6d-4472-8298-e2743672441d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9938/sam-burns\">Sam Burns</a></p>\n</div></div>"

What did we think of the competition overall after an exhausting month of heat, travel and matches? Did the atmosphere (good at times, underwhelming at others) come close to meeting expectations, or does FIFA president Gianni Infantino have work to do if this tournament's going to be a long-term success?</em></p><p><em>As the confetti is cleared from MetLife Stadium, our reporters who covered the competition chime in with their final thoughts on the good, bad and ugly.</em></p><hr><h2>Final impressions: On a scale of 1-10 (1 being the worst, 10 being the best), what would you rate the 2025 CWC, and why?</h2><p><b>Mark Ogden:</b> Let's be positive. The football has been good, the noise and colour of the Brazil and Argentina supporters has really brought the tournament to life and eventually, the crowd numbers were at levels that FIFA would have wanted. Also, and this is important, the best team in the world -- PSG -- brought their A-game and really showcased the game and their quality to the audience in the U.S.</p><p>On the downside, 32 teams in the competition is too many, and that isn't a dig at sides such as Auckland City, Urawa Red Diamonds or Ulsan HD, who earned one point between them -- it's also about the likes of <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"dde04f24-2c69-420c-96af-9cde73ef3f6f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2790\">FC Salzburg</a>, who really had no right to be at the tournament. But overall, weather issues aside, it has been a positive first attempt at the competition. <b>RATING: 6/10</b></p><p><b>Lizzy Becherano:</b> The Club World Cup somewhat exceeded my expectations after watching teams take the competition seriously and dedicated fans filling most stadiums. Like many, I worried that the top teams would treat the competition like a series of preseason friendlies, playing lackluster football inside empty stadiums. Now, I am glad to look back at the tournament and be proven wrong to a certain extent. The tournament gave us moments of great football, with the excitement of watching underdogs take on the European greats.</p><p>There are still too many aspects of the Club World Cup to improve, however, in order for this tournament to truly be seen as successful rather than just an opportunity for more games. <b>RATING: 6/10</b></p><p><b>Rob Dawson:</b> It wasn't perfect, but it was a largely positive first edition of the expanded Club World Cup. There were some good games, shock results, drama and talking points. Most importantly, the fans showed up. The majority of the matches were well-attended and the South American fans brought the color and noise. The big European teams took it seriously, but -- crucially -- they didn't have it all their own way. Fluminense and Al Hilal showed exactly why the idea of a Club World Cup is valid.</p><p>As long as lessons are learned in terms of ticket pricing, travel and the timing of the tournament, there's every chance it could thrive going forward. <b>RATING: 7/10</b></p><p><b>Gab Marcotti:</b> It has been said time and again, but it's the first of its kind, it came about for self-serving reasons, staging a tournament in the U.S. in the summer isn't straight forward and we really had no clue what success would look like. Now at least we know the rest of the world can take on UEFA's big boys without embarrassing themselves.</p><p>We know there's genuine passion and interest, at least from fans of teams participating. That's a step forward, though there's a lot yet to be done. <b>RATING: 7/10</b></p><p><b>James Olley:</b> Somewhere in the middle of this bloated, ego-driven tournament is a good idea trying to emerge. FIFA's attempt to force this on the world at an accelerated pace rather than growing the competition more steadily over time -- it would have been a 24-team format in 2021 had the COVID pandemic not disrupted the calendar -- led to a version that was often difficult to like. The summer environment in the U.S. -- most obviously the weather but also the saturated domestic sports market -- made it tough for the competition to find a natural home. That said, there were positive elements that give it a platform on which to build.</p><p>The Brazilian teams added real flair and an edge to matches given their desire to challenge Europe's dominance. The support those teams enjoyed, along with the Argentine sides and Wydad AC of Tunisia, brought color and vibrancy to games. And nobody who saw the angry scenes after <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c43a00b9-2826-72b3-77a0-62730abc936e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=363\">Chelsea</a>'s victory over <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"79843c9e-0fe0-63b4-b591-9affc0dbd517\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=160\">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in the final can saw the players didn't care. But no matter how many times FIFA president Gianni Infantino says it is \"already the most successful club competition in the world,\" it doesn't actually make it so. Any competition has to earn that right, and the Club World Cup still has some way to go. <b>RATING: 5/10</b></p><p><b>Alex Kirkland:</b> We got some entertaining games, some great goals, some big crowds, and enough memorable moments that made you feel like this tournament was delivering on its premise: a truly global competition, bringing the best of world football -- Europe's elite teams, South America's passionate fans, giants being humbled, and underdogs being celebrated -- together in one place.</p><p>But there were really significant problems with the match-going experience for supporters, and concerns over player welfare, both largely due to the heat and the scheduling. It's also a tournament that was greeted with complete indifference by many football fans around the world. Dspite those issues, it went as well as could have been expected and, as a journalist covering the event, it was really quite fun. <b>RATING: 6/10</b></p><hr><h2>Team that surprised you (good or bad)</h2><p><b>Ogden:</b> <b>Fluminense</b> are the obvious one when you consider how much the struggled in the Brazilian league last season. To reach the semifinal was an achievement, even though they were easily beaten by Chelsea thanks to two goals from <a data-player-guid=\"23bd493f-7c2f-347f-92d9-78ed75a80811\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/339075/joao-pedro\">João Pedro</a>.</p><p><b><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"35cb1790-1e9c-000b-fa70-640509f3c06e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=929\">Al Hilal</a></b> also made an impact, striking a blow for the <a data-league-guid=\"00bb591a-b87e-39ee-91bf-1f9cf0ecfe5a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/KSA.1\">Saudi Pro League</a> by reaching the quarterfinals after eliminating <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a> in the round of 16. That was probably the shock of the tournament and, from FIFA's perspective, the kind of result that offered them complete vindication for opening it up to more teams from across the world.</p><p>And let's give some love to <b>Inter Miami</b> too, even though their place in the competition was controversially awarded by FIFA president Infantino. They reached the knockout stage and gave us a couple of magic moments from <a data-player-guid=\"dc5f8d51-332b-0ab2-b4b0-c97efdc624e0\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/208133/lionel-messi\">Lionel Messi</a>, so they rose to the occasion.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735072\" data-cerebro-id=\"68743349c0cf9d49642f56c0\" data-title=\"Leboeuf: Club World Cup final loss doesn't erase PSG's season\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_Leboeuf_Club_World_Cup_final_loss_doesnt_erase_PSGs_season_GLOBAL_20250713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_Leboeuf_Club_World_Cup_final_loss_doesnt_erase_PSGs_season_GLOBAL_20250713.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_Leboeuf_Club_World_Cup_final_loss_doesnt_erase_PSGs_season_GLOBAL_20250713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_Leboeuf_Club_World_Cup_final_loss_doesnt_erase_PSGs_season_GLOBAL_20250713.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_Leboeuf_Club_World_Cup_final_loss_doesnt_erase_PSGs_season_GLOBAL_20250713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_Leboeuf_Club_World_Cup_final_loss_doesnt_erase_PSGs_season_GLOBAL_20250713.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735072\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:36</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Leboeuf: Club World Cup final loss doesn't erase PSG's season</p><p>Frank Leboeuf assesses PSG's season after their 3-0 loss to Chelsea in the Club World Cup final.</p></div></div><p><b>Becherano:</b> <b><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"838e86e2-6645-c1b8-9fd2-46b6c1392876\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=437\">FC Porto</a></b> entered the Club World Cup as the favorites to top Group A and likely triumph over Inter Miami, Palmeiras and Al Ahly to advance to the round of 16 with three victories. Instead, the team struggled tremendously, going from favorites to failures quickly.</p><p>I expected a tough match between Porto and Palmeiras, even some difficulty for the European team to beat Inter Miami, but I never could have imagined the club letting in four goals from Al Ahly to conclude the competition with a 4-4 draw.</p><p><b>Dawson:</b> <b>Manchester City</b>.

But that was until they ran into Al Hilal, with the second half bringing back memories of everything that was wrong last season. It was chaotic and ragged and, in the end, City got what they deserved. It was a big surprise they didn't get further.</p><p><b>Marcotti:</b> Maybe it's the fact that I watched them twice in person, or maybe it's the fact that their fans raised the roof everywhere they went. But <b>Flamengo</b> stood out -- not just for the passion of their supporters (a cliche at this point, what else do you expect from the best supported club in Brazil), but for what they showed on the pitch, starting from their 3-1 victory over future world champions, Chelsea.</p><p>Boasting plenty of experience, tactical nous and tons of confidence, they honored the jersey once worn by Zico.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735236\" data-cerebro-id=\"687438bcf9cb241c51c4fe97\" data-title=\"FC crew slam 'unacceptable' outburst from Enrique after Club World Cup final\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735236\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:30</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>FC crew slam 'unacceptable' outburst from Enrique after Club World Cup final</p><p>The ESPN FC crew react to the scenes between Luis Enrique and the Chelsea squad after the Club World Cup final.</p></div></div><p><b>Olley:</b> It has to be <b>Chelsea</b>. They arrived at the tournament having quietened (but not silenced) doubts over manager Enzo Maresca, with some supporters questioning his style of play despite qualifying for the Champions League and winning the Europa Conference League. They depart with a second trophy, validation of his approach, a promising start made by several new signings and a prize-money pot worth at least £97m.</p><p>The indifference many have shown towards the Club World Cup may mean the afterglow from victory may not last as long as more conventional successes, but Maresca starts next season from a renewed position of strength. Moreover, this young group should now possess genuine belief they can go and challenge for the honors that matter most, having put PSG to the sword in such an impressive way.</p><p><b>Alex Kirkland:</b> It ended up being Chelsea, given how incredibly and unexpectedly well they performed in the final on Sunday, but before that: <b>Atletico Madrid</b>. Going into the tournament I genuinely thought they had a chance of progressing to the latter stages, given some key players -- like <a data-player-guid=\"0d838476-2120-cb34-db2f-a09e1c213769\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/208133/julian-alvarez\">Julián Álvarez</a> and Alexander Sorloth -- who'd been in really good form towards the end of the domestic season. In a short-form competition, I backed them to go on a run. And then they lost 4-0 to PSG in their opening game.</p><p>Even two subsequent wins against Seattle Sounders and Botafogo weren't enough to see them go through to the round of 16, and that was bad luck, but it was a disappointing and premature departure, nonetheless.</p><hr><h2>Best moment</h2><p><b>Ogden:</b> The best moment for me, by far, was the video of <a data-player-guid=\"6db4c779-7f2c-07f7-14ce-64d74f7d7fad\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/208133/cole-palmer\">Cole Palmer</a> riding around Times Square on an e-scooter on the Friday night before the Club World Cup final.</p><p>Chelsea have given their players room to breathe during their month in the U.S. because, at the same time as taking the competition seriously, they have also accepted that this tournament is taking place at a time when most players are on holiday or enjoying downtime ahead of the new season. Too often, clubs or international teams lock their players away in remote hotels or training bases and expect them to focus solely on football. But Chelsea have taken a grown-up approach during the Club World Cup and the image of Palmer riding through the crowds, while a huge image of him was on the digital screens in Times Square, was funny. It was also proof that footballers also have a life away from the game.</p><p><b>Becherano:</b> I was most impressed by the traveling fans throughout the first stage of the Club World Cup, with the Boca Juniors fans deserving a shoutout of their own. The entire group took over the city of Miami, from the beaches to the stands inside Hard Rock Stadium, bringing Buenos Aires to the streets of South Florida.</p><p>One of the best moments of the tournament came after the goal Miguel Merentiel scored in the second half of the match against <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"25b5e432-d3d2-939f-f73b-6e531a6fbd91\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=132\">Bayern Munich</a>, not because of the actual strike but the scenes that followed. The goal inspired the entire stadium to erupt in chaos making the press box tremble as supporters jumped and chanted in unison. For a brief moment, Boca Juniors fans truly believed they would win against Bayern, and the atmosphere reflected it.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45649052\" data-cerebro-id=\"6865a62fb7228b65b246044d\" data-title=\"Nicol: Complaints about heat shows nobody respects the Club World Cup\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0702%2Fdm_250702_COM_SOC_Analysis_Nicol_Complaints_about_heat_shows_nobody_respects_the_Club_World_Cup_20250702%2Fdm_250702_COM_SOC_Analysis_Nicol_Complaints_about_heat_shows_nobody_respects_the_Club_World_Cup_20250702.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0702%2Fdm_250702_COM_SOC_Analysis_Nicol_Complaints_about_heat_shows_nobody_respects_the_Club_World_Cup_20250702%2Fdm_250702_COM_SOC_Analysis_Nicol_Complaints_about_heat_shows_nobody_respects_the_Club_World_Cup_20250702.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0702%2Fdm_250702_COM_SOC_Analysis_Nicol_Complaints_about_heat_shows_nobody_respects_the_Club_World_Cup_20250702%2Fdm_250702_COM_SOC_Analysis_Nicol_Complaints_about_heat_shows_nobody_respects_the_Club_World_Cup_20250702.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45649052\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:00</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Nicol: Complaints about heat shows nobody respects the Club World Cup</p><p>Steve Nicol believes there would be no complaints about the weather if it was the World Cup.</p></div></div><p><b>Dawson:</b> Either Botafogo beating Paris Saint-Germain, or Flamengo beating Chelsea. It's nothing against PSG or Chelsea -- both deserved to reach the final -- but those results are exactly what a Club World Cup should be about. It would have been boring if the UEFA teams had blitzed everyone else.</p><p>The knockout rounds turning into a less-exciting version of the Champions League would not have suited anyone -- fans or FIFA. Botafogo and Flamengo scoring those early wins for South America against European heavyweights was proof that the premise of the tournament is sound. It just needs some tweaks and a viable place in the calendar.</p><p><b>Marcotti:</b> Wessam Abou Ali's hat trick against Porto. It finished 4-4 and turned out to be irrelevant for both clubs given that both sides went home early, but the Danish-born, Palestinian striker stole the show. The forward is on his way to becoming a legend in Egypt at Al Ahly, and the entire Arab world is cheering him on.</p><p><b>Olley:</b> Messi's free kick against Porto. Again, you have to park the cynical construction that led to this moment, with Inter Miami crowbarred into the tournament just so Messi could help sell tickets. Yet watching the 38-year-old bend in a superb match-winning free kick was still a heartwarming moment of endurance and longevity from arguably the game's greatest-ever player.</p><p>FIFA got its viral moment for social media; the world got a reminder that Messi is still capable of getting you off your seat.</p><p><b>Kirkland:</b> <a data-player-guid=\"13a8a402-8124-7609-c510-11cd93678276\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/208128/thibaut-courtois\">Thibaut Courtois</a>' 99th-minute save for <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"66434654-a8ba-a04c-98e5-6bbd0dbbb780\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a> vs. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6cdd01c7-3938-6f1d-0c24-c7cf7da68d2b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=124\">Borussia Dortmund</a>, clawing away <a data-player-guid=\"212aab7e-d1b6-9206-6cc0-ff821d0b3b5e\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/208133/marcel-sabitzer\">Marcel Sabitzer</a>'s near-perfect shot to preserve Madrid's 3-2 lead in the quarterfinals. It was one of those saves that got better with every replay you watched, and every fresh angle you saw. The fact that it was the decisive, last touch of the game, after a frantic finale that had three goals and a red card in added time -- a bizarre ending to an otherwise serene Madrid performance -- made it even better.</p><p>This is what makes a truly great goalkeeper: doing absolutely nothing, all game, and then, when it really matters, producing <em>that</em>.</p><hr><h2>Worst moment</h2><p><b>Ogden:</b> This is not really a moment, but the overall negative from the Club World Cup has been the weather, with disruptions caused by storms and issues that players, and supporters, have had to overcome with the heat during games. Any tournament played in a northern hemisphere summer will have heat issues -- Germany was very hot during Euro 2024 -- but the conditions in the United States during June and July have been so difficult at times that it has opened up a big conversation about how the 2026 Men's World Cup will be staged next year.</p><p>Infantino appeared to make a significant concession by saying that more daytime games will now be staged at stadiums with roofs at the World Cup, but kickoff times still to be finalized and with some games likely to be midday starts next year, we will only discover if lessons have truly been learned when those games are allocated venues and kickoff times.</p><p><b>Becherano:</b> Hard Rock Stadium played host to several exciting moments of the Club World Cup, with Boca Juniors fans turning the venue into La Bombonera North, a great goal by <a data-player-guid=\"48dceec1-d58e-842e-9c33-5285425995e6\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/3368/luis-suarez\">Luis Suárez</a> and celebrations from <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2778fe83-1f6d-517c-eb73-90ed8f28f8fe\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=7084\">Mamelodi Sundowns</a> fans. But as always, the problem with the stadium is not the action on the pitch, but the journey to that front gate. There were confusing instructions to find the entrance, miscommunication among staff on safety measures, and countless streets shut down to make the traffic into the media parking unbearable.</p><p>FIFA once made public transportation a requirement for cities and venues in order to submit a bid to host an official match or a World Cup, but the principle seems like a lost idea here. There are no public options available to reach the stadium, forcing fans and outlets to use Ubers, private cars or chartered buses, making the experience a nightmare for all.</p><p><b>Marcotti:</b> The weather delays that turned Chelsea vs. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c0d080f4-ddad-14be-1498-51f86a0f24fa\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=1929\">Benfica</a> into a four-hour slog that felt interminable.

Musiala's awful broken leg vs. PSG was the consequence of the type of challenge that could have happened at any time -- fatigue didn't appear an obvious factor -- but asking players to keep going for 11 months of the year is putting an excessive strain on the game's elite. It is a relief that there weren't more serious injuries.</p><p>The ongoing enmity between FIFA and UEFA make compromises thin on the ground, but the game is heading, almost inexorably, towards becoming an all-year round enterprise.

FIFA's decision to schedule a noon or 3 p.m. kick off at Hard Rock Stadium in the middle of summer will continue to be shocking. I understand the need to make football accessible to those watching in Europe or Asia, but not enough to consider risking a player's wellbeing by ordering a match to be played under the scorching Florida sun and humidity. Unless the venue boasts a roof, no game can or should be played before 7.30 p.m. local time.</p><p>Beyond the obvious safety and health concerns, one could also argue that no one plays their best under such conditions in Miami, Florida. Players often must conserve energy and lower paces to prioritize consistency and durability throughout the 90-minute matches. Coaches complained that players asked to be substituted out due to heat-induced exhaustion and cramps. How can officials expect the tournament to thrive if players are not given the proper conditions to play?</p><p><b>Dawson:</b> Have a completely open draw. FIFA decided to go straight to 32 teams, so can't then row back and make it a 16-team competition (which it should have been in the first place.) An open draw should -- in theory -- increase the probability of bigger games in the group stages; the knockout games were good, but it felt like the tournament took a while to get going.</p><p>Pitching more of the heavyweights against each other early on would kickstart things a lot earlier. You could also have a couple of incredibly tough groups with some real jeopardy before the round of 16.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45717108\" data-cerebro-id=\"68712c55ac2b6424ea634036\" data-title=\"The best of 'Ref Cam' from the 2025 Club World Cup\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0711%2Fdm_250711_The_best_of_Ref_Cam_from_the_2025_Club_World_Cup%2Fdm_250711_The_best_of_Ref_Cam_from_the_2025_Club_World_Cup.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0711%2Fdm_250711_The_best_of_Ref_Cam_from_the_2025_Club_World_Cup%2Fdm_250711_The_best_of_Ref_Cam_from_the_2025_Club_World_Cup.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0711%2Fdm_250711_The_best_of_Ref_Cam_from_the_2025_Club_World_Cup%2Fdm_250711_The_best_of_Ref_Cam_from_the_2025_Club_World_Cup.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45717108\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:34</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>The best of 'Ref Cam' from the 2025 Club World Cup</p><p>Catch the best bits of the footage captured on body cameras worn by referees at the Club World Cup.</p></div></div><p><b>Marcotti:</b> Expectations. Let's face it, FIFA felt it needed to promise mega prize money to get some of the European heavyweights on board and because the competition was in its infancy, it became tough to sell.

Let the competition grow and, if it attracts enough eyeballs, the big clubs will want to be there, and so will the sponsors.</p><p><b>Olley:</b> Reduce it to 16 teams. It'll never happen now, obviously -- money dictates that, if anything, they'll try and expand it to 48 teams to mirror the new international format. But a tighter version would be an easier sell globally and fewer games would place less of a demand on players who are already overworked.</p><p>Related to this, reduce the travel required.

It also hurt the competition's credibility that some of the best sides in the world on current form -- Liverpool again, or Barcelona, or Napoli -- were not included, even if the qualification criteria and logistics made that impossible.</p><p>It would be no surprise at all if FIFA somehow found a way to remedy both those challenges in time for 2029.</p>\n</div></div>"

He needs the extra time to study the tendencies of opposing hitters, formulate a game plan for that night's starting pitcher, nurse the incessant ailments inherent to his position in the training room, stay strong in the weight room, hone his left- and right-handed swings in the batting cage and set an example for the rest of the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"56d60582-088f-6848-5180-1fb04440cf87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a>. For hours every day, Raleigh consumes baseball because baseball consumes him.</p><p>\"I really love the game of baseball. I really do,\" he said. \"I love the scouting reports. I love catching. I love running the game. I love hitting, obviously. It's a game that you can love so much -- and at the same time, when things go wrong, it can be one of the worst things in the world. That's kind of what makes it so great, right?\"</p><p>It's July 5, the day after Raleigh celebrated another home run with fireworks with some teammates in South Lake Union, a mile from the Space Needle and 3 miles from T-Mobile Park, where Raleigh has spent 2025 doing things never done by a catcher in 150 years of major league baseball. Raleigh's numbers heading into this week's All-Star break elucidate the magnitude of his achievements -- 38 home runs, 1.011 OPS, 82 RBIs, all in just 94 games -- but it's the names he's chasing that give them gravitas. With 66 games left this season, Raleigh is threatening to break Mickey Mantle's single-season home run record for a switch-hitter (54) and Ken Griffey Jr.'s single-season home run record for a Mariner (56). He fell one shy of Barry Bonds' record for first-half home runs (39).</p><p>\"At the beginning of the year, it was like, all right, he is off to a great start,\" said <a data-player-guid=\"b7e723ac-844e-37c9-9543-0c85fb5cc5e2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4629089/bryan-woo\">Bryan Woo</a>, the Mariners' All-Star right-hander and Raleigh's roommate last year. \"And then he just kept going and it was like, wow, this is pretty cool. And then it was like, holy s---, he's going off. And now it's kind of just like, what is going on? Over the last month, I feel like everybody realized it's a historic season. It's not just a really good one or one of the best in the league -- it's something that's never been done. At this point, most guys are just kind of looking at each other every time he hits a homer or has a really good game. We don't really know what to make of it. We're kind of just as dumbfounded as all the fans are.\"</p><p>Raleigh's emergence as a legitimate threat to what once looked like a runaway American League MVP campaign by <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2b9cedf3-ce60-0bcf-fafe-8cd055255685\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a> star <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a> has thrust Seattle's secret -- a switch-hitting, upper deck-hunting, Platinum Glove-winning, every day-playing, badonkadonk-jiggling folk hero -- into the national spotlight. The latest turn comes <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45576753/2025-mlb-all-star-game-schedule-how-watch-rosters\">Monday night in Atlanta at 8 p.m.</a>, when the 28-year-old Raleigh will try to become the first switch-hitter and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45583704/mlb-2025-all-star-home-run-derby-bracket-analysis-participants\">first catcher to win the Home Run Derby</a>.</p><p>Todd Raleigh, his father and a longtime college coach, will throw the pitches Raleigh intends to send over the fence. Squatting behind the plate will be his 15-year-old brother, Todd Jr., privy to the best view at Truist Park. That this moment turned into a Raleigh family affair is poetic. If not for his father -- for the long legacy of Raleighs in baseball forged in the unlikeliest of places -- the Big Dumper wouldn't be here.</p><hr><p><strong>LONG BEFORE HE</strong> showed up at T-Mobile Park at noon, <a data-player-guid=\"6c27dcb5-a741-d526-b5ac-f3988e288a70\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41292/cal-raleigh\">Cal Raleigh</a> took a yellow school bus to get his daily baseball fix. He would leave Cullowee Valley Elementary at 3:10 p.m., ride about a mile to Hennon Stadium, change into a Western Carolina University uniform and watch his dad work.</p><p>Todd Raleigh grew up in Swanton, Vermont, where his family was baseball royalty. His oldest brother, John, won two state titles at Missisquoi Valley Union High before dying a year after graduation of lymphoma. The middle Raleigh brother, Matt, captured three state championships and twice hit more than 30 home runs in a minor league season, topping out at Triple-A. With a pair of state championships on his résumé, Todd wanted to go to Western Carolina, so he hitchhiked down the East Coast, made the team and thrived. When he returned as a coach, he found a new home.</p><p>In his firstborn, Todd found a kindred spirit. Raleigh's love of baseball manifested itself relentlessly. At the grocery store, he pantomimed swings in the aisles. At home, he emulated the stances of every Catamounts player. When he was home sick, Raleigh would draw diagrams of uniforms. He gave lineup suggestions to Todd. In a home video taken when he was 8 years old, Raleigh sang: \"I'm the Home Run Derby champ. I'm the Home Run Derby champ.\"</p><p>Before Raleigh entered fifth grade, Todd's success at Western Carolina earned him the head coaching job at the University of Tennessee, one of the country's premier college programs. In Knoxville, Raleigh encountered the first challenges to his love of the game. He got cut from his middle-school team. Todd, who had recruited <a data-player-guid=\"84b5fdeb-d79c-dc9c-8023-5cad2a921ca4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts\">Mookie Betts</a> to play for the Volunteers only to see him sign with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6df06f6-785d-3900-4935-5fd13742e2ee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a> out of high school, got fired after four seasons. At Knoxville Catholic, a coach told Raleigh he was a Division III talent. As he fumed, Todd offered him some advice: \"Get so much better that you can't be told no.\" The family returned to North Carolina, and Raleigh broke out at Smoky Mountain High. He went to Florida State and was named a freshman All-American. Following a sophomore slump, he thrived as a junior, hitting 13 home runs and walking more than he struck out. Scouts loved his power from both sides of the plate but worried that at 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds, he wasn't athletic enough to remain at catcher and recommended a move to first base.</p><p>Raleigh refused. Their eyes were the issue, not his skills. Six catchers went ahead of him in the 2018 draft. Seattle plucked Raleigh with the 90th pick in the draft, hopeful a third-rounder could evolve into a big leaguer. When Raleigh arrived at Low-A Everett that year, Tony Arnerich, the Mariners' field coordinator and catching instructor, watched one session of him catching and admitted to being surprised.</p><p>\"You're nothing like what I expected, what everybody said you were,\" Arnerich said.</p><p>\"Well, what did they say?\" Raleigh responded.</p><p>They said the sorts of things Raleigh had already spent years repurposing into motivation. He'd been told he wasn't good enough in sixth grade. Or high school. Or college. He was a switch-hitter who, despite almost even splits against right- and left-handed pitching, was advised to pick one side to hit from, because if he were intent on catching, the job was too demanding to bifurcate time spent on swinging. Even after Raleigh thrived in his debut season in Seattle's farm system, hit 29 home runs in his second year and outhit everyone at the team's minor league alternate site in 2020, he never came close to a top 100 prospect list. In an organization with <a data-player-guid=\"b4376163-318a-7510-fe79-bbb7ee9acf0d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41044/julio-rodriguez\">Julio Rodriguez</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"70558f21-da31-ecfb-c1ea-081e98803626\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41221/logan-gilbert\">Logan Gilbert</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"1a5ac7a8-3d43-3bba-ac79-580f0a46e25f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42406/george-kirby\">George Kirby</a> and Jarred Kelenic hoarding all the attention, Raleigh always registered as an afterthought.</p><p>Raleigh joined Gilbert and Kelenic on Seattle's big league roster in July 2021, with <a href=\"https://x.com/jarredkelenic/status/1414285412491698177\">Kelenic introducing to the masses</a> the nickname he had given Raleigh in the minor leagues. The Big Dumper was a big disappointment, unable to muster even a .200 batting average. The 2022 season was worse. Following an April of inconsistent playing time, batting .083/.214/.208, Raleigh was shipped back to AAA.</p><p>\"I wasn't sure that he was going to stick around,\" Gilbert said, \"much less turn into what he is today.\"</p><p>Raleigh wasn't sure, either. Growing up, he had heard his father talk about the major leagues with reverence. There was Low-A, High-A, Double-A and Triple-A. The big leagues, Todd said, were Eight-A, exponentially harder than the minors, and they had humbled Raleigh to the point of sulking, something Todd refused to oblige.</p><p>\"I was just angry at the world,\" Raleigh said. \"I was mad, I was upset, I wasn't playing as much as I would've liked, I wasn't playing well. A lot of complaining. He sat me down and was like, 'Hey, you don't realize how lucky you are to be where you're at. You know, this is what you dreamed of your whole life, and you're sitting here complaining about it, and you're not doing anything about it.' And it really changed my perspective on a lot of things. I started looking at things through a different lens. It was something I needed that I didn't know I needed.\"</p><p>The Mariners gave Raleigh a 48-hour window to report to Triple-A Tacoma. He showed up a day early, batted third in the lineup, went 0-for-4, called Todd and said: \"I'm never going back down again.\" Raleigh needed to work on his ability to compartmentalize, Todd told him, not just separating his duties as a catcher from those as a hitter but his bad days from the chaos they sowed in his mind.</p><p>\"Cal is a processor,\" Todd said. \"It takes him a couple days to consider something and understand it. Eventually, he comes around.\"</p><p>Raleigh saw the wisdom in Todd's advice. He needed to clear his head, so he took walks in the morning, sometimes seeking refuge in nearby churches. He found the swings that had disappeared. He shed the malaise, ditched the attitude and poured his energy into the work -- the early arrivals, the meticulous preparation, the game within the game. Barely a week after Raleigh's demotion, Mariners catcher <a data-player-guid=\"679ff476-5598-54cb-5f35-5dbd4d0a403c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33225/tom-murphy\">Tom Murphy</a> separated his left shoulder, prompting Seattle to recall the debugged version of Raleigh.</p><p>After five hitless games that collapsed his batting average to .065, Raleigh hunted a fastball from <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> reliever <a data-player-guid=\"9f22bb2f-30a7-f947-d8ef-874449f6e090\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39685/drew-smith\">Drew Smith</a> and parked it 435 feet onto the right-field concourse at Citi Field, a titanic shot that reminded him of his capabilities. Raleigh homered again three days later. And again five days after that. He went deep six more times in June and was a menace behind the plate, on his way to throwing out an AL-best 25 attempted base stealers.</p><p>\"I don't care how touted you are,\" Todd said. \"If there's a crack in your character, a crack in your work ethic, a physical flaw, you're going to get exposed.\"</p><p>Raleigh was the one doing the exposing. With Murphy out for the season, he assumed full-time catching duties and racked up 25 home runs as Seattle surged toward its first postseason berth in 21 years, the longest drought in major North American men's professional sports. Out of the lineup on Sept. 30, 2022, a day after catching all 188 pitches of an 11-inning game, he entered in the ninth inning as a pinch hitter.</p><p>The game was tied 1-1, with a win needed to seal the Mariners' spot in the postseason. Raleigh worked the count against Oakland right-hander Domingo Acevedo full and fouled off the sixth pitch of the at-bat. Fans around the stadium stood, hoping to conjure the halcyon days of Griffey and Edgar Martinez and Randy Johnson, the three Hall of Famers who brought aura to Seattle baseball but never a World Series appearance. Acevedo left a slider over the plate, low and inside. Raleigh loosed his bat. The ball surged into the night, ricocheted off a window of the Hit It Here Café in right field and, for an instant, at least, nearly a half-century of Mariners failures vanished. Of all the consequential hits in Mariners history -- Ichiro Suzuki breaking Rogers Hornsby's single-season hit record, Martinez's double that scored Griffey from first in the 1995 division series against the Yankees -- none landed with the euphoric release of Raleigh's walk-off. It was a bloodletting and a portent.</p><p>Raleigh wasn't just a part of the Mariners' future; he was a foundational element. He played in 145 games the next year -- second most in the league -- and hit 30 home runs. Last year, he bumped his homer total to 34 and logged 153 games, a rarely seen figure for a catcher made even more impressive by his predilection to play through injuries. When he hit the walk-off in 2022, Raleigh was playing with a broken left thumb that had a torn ligament. Gilbert saw him play through a burst blood vessel in his eye and an ear gushing blood after getting struck on a backswing.</p><p>\"That's what really does it for me,\" Gilbert said. \"Love the homers, love how you play, all that kind of stuff. When you're banged up and you don't say a word and go out there, I'm like, 'OK, this guy's a gamer.' Every game he's back there, he takes a foul ball. Like, 'Oh, that one looked bad. OK, it's been like 20 seconds -- maybe he's milking it.' You forget about it. And then you go in the training room and there's a huge black-and-purple spot on his thigh or wherever it is, and you're like, 'OK, he was actually pretending nothing happened, not milking it.' I wouldn't be able to walk.\"</p><p>Putting Humpty Dumper back together again takes treatment of all manner and variety. Ice, heat, massage, stimulation. One night, Mariners general manager Justin Hollander walked into the training room to see acupuncture needles all over Raleigh's body, as if he were trying to cosplay Pinhead.</p><p>\"And the next morning,\" Hollander said, \"there's one person there before everyone, sitting in the cafeteria with a stack of advance papers: Cal.\"</p><p>In the work and the triumph it cultivated, Raleigh had validated his promise never to return to Triple-A. He didn't just belong. He embodied the big in big leagues. He was turning into something new -- more self-assured, more capable, the sort of character onto whom Seattle could latch with no reservation.</p><hr><p><strong>IN SEATTLE'S OPENING</strong> series this year, a between-innings video with Cal Raleigh's deadpan face flashed on the scoreboard. From commercials to vignettes to promotions, no team in baseball does entertainment with as much creative flair as the Mariners. Even for them this pushed the envelope of absurdity. The premise was simple: Send an email to bigdumper@mariners.com, and Raleigh will help you dump a problematic person in your life.</p><p>\"Tom, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but it's not working with Lindsay,\" Raleigh said. \"Don't worry, though. When one door closes, another one opens. Specifically, a door to a new apartment, because your current lease is in Lindsay's name. Bummer.\"</p><p>Even if it was a bit -- the Mariners have received real requests at the email address for boyfriends, girlfriends, friends and others, although not one of them was from Lindsay -- it illustrated the full commodification of the Big Dumper persona by the Mariners and the full embrace of it by Raleigh. Baseball had seen the Big Train (Walter Johnson), the Big Hurt (Frank Thomas), the Big Unit (Randy Johnson) and dozens more Bigs. Never had one been assigned on account of thiccness alone.</p><p>\"It's not the one you write up in your mind when you're thinking of nicknames,\" Raleigh said. \"But, I mean ... it's true. That's who I am.\"</p><p>Raleigh's was the posterior that kept on giving, offering an endless supply of promotions that helped burrow him into the psyche of a wounded fan base. Instead of \"RALEIGH\" running across the nameplate of replica jerseys, the Mariners sell a No. 29 jersey that says \"BIG DUMPER.\" They made Big Dumper onesies and sold out almost immediately. He filmed a commercial for Big Dumper Trucking, a company that does not exist.</p><p>\"Part of what makes Cal so lovable is he's an everyman,\" said Jerry Dipoto, the Mariners' president of baseball operations. \"He's blue collar. Shows up in his truck. Does his job. That's the beauty of him. He's not flashy. He's not boisterous. He's not there to create his own brand. He's been almost embarrassed by all the attention he's received.\"</p><p>Connecting with Seattle mattered to Raleigh. Last year, he meandered outside of T-Mobile to a stage where fans were getting their heads shaved by Jay Buhner, the slugging outfielder of the team's 1990s glory days. For 30 years, Buhner Buzz Cut night entitled people willing to sport Buhner's signature chrome-dome look to a T-shirt and free ticket to a Mariners game. Off came Raleigh's locks, courtesy of Buhner.</p><p>The Mariners sold a Cal-Zone calzone at concession stands and replaced it this year with Lil' Dumpers soup dumplings. They take advantage of Raleigh's sense of humor (a video of him and Gilbert asking each other questions when hooked up to a polygraph is laced with laugh-out-loud moments) and his trust in them (they once convinced Raleigh that a slow-motion camera was broken, so he needed to move -- and yell -- in slow motion). They renamed right field the Dump Yard for a night. \"We thought about calling the people sitting in the section the Dumplings,\" said Gregg Greene, the Mariners' longtime marketing guru, \"but we realized that's probably not a great name for our fans.\"</p><p>By the time All-Star voting commenced this year, the Mariners urged fans to \"Be a Peach, Vote Cal,\" using a fruit emoji to secure votes. At one point, they put together an all-booty-song walk-up playlist, including \"Baby Got Back\" by Seattle native Sir Mix-A-Lot for Raleigh. He finished with the second-most votes in the AL behind Judge.</p><p>When he walks around Seattle and gets recognized, fans typically don't yell his name. It's almost always \"Dumper.\" And as advantageous as an ample derriere can be for baseball players -- the lower half of a swing generates power, not the upper half -- its drawbacks occasionally reveal themselves. On the night of the ceremony in which Raleigh won the Seattle Sports Commission's men's Sports Star of the Year award in late February, the fly on his suit pants got stuck. He asked the front desk of the hotel in which he was staying for safety pins. They didn't help. A nearby Men's Wearhouse agreed to stay open late to accommodate Raleigh. Finding a pair of off-the-rack pants that fit was a lost cause. Eventually, he settled on a pair of jeans and apologized to the crowd at the event for his lack of formal attire due to \"a zipper incident.\"</p><p>They laughed, and they cheered, and they reminded Raleigh why he had been open to signing a long-term contract with the franchise. The Mariners had approached Raleigh in the 2023-24 offseason about a deal. He demurred. At the winter meetings in December 2024, Dipoto and Hollander broached the topic again and were told to table it until spring training. The team sent a proposal early in the spring. Before he considered it, Raleigh said, he needed to learn more about the future of the franchise.</p><p>The Mariners have arguably the best farm system in baseball, but they consistently rank in the middle of the pack in money spent on players, never carrying a payroll that exceeds $158 million into the season. Following a spring training workout, Raleigh -- still in full uniform -- met Dipoto and Hollander in a suite at the team's Arizona facility. He wanted to understand more about the Mariners' future: the minor leaguers, the front office's philosophies, how the competition in the AL West projects. He carried a notebook filled with questions and started firing away.</p><p>What are prospects' timelines? How is the roster evolving? Are Gilbert and Kirby and Woo and right-handers <a data-player-guid=\"f862027a-e64c-3576-3bea-85dad3d5b39f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35124/luis-castillo\">Luis Castillo</a> and Bryce Miller going to be on this team as free agency approaches? Or will the team trade them to start the cycle that has kept Tampa Bay and Milwaukee consistently in the playoff mix? Because, Raleigh said, if this group stays together, it can win a World Series. They spoke for 2½ hours, and the answers were clearly satisfactory, because soon thereafter Raleigh agreed to a six-year, $105 million context extension that can keep him in a Mariners uniform through 2031.</p><p>\"Cal wants to win,\" Dipoto said. \"He wants to eat your face off. He's an intense competitor. Cal says a lot without saying much.\"</p><hr><p><strong>WHAT RALEIGH WILL</strong> say is that all of this happened for a reason. Getting cut and being told what he can't be and struggling and hearing the hard truth from his father led him to the point where he can find the best version of himself -- where Cal Raleigh steps into a Mariners uniform, like Clark Kent in a phone booth, and becomes the Big Dumper, punisher of baseballs. It's freeing, really, allowing him to look beyond today and toward goals bigger than him.</p><p>\"Now that I've kind of established myself in the league and learned I can be an everyday catcher, I can hit, I can call a game, I can do all these things, you start turning your attention to: All right, now I want to win a World Series,\" Raleigh said. \"I got my contract. Now I really want to deliver for these fans, for my family, for myself to prove that I can do this. That's what drives me and consumes me.\"</p><p>As gratifying as individual achievements can be, Raleigh is wholly unconcerned with how he stacks up to Judge in the MVP race. He acknowledged that being on the field for the Home Run Derby with his father and brother is more important to him than winning it. He finds more fulfillment in group success, starting with this Mariners team, which at times looks like it can win a championship and at others like another disappointment.</p><p>Raleigh is determined to do his part to avoid the fates of the 2023 and 2024 Mariners teams. His defense is still elite, from arm to blocking to framing. The bat is calibrated toward his strengths, with the second-highest fly ball rate of any hitter in the pitch-tracking era (57.1%) and a pull rate that ranks 25th out of the 3,500-plus qualified seasons, according to FanGraphs. The durability is unparalleled: only two days off in the first half. And the leadership, long a work in progress, is coming into its own: Raleigh now wields the microphone on the team plane and bus, a role given to the steward of each team.</p><p>Sometimes it gets awkward, Raleigh's inherent sheepishness exposing itself. When he was named an All-Star starter, the first thing he did was apologize to the team for the hullabaloo around him. \"It's not the same anymore,\" Raleigh said, and he's right. Hit 38 home runs in the first half and it's not going to be. He said the same to Todd recently, and his father responded in his inimitable fashion.</p><p>\"I said, 'Well, wah, wah, wah. This is a privilege, right? Do you want to not be in there? I'll trade with you. How's that?'\" Todd said. \"He gets it. You just gotta learn to deal with it.\"</p><p>So he learns. And he grows. And he shows up at noon, always ready to put in a good day's work, loving every last moment.</p>\n</div></div>"

His swing is perfect for the Derby: He leads MLB this season in both pull percentage and fly ball percentage, so it's not as if he needs to recalibrate it to succeed. He has also become a prolific hitter from the right side this season -- 16 home runs in 102 at-bats -- and his ability to switch between right- and left-handed pitching offers a potential advantage. No switch-hitter (or catcher for that matter) has won a Home Run Derby. The Big Dumper is primed to be the first, beating Buxton in the finals.</p><p><strong>Alden Gonzalez</strong>: Cruz. He might be wildly inconsistent at this point in his career, but he is perfect for the Derby -- young enough to possess the stamina required for a taxing event that could become exhausting in the Atlanta heat; left-handed, in a ballpark where the ball carries out better to right field; and, most importantly, capable of hitting balls at incomprehensible velocities. Raleigh will put on a good show from both sides of the plate but will come in second.</p><p><strong>Buster Olney</strong>: Olson. He is effectively pinch-hitting for Acuna, and because he received word in the past 72 hours of his participation, he hasn't had the practice rounds that the other competitors have been going through. But he's the only person in this group who has done the Derby before, which means he has experienced the accelerated pace, adrenaline and push of the crowd.</p><p>His pitcher, Eddie Perez, knows something about performing in a full stadium in Atlanta. And, as Olson acknowledged in a conversation Sunday, the park generally favors left-handed hitters because of the larger distances that right-handed hitters must cover in left field.</p><p><strong>Jesse Rogers: </strong>Olson. Home-field advantage will mean something this year as hitting in 90-plus degree heat and humidity will be an extra challenge in Atlanta. Olson understands that and can pace himself accordingly. Plus, he was a late addition. He has got nothing to lose. He'll outlast the young bucks in the field. And I'm not putting Raleigh any lower than second -- his first half screams that he'll be in the finals against Olson.</p><p><strong>Jorge Castillo: </strong>Wood. His mammoth power isn't disputed -- he can jack baseballs to all fields. But the slight defect in his power package is that he doesn't hit the ball in the air nearly as often as a typical slugger. Wood ranks 126th out of 155 qualified hitters across the majors in fly ball percentage. And he <em>still</em> has swatted 24 home runs this season. So, in an event where he's going to do everything he can to lift baseballs, hitting fly balls won't be an issue, and Wood is going to show off that gigantic power en route to a victory over Cruz in the finals.</p><hr><h2>Who will hit the longest home run of the night -- and how far?</h2><p><strong>Passan</strong>: Cruz hits the ball harder than anyone in baseball history. He's the choice here, at 493 feet.</p><p><strong>Gonzalez</strong>: If you exclude the Coors Field version, there have been just six Statcast-era Derby home runs that have traveled 497-plus feet. They were compiled by two men: <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"85fd807f-1324-d722-3965-eece0c5ad858\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30583/giancarlo-stanton\">Giancarlo Stanton</a>. James Wood -- all 6-foot-7, 234 pounds of him -- will become the third.</p><p><strong>Olney</strong>: James Wood has the easy Stanton- and Judge-type power, and he will clear the Chophouse with the longest homer. Let's say 497 feet.</p><p><strong>Rogers</strong>: Hopefully he doesn't injure himself doing it, but Buxton will break out his massive strength and crush a ball at least 505 feet. I don't see him advancing far in the event, but for one swing, he'll own the night.</p><p><strong>Castillo</strong>: Cruz hits baseballs hard and far. He'll crush a few bombs, and one will reach an even 500 feet.</p><hr><h2>Who is the one slugger fans will know much better after the Derby?</h2><p><strong>Passan</strong>: Buxton capped his first half with a cycle on Saturday, and he'll carry that into the Derby, where he will remind the world why he was baseball's No. 1 prospect in 2015. Buxton's talent has never been in question, just his health. And with his body feeling right, he has the opportunity to put on a show fans won't soon forget.</p><p><strong>Olney</strong>: Caminero isn't a big name and wasn't a high-end prospect like Wood was earlier in his career. Just 3½ years ago, Caminero was dealt to the Rays by the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6ad8fa03-36bc-baab-c76a-345b6544424d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-guardians\">Cleveland Guardians</a> in a relatively minor November trade for pitcher <a data-player-guid=\"8f0265ac-013f-2e58-3e69-69c73510cd04\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39716/tobias-myers\">Tobias Myers</a>. But since then, he has refined his ability to cover inside pitches and is blossoming this year into a player with ridiculous power. He won't win the Derby, but he'll open some eyes.</p><hr><h2>What's the one moment we'll all be talking about long after this Derby ends?</h2><p><strong>Gonzalez</strong>: The incredible distances and velocities that will be reached, particularly by Wood, Cruz, Caminero, Raleigh and Buxton. The hot, humid weather at Truist Park will only aid the mind-blowing power that will be on display Monday night.</p><p><strong>Rogers</strong>: The exhaustion on the hitter's faces, swinging for home run after home run in the heat and humidity of Hot-lanta!</p><p><strong>Castillo</strong>: Cruz's 500-foot blast and a bunch of other lasers he hits in the first two rounds before running out of gas in the finals.</p>\n</div></div>"

The New Zealander once again showed he's in a completely different class on road and street courses than his rivals as he led 97 of 110 laps to win from pole at Sonoma Raceway.</p><p>He celebrated with the traditional burnout, then his Trackhouse crew changed the tires on the No. 88 Chevrolet so he could do a second smoke-inducing spin on his way to victory lane. He also kept with his own tradition and kicked a rugby ball into the grandstands.</p><p>\"It means everything. That's why I race cars. I had an amazing time in Australia, and then to come here and the last couple weeks, or years, actually, has been a dream come true,\" said van Gisbergen. \"I've really enjoyed my time in NASCAR. Thanks, everyone, for making me feel so welcome. I hope I'm here for a long time to come.\"</p><p>All three of his wins this year have been from pole -- which tied him with Jeff Gordon for a NASCAR record of three consecutive road course victories from the top starting spot.

Mission accomplished.</p><p>The 18-year-old forward launched at least 20 shots in both of his summer league appearances, something he did only twice in 37 games during his lone season at Duke.</p><p>\"I'm exhausted,\" Flagg said after his 31-point performance in Saturday's loss to the Spurs. \"I'm not used to bringing the ball up like that, and every time I'm getting the ball full court, I had somebody on my hip playing 94 feet. So, definitely not used to that, but I think I did a solid job of bringing it up against pressure and trying to set up our different actions.\"</p><p>Although Flagg had a poor shooting effort in the opener, going 5-of-21 from the floor, the Mavs were pleased with his two outings. He consistently made good reads and created open looks for teammates, despite finishing with just five assists. He committed only three turnovers overall and appeared to get more comfortable against ball pressure in real time. Case in point against the Spurs: The last two possessions of the third quarter, when Flagg escaped <a data-player-guid=\"bf077b0c-98d4-3009-bb34-a07e5a64f4d2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5061568/carter-bryant\">Carter Bryant</a>'s pressure in the backcourt and attacked for an and-1 layup then drove down the lane for a dunk out of a half-court set.</p><p>\"Incredible for a kid who we're saying, 'We're going to give you the basketball and they're going to pick you up full court,'\" Mavs summer league coach Josh Broghamer said. \"Everyone has 10 fouls, so there is no penalty for grabbing and holding. The referees can't call everything on every play, so it's even more exhausting and tougher on him than a regular game.\" -- <em>Tim MacMahon</em></p><hr><h2>Harper debuts vs. Flagg</h2><p>After missing the Spurs' run in the California Classic and their Las Vegas opener due to a minor groin injury, No. 2 pick Dylan Harper returned just in time to face Flagg in Saturday's anticipated matchup. Limited to 20 minutes, Harper still showed plenty of the skills that made him the consensus second-best prospect after Flagg.</p><p>Perhaps Harper's most impressive highlight came on defense, as he raced back in transition to swat <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4433629/ryan-nembhard\">Ryan Nembhard</a>'s transition layup, getting well off the court to protect the rim. On offense, Harper's ability to draw contact stood out. He went 6-of-7 at the foul line, including finishing through a Flagg foul for a three-point play.</p><p>The biggest question mark about Harper remains his shooting, as he missed all four of his 3-point attempts. How quickly he improves will determine how soon he joins the San Antonio veterans (who were sitting courtside Saturday) as a starter. --<em> Kevin Pelton</em></p><hr><h2>Bulls' Essengue will be a project</h2><p>When the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\">Chicago Bulls</a> selected <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5242496/noa-essengue\">Noa Essengue</a> at No.12, they readily acknowledged how the 18-year-old from France -- the second-youngest player in the draft -- was not coming into the league as a finished product. But Essengue's first appearance of the summer on Friday showed just how raw of a talent he truly is.</p><p>He scored five points in 25 minutes, dribbled the ball off his foot, knocked the ball into the rim while trying to grab a rebound and acknowledged after the game he was surprised by the level of physicality.</p><p>Essengue was better and more comfortable in his second game on Saturday, and the Bulls staff was happy with the way he responded. But Chicago doesn't expect Essengue to be a key part of its rotation entering the season, and it's unclear if he'll be much of a contributor at all during the 2025-26 campaign. -- <em>Jamal Collier </em></p><hr><h2>Impressive early flashes from Kings' Clifford</h2><p>Going into the draft, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4702384/nique-clifford\">Nique Clifford</a> was labeled a plug-and-play Swiss Army-knife-type wing who can have a positive impact with his feel for the game, his perimeter shooting and his defensive versatility.</p><p>Clifford has looked the part through two games while accumulating 36 points, 16 rebounds, and 8 assists over 54 minutes in a pair of Kings wins.</p><p>The hope in drafting the 23-year-old player is that he'll be ready to contribute from day one. He has demonstrated his ability on and off the ball. He attacks the rim aggressively out of pick-and-rolls and in the open court. And he does the little things he built up a reputation for: going out of his area for rebounds, guarding multiple positions from point guard to power forward, fighting over screens and making simple plays to find teammates for open looks.</p><p>As the first draft pick made by the new <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e266c4ea-9af3-1bd8-06fb-fd608fd30e26\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings\">Sacramento Kings</a> front office led by Scott Perry and B.J. Armstrong, Clifford likely will have every chance to prove he's ready to step into a role early in his NBA career. Nothing he has shown in summer league so far suggests otherwise, especially if the Kings can clear out some of their logjam on the wing. --<em> Jonathan Givony</em></p><hr><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45720296,whitelist-AU|AR|CF|BJ|FM|AM|MZ|TT|BS|VG|SC|BF|LS|NG|SL|AG|EC|LR|NA|MU|MW|CR|MX|SX|GM|GP|GW|BR|NI|BB|GN|NE|GY|UG|GD|SV|ZM|SN|US|AS|GU|MP|PR|VI|UM|GB|UK|CL|PY|ST|CO|GQ|KE|MH|MQ|NZ|VC|AW|TC|CU|CV|MF|BO|BM|CM|KM|BQ|PW|PA|ZW|SR|JM|UY|PE|AI|BZ|BW|MG|CI|SS|GT|TZ|FJ|CG|BI|GA|GF|MS|VE|TG|GH|LC|ER|RW|ET|ML|AO|SZ|HT|CD|KY|ZA|RE|KN|DO|HN|\" data-cerebro-id=\"6871b764f9cb241c51c482e0\" data-title=\"McNeeley, Hornets take down Jazz in first summer league game\" data-source=\"espn\" data-contributing-partner=\"wsc\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0712%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0712%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2Fwsc%2F2025%2F0712%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4%2F3069ff21%2Da095%2D425e%2D981e%2D5936b376f6a4.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45720296\">play</span><figcaption><p>2:04</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>McNeeley, Hornets take down Jazz in first summer league game</p><p>Liam McNeeley and the Hornets come out with a win in their first summer league game over the Jazz.</p></div></div><h2>Notable rookie performances</h2><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/cha.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong><a data-player-guid=\"6d6b4455-4c69-3296-96e1-e20ed80ec16f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5239590/liam-mcneeley\">Liam McNeeley</a> | Forward | <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"377633c2-0dd1-91a1-83c0-9ed2d0c00ea1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets\">Charlotte Hornets</a></strong></p><p>McNeeley scored 22 points with 12 rebounds off the bench in his summer league debut on Friday against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77cea2fb-1388-b7c8-d171-2e72b3aecbfb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/utah/utah-jazz\">Utah Jazz</a>, showing a promising two-way skill set over 28 minutes.

At 6-foot-6 with a quick release and the ability to get his jump shot off against strong contests, his capacity to operate without the ball adds valuable lineup versatility for Miami's coaching staff as his shot creation continues to develop against bigger, longer athletes. His defense likely will play a major part in exactly what kind of role he'll be able to carve out as a rookie, but there was a lot to be encouraged by in his opening performance in Vegas. -- <em>Givony</em></p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/orl.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong><a data-player-guid=\"299c942c-0435-341d-b08e-19d226d035c7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5214637/noah-penda\">Noah Penda</a> | Forward | <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"74c23102-8c27-c8e6-ec1b-8a8fd4d42554\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic</a> </strong></p><p>The Magic traded up to No. 32 early on Day 2 of the draft to take Penda, who averaged 10.2 point per game in France at age 20.

For a team that recently bemoaned its lack of consistency, the group has to be pleased with how it didn't let its foot off the gas facing the six-win Wings. The offensive output was particularly impressive, with 201 points tallied over the past two games. Coach Stephanie White has talked about the importance of stacking games like this, so the test now will be to finish out the pre-All-Star slate strong -- the Fever play at the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"7c72e7ee-5064-b766-2b39-95b57e3d9a08\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/conn/connecticut-sun\">Connecticut Sun</a> on Tuesday and at the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ad8ccde6-59b3-fbe6-2faf-a835fa224ca1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-liberty\">New York Liberty</a> on Wednesday -- and get multiple games above .500 for the first time this season.</p><p><strong>What the game means for the Wings?</strong> The Wings need to figure out their defense. It was tough to watch the way they were constantly beat in transition, particularly in the second quarter, by the Fever offense. Defense has been an Achilles' heel for Dallas this season, but coach Chris Koclanes was hoping his team would come out with more intensity on that end of the floor after giving up big nights to <a data-player-guid=\"c74956ad-2490-b3c4-0cef-485fb49da1a6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/887/sami-whitcomb\">Sami Whitcomb</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"baf2f1cb-234e-740a-0af2-c8a82626b685\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3102133/rebecca-allen\">Rebecca Allen</a>.

Her shooting still isn't quite as efficient as she'd like (4-for-12 from the field,  2-for-7 from 3), but Clark has reiterated that she's trying to stay confident in her abilities and in the work she has put in. Another positive from Sunday: Clark made her presence felt defensively with a team-best five steals.</p><p>Bueckers led all scorers with 21 points on 9-for-15 shooting (2-for-4 from 3), her 17th consecutive game notching double figures to start her career.

Turnovers were a bit of an issue for Bueckers (four, tying her career high) and the rest of the Wings (18), which led to the Fever thriving in transition offense. <em>-- Alexa Philippou</em></p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Live coverage</h2>\n</div></div>"

Since the series started in 2020 until 2023, Allen's place in the quarterback pantheon was universally celebrated among voters inside the league and highlighted in this piece annually. He became, unquestionably, a top-shelf quarterback in the league.</p><p>By the end of the 2023 season, turnovers had started to mount. Allen had thrown 47 interceptions and had fumbled 18 times (seven lost) over a three-year span. That led an NFC executive to criticize Allen as \"overrated,\" to which Buffalo general manager Brandon Beane took exception.</p><blockquote>— Dom Tibbetts (@DomTibbettsTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DomTibbettsTV/status/1816159946171650250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Allen's performance in 2024, however, erased any doubt, with his play applying pressure on Mahomes for the top spot. With nearly 4,300 total yards, 40 touchdowns and six interceptions in 2024, Allen showed what his very best garners: an MVP award and 13 regular-season wins despite the lack of a true No. 1 receiver in his prime.</p><p>\"He's done everything,\" an NFC personnel executive said. \"He's answered every test. He makes less mistakes and takes care of the ball. Only thing left to do is win it all.\"</p><p>Allen epitomizes the modern quarterback, with mobility that can thwart just about any defense, which makes him dangerous in the pocket but even more so out of it.</p><p>Pressure did not affect Allen last season, when he led the NFL in QBR (85.3) and yards per dropback (6.5) under pressure, and his 13 passing touchdowns under duress tied the NFL lead. Allen also had the lowest sack rate in the entire NFL on all dropbacks (2.6%) despite his willingness to stay in the pocket to let plays develop or to buy time and scramble.</p><p>Conversely, Allen's 18.1% off-target rate was the worst clip among the 18 quarterbacks who received at least one vote in this year's top 10.</p><p>\"He's still got that risk-taking to his game and the occasional head-scratching play, but he's taking more calculated risks than wild risks, which is helping his overall play,\" an NFL personnel evaluator said.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/3915511.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false\"></p><h2>3.

His 70.6% completion rate against the backdrop of a league-high 652 attempts in 2024 is impressive. His 11.0% off-target rate is also the lowest among starting quarterbacks.</p><p>\"If we're talking about playing the quarterback position, nobody is playing it better than him,\" a veteran AFC scout said. \"Footwork, ball placement, the mental game at the line of scrimmage, feel for the pocket, eye level, finding creases to step up and throw -- he's the best right now. And he's more mobile than he gets credit for.\"</p><p>Last season, Burrow became the first player in NFL history with 250 passing yards and three passing touchdowns in eight straight games. And similar to Mahomes, he had much to overcome last year.</p><p>\"I get the guy has two elite wideouts, but their run game was average and the offensive line was not very good either,\" an AFC executive said. \"On top of all that, their defense was porous and he kept them in every single game for the most part.

His Total EPA was 160.6, more than 16 points higher than any other quarterback.</p><p>\"Best space runner in the NFL, and he's such a good passer now,\" an NFL defensive coordinator said. \"He probably doesn't get enough credit for how he's improved there.\"</p><p>Years ago, some evaluators knocked Jackson's skills as a pocket passer.

Jackson has ranked in the top five in QBR in each of the past two seasons and has combined for 7,850 passing yards during that span.</p><p>\"I think he had to grow up as a passer,\" a veteran NFL personnel man said. \"He was always more athletic than everyone else, so why not run?

When he's got time [in the pocket], he's as good as almost anybody right now.\"</p><p>Last season, Mayfield joined Brady as the only quarterbacks in Buccaneers history with 40 passing touchdowns in a season. Mayfield dominated against the blitz, leading all quarterbacks in completion percentage (72.3%) and passing touchdowns (18) against five or more pass rushers.</p><p>\"He honestly reminds me of Favre a little bit as far as style of play,\" the personnel man said. \"He's got a moxie to him, like, 'F--- you, I'm on the attack.'

In he charges, mane flowing – if i ever had myself a hairjob, not that I need one of course, I’d totally be googling where he got his, then wearing mine like he wears his. He starts from around to the left-handed Jadeja, angling the ball in to target the stumps; Jadeja takes his fourth-ball single, allowing Stokes two deliveries at Bumrah. The first is just about glanced away, walking across, the second dropped to slip. This is great work from both batters, who might just be bringing the draw back into the equation.</p></article><article id=\"block-687506448f088b778dd2aebe\"><header></header><p><strong>51st over: India 135-8 (Jadeja 36, Bumrah 4) Target</strong> <strong>193 </strong>Carse continues, Jadeja still taking no chances and defending confidently.

He doesn’t, though, get the delivery he’s earmarked to whack, so takes his regular fourth-ball single, this time to mid-off, and given a batter wandering across his stumps, the bowler goes straight; Bumrah does just enough to jam away, then defends the final delivery of the over well enough.</p><p>“If you need something a little coarser to describe the England captain’s ability to turn the tide,” offers Rick Harris, “then I would suggest ‘Stokarse’ as in ‘The match was drifting away from England until the skipper stokarsed them to victory’.

Not yet. Reddy presses to mid-on, whereupon the bowlers lets him know just how much he enjoys his work, then takes a single to short midwicket … which is belatedly called as a no-ball.

He’ll feel a way about being left till last, rightly so, but his chance is coming. Jadeja, though, has decided it’s time to move – he’s looking to score whenever possible now, and he turns to backward square, sprinting one, then, when Reddy looks to turn it into two, he sends him back, in the nick of time. This so intense it reminds me of Glastonbury.</p></article><article id=\"block-6874ec0e8f08755807c83564\"><header></header><p><strong>36th over: India 107-7 (Jadeja 16, Reddy 10) Target</strong> <strong>193 </strong>Having interceded between Carse and Jadeja – imagine that as a square go, goodness me – there’s nowhere safer to kick-off with someone harder than you than on the sports field – begins the 87th over of his spell.

He begins the over with four dots, then natural variation sees one duck in alarmingly; on the balcony, Siraj places hand over mouth, then Jadeja cuts the final delivery of the over uppishly and hard. They run two, the sweeper cutting off the boundary, then batter and bowler exchange sentiments, the former having run into the latter with both watching the fielder. This is on a rolling boil now, and I’d be absolutely buzzing for the fourth Test at OT if I wasn’t using up all my buzz on this one.</p><figure id=\"5e9a6b39-d24e-407d-b232-b5ee1487643e\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-7\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb3813dd2b2817b370316c7b02e1d4514a527d41/0_0_3443_2295/master/3443.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb3813dd2b2817b370316c7b02e1d4514a527d41/0_0_3443_2295/master/3443.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb3813dd2b2817b370316c7b02e1d4514a527d41/0_0_3443_2295/master/3443.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb3813dd2b2817b370316c7b02e1d4514a527d41/0_0_3443_2295/master/3443.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Brydon Carse collides with Ravindra Jadeja.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb3813dd2b2817b370316c7b02e1d4514a527d41/0_0_3443_2295/master/3443.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\" height=\"309.95498112111534\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Brydon Carse collides with Ravindra Jadeja.</span> Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></article><article id=\"block-6874e9a88f08a97237f2e631\"><header></header><p><strong>34th over: India 101-7 (Jadeja 14, Reddy 6) Target</strong> <strong>193 </strong>Is Stokes going to bowl and eighth over?

He puts it from the player’s point of view. I would like to endorse it from the spectator’s point of view. “It is, though, only the rhythms of Test cricket, the ebb and flow, the peculiar challenge offered by the changing conditions over five days and the mental and physical questions that the long game asks of the players that marks cricket out as a special game. Otherwise you might as well watch baseball.’ I agree.”</p><p>I’m certain we all do.

It was also Clark's 17th career 10-assist game, but her first with no more than two turnovers.</p><p>After being sidelined with injuries on two separate occasions this season -- and missing the first Fever-Wings matchup in June -- Clark is still looking to rediscover her typical shooting form. She finished 4-for-12 from the field and 2-for-7 on 3-pointers to score 14 points. But the two-time All-Star was pleased with her facilitating and effort on the defensive end, where she helped set the tone for the Fever and came away with five steals.</p><p>No play got the Fever fans on their feet more than when Clark blocked <a data-player-guid=\"00fd5edf-6b2a-3da4-b07a-13657a4d9afd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4434015/jj-quinerly\">JJ Quinerly</a>'s layup attempt early in the second quarter and then found a rim-running <a data-player-guid=\"a9aee6b9-fc44-8fc7-e1bb-e6dfa6e5f0ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3907781/sophie-cunningham\">Sophie Cunningham</a> with a beautiful three-quarter-court dime.</p><p>\"I still probably didn't shoot it as good as I would have liked, but I feel like it's coming. Just trying to continue to get my legs under me,\" said Clark, who played her third game following a two-week absence. \"I thought my playmaking was really good. There was no reason for me to really shoot that much. ... [We were] just very balanced, and people executed.\"</p><p>Bueckers, the 2025 No. 1 pick, led all scorers with 21 points on 9-for-15 shooting, good for the fourth-longest streak of double-figure scoring to start a WNBA career (17 games). The rookie of the year favorite added 4 assists, 4 rebounds and 2 steals, though she also committed 4 turnovers.</p><p>After a back-and-forth first quarter, the Fever clamped down defensively and demolished the Wings in transition, putting together a 25-4 run and ultimately going into the half up 64-42. The 21 points marked Indiana's best point differential in any quarter since 2016, and the Fever's 64 points were the most any WNBA team has scored in a half this season.</p><p>Indiana shot 52% on the day, scored 23 points off 18 Wings turnovers and tallied a season-high 58 points in the paint.</p><p>\"Some turnovers, and then just their physicality in general got into us,\" Dallas coach Chris Koclanes said of his team's second-quarter collapse. \"Their physicality really, really bothered us in stretches, and kind of took away our flow and continuity. But then again, no excuse for not getting back. I just think we could have had greater effort more consistently in transitions.\"</p><p>The Fever led by as many as 29 in the third quarter and finished with five players in double figures for the fourth time this season, led by a combined 55 points from <a data-player-guid=\"65441aab-bd32-abef-f1f9-6a95b381c955\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3142191/kelsey-mitchell\">Kelsey Mitchell</a> (20), <a data-player-guid=\"2e32f80f-8560-a62e-8654-d21a12d1ed09\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2529130/natasha-howard\">Natasha Howard</a> (18) and <a data-player-guid=\"bcc663d0-9e0f-34d5-8298-d1922f84e7d2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4432831/aliyah-boston\">Aliyah Boston</a> (17).</p><p>\"I think we were just firing on all cylinders, moving the ball well, getting to the next action, playing out a pick and roll well,\" Clark said. \"And then our defense was good and got us a lot of buckets in transition.\"</p><p>Added Indiana coach Stephanie White: \"For us to play in transition, we've got to lock in on the defensive end. And the ball was moving -- we were playing close to .5 basketball in that second quarter.\"</p><p>After a putrid offensive showing on Wednesday in which the Fever (11-10) managed just 61 points with a 30% shooting clip, Indiana has now scored 201 points across its past two games. White said she is \"pleased with our progress\" as the team looks to solidify its identity.</p><p>Dallas (6-16) saw the return Sunday of <a data-player-guid=\"a35875ce-3ef4-61d5-9a20-483b82d82ed9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3904577/arike-ogunbowale\">Arike Ogunbowale</a> from a thumb injury that sidelined her for three contests, but the four-time All-Star struggled to find her shooting stroke. She finished with two points and missed all 10 of her attempts from the field -- the most field goal attempts without a make in her career.</p><p>\"You could tell she hadn't played in a bit. I wish some [shots] would have fallen early for her,\" Koclanes said. \"She's got to continue to find that balance of really working hard to get up the floor and get spots and get off actions, and then I've got to continue to help her.\"</p><p>Added Bueckers: \"This was the best since I've been here that she's responded to [shooting woes]. It might not have been her night shooting the ball, but the way she continued to stay in the game, not let it affect her effort on both ends of the floor, her being a leader of this team, that was huge for me to be able to see that.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

The Jacoby Jones Foundation put on the camp from 2009 to 2015 as a way to give back to the community where Jones grew up.</p><p>Jones, a New Orleans native who won Super Bowl XLVII with the Baltimore Ravens during the 2012 season, died of a heart attack one year ago Monday, shortly after his 40th birthday.</p><p>So on a Saturday in late May, Smith found himself sweating in the New Orleans heat, attempting to corral a group of 317 kids ranging from ages 8-14.</p><p>He gathered them around after an afternoon of football drills in Pontchartrain Park, putting his arm around London-Jones, who spent the day fussing over the children, overseeing breakfast and lunch, handing out free shoes and \"Jacoby Jones football camp\" T-shirts.</p><p>She had a wistful smile on her face as Smith reminded the group to remember why they were there.</p><p>\"This is Miss Emily, aka Mama Jones. We wouldn't be here, literally, if it wasn't for her birthing a legend in Jacoby Jones,\" he said. \"Y'all don't know what she went through for y'all to be here.\"</p><p>Then they broke down the huddle: \"1-2-3, Jacoby!\" They scattered in all directions, still full of energy after five hours of drills.</p><p>That energy was familiar to the group of loved ones who came to celebrate Jones' memory. Pontchartrain Park was where Jones played youth football and is just 15 minutes from the Caesars Superdome, where he won a championship and set an NFL record with a 108-yard Super Bowl kickoff return.</p><p>When his friends and family are at the park now, they remember their Jacoby -- the laughing, dancing, dynamo of energy -- as if he were there himself.</p><p>Friends and family came from all over to honor Jones. Former Ravens teammates Ray Rice and Bryan Hall were among those who agreed to coach, with Smith overseeing the majority of the camp.</p><p>Greg Fassitt, a high school friend of Jones who won a Super Bowl with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"97d2f6c9-2f22-459c-306a-046941ccab2a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-saints\">New Orleans Saints</a> in 2009, attended for the first time, an experience he described as \"bittersweet.\"</p><p>\"It also allows me to really participate in what it means to carry his legacy,\" Fassitt said. \"There's so many kids that, like he and I, that grew up here, ... We didn't grow up having these [opportunities] where somebody could come and tell you, yeah, it's possible, and following the lead.\"</p><p>Jones' cousin Cantrelle Larkins Jr., wore a replica of Jones' high school football jersey, representing the former Marion Abramson High School. Many wore Ravens gear, and at one point during the camp, everyone passed out No. 12 bandanas to the kids, a nod to Jones' signature look in his playing days.</p><p>\"It definitely goes to show the power of a game and a person's heart and energy and love that he gave,\" Smith said. \"Having an impact on so many different people.\"</p><p>Jones is gone, but his mother and family are determined to make sure his kindness and generosity are not forgotten. Jones' acts of selflessness, like when he once took the shoes off his feet to give to someone who didn't have any, are part of that legacy.</p><p>Putting on the free camp was once his way of giving back to his community, and now they want to keep that tradition going.</p><p>\"Whatever it takes not to let his name fade away,\" London-Jones said. \"Because he was good to people. And he loved people. And I want to keep it going.\"</p><p><b>HOW IS JONES</b> most often remembered? It usually starts with the Super Bowl kick return.</p><p>On Feb. 3, 2013, he stood deep in the end zone to receive the second-half kickoff of Super Bowl XLVII for the Ravens. Jones brought the kick out instead of kneeling for the touchback, and by the time he got to the 30-yard line, he had outrun the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"985a261f-296c-c95c-32a5-addc4df75001\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">San Francisco 49ers</a>' coverage.</p><p>Jones ran the final 70 yards by himself, en route to the longest kickoff return in Super Bowl history, which put the Ravens up 28-6. London-Jones was in attendance with Jones' infant son Jacoby Jr., and several members of the extended family.</p><p>\"I was holding little Jacoby when he was running with the ball,\" she said, gesturing a fist punch in the air. \"I was doing this with the baby in my hand. 'Run baby run!' He was always a runner. When he would run, I would run, but I couldn't run because I was holding my grandbaby. ... When he got to the end zone and there were no flags, it was on.\"</p><p>It was a moment made for the movies: New Orleans' own returning to win a championship in his beloved hometown.</p><p>He also made a 56-yard touchdown catch and his 290 all-purpose yards set another Super Bowl record. Jones, who was named to his first Pro Bowl in 2012, helped the Ravens hold off the Niners to win a game also infamous for its 34-minute power outage.</p><p>Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome once credited Jones for the championship, saying, \"We don't win Super Bowl XLVII without Jacoby.\"</p><p>Jones was also a critical piece of getting the Ravens to the Super Bowl at all. In the AFC divisional round of the playoffs, he caught a 70-yard touchdown from quarterback <a data-player-guid=\"cfd567df-191e-29cf-0dc6-0bcf84085135\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco\">Joe Flacco</a> with 41 seconds left in regulation, sending the game into double overtime, where the Ravens beat the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"51042145-e3c1-0694-ae0d-f720342ff8fc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a>.</p><p>The following week they beat the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0078f353-fe3e-67ed-a42c-43cca0568e21\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots</a> in the AFC Championship Game to clinch their trip to New Orleans.</p><p>Rice recalled that Jones, who caught two passes against the Broncos, had dropped a pass earlier in the game, prompting linebacker Ray Lewis to take him aside and assure him the ball would come back to him.</p><p>\"And look at it,\" Rice said. \"We needed him in the most clutch moment ever, and you could ride that off there because ... nobody was going to beat us after those moments. I think destiny was on our side that year.\"</p><p>Lewis would also give Jones a pep talk in the Super Bowl, walking up to him before the start of the second half to predict a big return.</p><p>\"Ray's kind of a larger-than-life personality. Jacoby then jogs out and he returns the kickoff,\" former Ravens tight end Dennis Pitta said. \"But it was incredible. And Ray kind of spoke it into existence. Jacoby with his speed and vision on that play obviously made it happen. But what a huge play.\"</p><p>The power went out three plays after Jones' touchdown, and the Niners scored two unanswered touchdowns in the third quarter before the Ravens recovered, fending them off with an intentional safety to run the clock out. Although Flacco was named the MVP, Jones stole the show.</p><p>\"I don't think anybody in Baltimore will ever forget how his play made them feel,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"Watching him play that kickoff return in the Super Bowl or the long receiving touchdown where he juked out like two dudes at the 5-yard line and skates himself into the end zone. And that's just [in] a Super Bowl.\"</p><p>When the game was over, Jones brought his family down to the field, holding his son in his arms for postgame interviews. When he was free of his obligations, he burst into the Ravens' postgame locker room yelling and bouncing around so enthusiastically that he burst a blood vessel in his eye.</p><p>\"You ask anybody who's encountered, it's the spirit, the mindset, the energy, always positive. So it was beautiful to see that story come full circle,\" Fassitt said. \"The Denver game and the most 'unlikely' person each time. So I think that's a beautiful thing, part of his legacy that I'll always remember, the same person from high school through long after.\"</p><p><b>JONES' SUPER BOWL</b> heroics catapulted him into brief stardom.</p><p>He threw out first pitches and was given the honor of riding a Mardi Gras float along with Ravens safety Ed Reed, also a New Orleans native.</p><p>He placed third on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" where he showed off a love of dancing that dated back to his childhood.</p><p>People lined the streets early in the morning on Fat Tuesday to celebrate life and the local players, and with every corner the float turned, London-Jones could hear the chants get louder: \"M-V-P. M-V-P. M-V-P.\"</p><p>\"That's all you could hear,\" said London-Jones, who also rode on the float. \"I had chills just going through my body. ... They were screaming out his name, chanting. Of course, he was dancing on the float. Oh, bet you knew he was going to dance. That was a crazy exciting time.\"</p><p>But her favorite moments from those whirlwind days came in the lead-up to the game itself, when she cooked for more than 100 members of the Ravens' roster and staff.</p><p>The tables were filled with the weight of the lemon pepper chicken, potato salad and bread pudding. There was gumbo and jambalaya and -- of course -- Jones' favorite seven-cheese macaroni.</p><p>Everybody kept coming back for more, getting seconds and thirds until the entire spread was wiped out.</p><p>She loved those days -- cheering him on from her end zone seats, where she'd whistle to let him know her location. If he scored on that side of the stadium, it was his mother who he'd run to first.</p><p>Once, in the final minutes of a 2013 game against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"3db556c9-ed76-a7a5-4ccb-a92fc6db4334\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Minnesota Vikings</a>, Jones was set to receive a punt but was chatting with his mom just seconds before the kick.</p><p>\"He is talking to Ms. Emily in the end zone,\" Harbaugh recalled. \"I am screaming: 'Jacoby, Jacoby, Jacoby!' He kind of looks back and goes, 'Oh, I guess we have to go.' He turns around on the dead run and sprints as the kicker is kicking the ball; he is sprinting from the end zone, catches it on the dead run and takes it to the house for the [77-yard] touchdown.\"</p><p>London-Jones missed only one of his games -- 2013 against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"19d73366-b5a5-cca2-a176-a2c024ce0bb3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Chicago Bears</a> -- when she was in the hospital. She was still prepared to get up and walk out, determined to fly to her son, but the doctors stood their ground.</p><p>\"They did put me in ICU so I wouldn't leave. They didn't release me until Sunday after halftime,\" she said.</p><p>London-Jones and her son both got tattoos after the Super Bowl win -- her first, and one of many for Jones, who already had tattoos of New Orleans on his body.</p><p>He had one on his stomach to replace the photos of his grandparents washed away in Hurricane Katrina, another on his back with the address of the house he was raised in, the outline of the Superdome -- later complete with the Ravens logo and the Lombardi Trophy.</p><p>Jones played two more seasons with Baltimore before being released in 2015, but he retired as a Raven after signing a one-day contract in September 2017.</p><p>\"Jacoby, in the biggest game on the biggest stage, had his best game in his hometown,\" Newsome said upon Jones' retirement. \"And that is surreal.\"</p><p>When Jones retired, he bought a house in New Orleans right next to his mother, preparing both of them for the next phase of his life.</p><p>He coached wide receivers at Lane College, tight ends at Morgan State and most recently wide receivers at Alabama State. Before his death, he accepted a job as head coach of the Beaumont Renegades, an indoor football team that won the National Arena League title in its sole season of participation this year.</p><p>London-Jones said he had a \"phenomenal gift\" for coaching, teaching through his actions instead of yelling. At his funeral, one former teammate told London-Jones that, \"Jacoby would bring a locker room to be as one.\"</p><p>\"He just brought kind of a happiness and a light to everybody around him and everybody fed off that, and he was liked by everyone,\" Pitta said.</p><p><b>JONES' PRESENCE STILL </b> lingers in Pontchartrain Park.</p><p>When he died, a mural was painted in his honor on one of the buildings in the park, allowing Jones to watch over the next generation of kids.</p><p>On the day of his camp, one woman took a picture with the mural, explaining that she'd driven her children two hours for the opportunity to participate.</p><p>Another man, Eric Bridges, proudly displayed the Most Valuable Player trophy that he once won when he was a camper. That day, Bridges was there with his teenage son, who has his own dreams of playing football one day.</p><p>\"I signed him up as soon as I saw it,\" Bridges said. \"I used to always tell them, bro, you go to camps and this is what you learn. You can learn a lot of stuff. You meet a lot of different players that you didn't know. I met the first NFL players I ever met in my life, coming to this camp.\"</p><p>Perhaps the next Jacoby Jones was in attendance that day in May. If that turns out to be the case, Hall, and Jones' other friends, want to be there to witness it.</p><p>\"Losing him last year was a shock to a lot of us, and we're just out here honoring his name and it feels good to be out here to honor what he did,\" Hall said. \"He started as a kid like this. So we want to make sure there are opportunities for the same kids, because there's another Jacoby Jones out here and we want to make sure he gets that opportunity.\"</p><p><em>Ravens reporter Jamison Hensley contributed to this story. </em></p>\n</div></div>"

So, keep an eye on <strong>Tadej Pogačar </strong>(<strong>UAE Team Emirates-XRG</strong>) – the current yellow jersey leader – and his main rival <strong>Jonas Vingegaard </strong>(<strong>Visma-Lease a Bike</strong>), who took a suprise stage win the last time the Tour came to the <strong>Massif Central</strong>. But <strong>Remco Evenepoel</strong> (<strong>Soudal-Quickstep</strong>) is second placed in the GC at the moment, so is also one to watch. And don’t foget the French rider in the peloton, such as <strong>Julian Alaphilippe </strong>(<strong>Tudor Pro Cycling</strong>) and<strong> Romain Grégoire </strong>(Groupama-FDJ), who would love to be in the action on Bastille Day.</p>&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;da03d59e-acac-47cd-a3e1-0fa6c9a23c2b&quot;},{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>Before

of the Tour de France [is] Ennezat to le Mont-Dore Puy de Sancy, 165km, with a total of 4,450m of elevation gain. All day long, the riders will face a relentless series of climbs and mountain passes. Including, for example, Croix Saint-Morrand and the Croix de Saint-Robert.</p>\n <p>We’ve made the most of the climbs available in the Puy de Dôme region, and the route even skirts around the Puy de Dôme itself. Only those in peak condition will hope to shine on a course like this.</p>\n <p>The finish is at the summit of the Puy de Sancy, a final climb of more than 3km at an 8% average gradient, very straight, very wide – it’s easy to lose your bearings on a climb like this, and we might see quite a few riders crack.

After that, there’ll be no respite until the final climb to the resort of Le Mont-Dore.

France’s national day and an opportunity for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Tour de France</a> riders to put on a show for the crowds of fans expected to line today’s route. The peloton have <strong>165.3km</strong> to cover in this <strong>mountain stage</strong> from <strong>Ennezat</strong> to <strong>Le Mont-Dore Puy de Sancy</strong> – the last before a rest day tomorrow – and will face <strong>seven category two climbs</strong> and <strong>one category three climb</strong>. In total, the riders have <strong>4,450m of elevation</strong> on the cards. There’s also and <strong>intermediate sprint at 44km</strong> in.</p><p>It’s going to be a hard day at the end of a long first week for the peloton. It’s expected that the route and profile of today’s stage will bring the GC contenders to the fore and be a test to see who’s serious about the maillot jaune and who’s falling short. So, keep an eye on <strong>Tadej Pogačar </strong>(<strong>UAE Team Emirates-XRG</strong>) – the current yellow jersey leader – and his main rival <strong>Jonas Vingegaard </strong>(<strong>Visma-Lease a Bike</strong>), who took a suprise stage win the last time the Tour came to the <strong>Massif Central</strong>. But <strong>Remco Evenepoel</strong> (<strong>Soudal-Quickstep</strong>) is second placed in the GC at the moment, so is also one to watch. And don’t foget the French rider in the peloton, such as <strong>Julian Alaphilippe </strong>(<strong>Tudor Pro Cycling</strong>) and<strong> Romain Grégoire </strong>(Groupama-FDJ), who would love to be in the action on Bastille Day.</p><p>Before the action starts at <strong>1.10pm CEST (12.10am BST)</strong>, here’s a recap of yesterday’s stage:</p><figure id=\"72d1a75f-630e-42ee-abf6-a09b5a07b15a\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Tour de France 2025: Tim Merlier claims stage nine as Van der Poel bid falls short&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;72d1a75f-630e-42ee-abf6-a09b5a07b15a&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;inline&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/13/tour-de-france-2025-tim-merlier-edges-out-jonathan-milan-to-win-stage-nine&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:11,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure></article><gu-island name=\"LiveBlogEpic\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;sectionId&quot;:&quot;sport&quot;,&quot;shouldHideReaderRevenue&quot;:false,&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sport/tour-de-france-2025&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Keyword&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Tour de France 2025&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sport/tourdefrance&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Keyword&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Tour de France&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sport/cycling&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Keyword&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cycling&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sport/sport&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Keyword&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Sport&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;type/article&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Type&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Article&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;tone/minutebyminute&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Tone&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Minute by minute&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;tone/news&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Tone&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;News&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;profile/ami-sedghi&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Contributor&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Amy Sedghi&quot;,&quot;bylineImageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/9/29/1285761333697/Ami-Sedghi-byline-pic-002.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=99cdf272f5468af41ef49de23f0a6848&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-sport&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Tracking&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;UK Sport&quot;}],&quot;isPaidContent&quot;:false,&quot;contributionsServiceUrl&quot;:&quot;https://contributions.guardianapis.com&quot;,&quot;pageId&quot;:&quot;sport/live/2025/jul/14/tour-de-france-2025-stage-10-from-ennezat-to-mont-dore-puy-de-sancy-live&quot;,&quot;keywordIds&quot;:&quot;sport/tour-de-france-2025,sport/tourdefrance,sport/cycling,sport/sport&quot;,&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}\"></gu-island></div></div>"

Seattle was the other team taking a long look at Hernandez, but the shenanigans at the top two picks (more on that later) means that both Seattle and Pittsburgh got their preferred arms.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/oak.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>A's select Arnold and Taylor</strong></p><p>The Athletics had only two picks on Day 1 but received excellent values at each. Jamie Arnold was the top prospect in the draft entering the season and seemed primed to go somewhere between No. 2 and No. 8 after an uneven season. He somehow was the prospect left holding the short straw, falling to the 11th pick. Devin Taylor was in the mix at multiple picks in the comp round but lasted five selections into the second round.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/min.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Twins embrace risk with Quick and Young</strong></p><p>The Twins took two hit-first college infielders as their first picks last year (Kaelen Culpepper and Kyle DeBarge), took another one in the 2023 second round (Luke Keaschall), and two more in the top two rounds in 2022 (Brooks Lee, Tanner Schobel) -- and also took one with their first pick this year in Marek Houston.</p><p>What interested me though is what Minnesota did after that, taking big swings with the upside of Riley Quick (four potential plus pitches but below-average command) and Quentin Young (80-grade power potential with big questions on contact rate).</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/phi.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Phillies try to jump the reliever trade market?</strong></p><p>Gage Wood has a chance to start long term but can also go straight to the upper minors -- if not the big leagues -- and potentially help the bullpen later this season, like a trade deadline addition. The Phillies' next pick, Cade Obermueller, is another possible starter who also could move quickly as a lefty turning 22 later this month with two knockout pitches in his fastball/slider combo. Odds are good that at least one of them can provide big league value in the next 12 months if Philly wants to utilize them that way.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bos.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>The Red Sox land Witherspoon, Phillips and Eyanson</strong></p><p>The Red Sox are interested in creating more pitching depth and selected a number of interesting arms on Day 1. Kyson Witherspoon had a lot of interest in the top 10, but the Red Sox got him at No. 15.</p><p>He'll need to sharpen his execution a notch and his short arm action is unique, but there's midrotation upside. Marcus Phillips has a chance to start but could also bring another distinctive look as a late-inning arm with four plus pitches from a low slot and a triple-digit fastball. Anthony Eyanson is a different sort, with fringy fastball velocity but standout command along with a slider and splitter that keep hitters off-balance.</p><h2><strong>Five eye-openers</strong></h2><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/wsh.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Eli Willits at No. 1</strong></p><p>The buzz ahead of the draft was that there were three players in play for the top pick and Willits was my third-ranked player in the class, so the same group is what I would've been considering -- and I love Willits as a player. The bonus will be a factor in evaluating how successful this pick will be viewed -- I'll guess it starts with an eight -- but I think this will be seen as a solid decision, as long as Kade Anderson or Ethan Holliday don't become stars.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Tyler Bremner at No. 2</strong></p><p>The biggest piece of late buzz I was hearing is that Bremner was in play at No. 3 to the Mariners. I didn't hear his name at all at No. 2 so that made this pick the first shocker in the draft.</p><p>Bremner was considered in this area (on a deal) because he could easily be the best pitcher in this class -- but only if he can develop a better slider, which isn't a small if. The Angels seem to have a thought about how to solve this, and how he progresses will be one of the more followed storylines of this draft.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/det.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Tigers take Yost and Oliveto</strong></p><p>I like both players, but it's fascinating that these two and the most-rumored prep hitter tied to Detroit that they didn't take (Coy James, who had a tough summer) were all missing strong 2024 summer performances.</p><p>Jordan Yost and Michael Oliveto were the only two prep position players in the first-round mix who weren't in the major national events on the summer circuit, thus creating a lot of uncertainty about how to project them.</p><p>The Tigers are right to assume this could create a potential quick gain in value if Yost and Oliveto can perform early in their pro careers, but I don't remember seeing a team double down on lack of summer exposure in the early rounds.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bal.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Orioles take two catchers in the first round, and two pitchers in the second</strong></p><p>It's certainly a bit odd that the Orioles took two college catchers with their first two picks after taking another one (Ethan Anderson) in the second round last year. Obviously, teams don't draft for big league need -- the O's already have Adley Rutschman -- and they need at least two catchers at all four full season minor league affiliates, it's just odd to see them invest in this position early multiple times. And after all of the position players they have drafted under Mike Elias, they did sneak in two arms on Day 1 with Joseph Dzierwa (a command-forward lefty) and J.T. Quinn (one of my favorite college relievers with the traits to start in pro ball).</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cle.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Guardians lean into power</strong></p><p>The Guardians often draft, or sign internationally, hit-first players who are often underpowered, with Steven Kwan a prominent example. They swerved a lot this year, taking Jace LaViolette with their first pick (I compare him to Cody Bellinger or Joey Gallo; he hit .258 this season) and Nolan Schubart (24% strikeout rate, 22% in-zone whiff rate) with their fifth pick on Day 1. Those two have big power and strong pull/lift rates, and LaViolette has the athleticism to play center field, so there's real talent, it's just not usually the type that the Guardians have targeted.</p><hr><h2>Best available for Day 2</h2><p><em>Listed by top 250 draft rankings </em></p><p>43.

He then scuffled to begin the season, exiting March with a 4.24 ERA that represented the highest in the Gauchos rotation. Bremner rebounded from there, notching 10 or more strikeouts in six of his final seven starts. (Notably, he had not punched out double digit batters in any appearance prior to April 4.)

What more do you need to know? Maybe that he possesses a low-90s fastball, two breaking balls (including a harder slider), and a changeup that generated ample whiffs against right-handed batters. And possibly that he's also shown good control over his pitches, averaging fewer than two walks per appearance. It's a strong year for collegiate lefties at the top of the draft, but Anderson might be the safest of the bunch.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/alt/318.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/\">\n                            Rockies\n                    </a>\n    </p></div>\n    </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"> \t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ethan Holliday, 3B/SS, Stillwater HS (OK):</strong> The most famous player in this year's draft.

Holliday is likely to end up at third base before all is said and done, but the real selling point here is and will remain his bat. He's a lefty hitter with a good approach and big-time strength, giving him the kind of on-base and slugging capacity that could entrench him in the middle of an order. Scouts do still have concerns about his contact chops, but they were encouraged by his decision to add a toe tap to his operation this spring and believe he'll work to get the most from his talent. \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/alt/328.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/\">\n                            Cardinals\n                    </a>\n    </p></div>\n    </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">\t\t\t\t<strong>Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee</strong>: Doyle was the breakout star of the college baseball season, hanging his star at the onset by striking out 47 batters in his first 20-plus innings. He didn't maintain that pace the rest of the way (how could he?), but he did lead the country in strikeout rate (42.6%). Doyle may find himself under the microscope for a few reasons. Foremost, he rode his mid-90s fastball so hard that his usage rate would've been highest among qualified MLB starting pitchers. Of course, it's hard to knock him for embracing what proved to be a winning strategy, and to his credit he did show enough promise with his other pitches (including a slider and change) that this may prove to be a non-factor.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-pirates/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/alt/325.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-pirates/\">\n                            Pirates\n                    </a>\n    </p></div>\n    </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">\t\t\t\t<strong>Seth Hernandez, RHP, Corona HS (CA)</strong>: Hernandez is arguably the most polarizing player in the class because of the clash between the macro and the micro. Empirically, prep right-handers are a terrible bet to make in the early stages of the draft. Is it fair to hold someone else's history against Hernandez? That's where opinions may differ. If you're just weighing him on his own merits, he's a physical, live-armed righty with a good changeup and a feel for spin. You can envision this working, and possibly working out well -- you just have to block out the howls of failures past to do it.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/alt/319.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">\n                            Marlins\n                    </a>\n    </p></div>\n    </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">\t\t\t\t<strong>Aiva Arquette, SS, Oregon State</strong>: Precedent says someone of Arquette's size will end up moving off shortstop.

He posted a higher OPS in SEC play (1.332) than outside of it, all while homering 18 times, swiping 11 bases, and continuing to employ an all-fields approach.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/alt/308.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <div>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">\n                            Brewers\n                    </a>\n    </p></div>\n    </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">\t\t\t\t<strong>Andrew Fischer, 3B, Tennessee</strong>: Fischer was a multi-time transfer who also logged innings at Duke and Ole Miss.

Facing <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a> at the Parc des Princes, they found themselves two goals down in the second half and stormed back to win 4-2. Had they not turned it around, they would have been eliminated. Instead, they went on a tear that saw them win 17 of their next 19 games as coach Luis Enrique turned them into a near-flawless football machine, clinching a domestic treble and a first-ever <a data-league-guid=\"da52796f-2621-3351-8e77-955da92ea82d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/UEFA.CHAMPIONS\">UEFA Champions League</a> title.</p><p>Luis Enrique has often praised his players for the reaction they showed in adversity and their ability to react. You can be certain he was hoping for the same when <a data-player-guid=\"6db4c779-7f2c-07f7-14ce-64d74f7d7fad\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/217092/cole-palmer\">Cole Palmer</a>'s one-two punch gave <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c43a00b9-2826-72b3-77a0-62730abc936e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=363\">Chelsea</a> a two-goal lead at the half-hour mark on Sunday.</p><p>Except ... the comeback never came, and the question he and his staff will be wondering is what they could have done differently.</p><p>As ever, there's more than one answer. You can pinpoint individual breaks -- the ball sitting up for <a data-player-guid=\"079b587a-173f-3a77-98b2-60f43628ef68\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/308947/malo-gusto\">Malo Gusto</a> after his blocked finish -- and individual errors - <a data-player-guid=\"bcd38483-c60b-0252-80d5-14eb40d25155\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/217092/nuno-mendes\">Nuno Mendes</a> getting shoved off the ball, <a data-player-guid=\"a1cf7fd7-1110-341d-ad03-f44c09ae2bb5\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/217092/desire-doue\">Désiré Doué</a> opting not to shoot, <a data-player-guid=\"025e47e3-91a4-3a04-bd98-66fca18c9a04\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/159047/vitinha\">Vitinha</a> biting on Palmer's body fake -- to explain the 3-0 halftime deficit. And you'd be right.</p><p>A more thorough reading, though, would suggest PSG didn't react because Chelsea did not allow them to. Enzo Maresca's crew came out of the box with an unusual combination of rabid intensity and tactical <em>savoir faire</em> -- witness the role <a data-player-guid=\"b89d5b36-af9b-ee96-1d95-3dcb40636b86\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/189007/reece-james\">Reece James</a> played in helping to blunt the previously near unplayable Nuno Mendes-Khvicha Kvaratskhelia chain down the right. Doubling up the moment any guy in a white shirt got the ball (other than the two center backs, who did not present much of a footballing threat) isn't the sort of thing you can keep up for 90 minutes, but Chelsea didn't need to.</p><p>(Maresca himself, after the game, said: \"We held that intensity for as long as we could, maybe 35 minutes, but it turned out to be enough to win the match because by that stage we were 2-0 up.\")</p><p>Sunday's final left PSG -- and maybe Luis Enrique himself -- stunned. This is usually what his players do to opponents, not the other way around. And it's risky, too, because one misread trigger and the press is broken, leaving you to face Desire Doue, <a data-player-guid=\"5c936c66-707c-6b18-bbef-6214d951771d\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/217092/ousmane-dembele\">Ousmane Dembélé</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"5c8662cd-474c-892f-369c-15544105fe99\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/159047/achraf-hakimi\">Achraf Hakimi</a> in full flight. Chelsea had the athleticism to do this. Most PSG opponents won't.</p><p>In that sense, Luis Enrique shouldn't fret. They were beaten by an opponent who matches up unusually well against them, and it could have gone the other way. But equally, this is the sort of beatdown that sows doubt.</p><p>Maybe Vitinha &amp; Co. aren't as press-resistant as we thought. Maybe the old Dembélé -- the one who, on his worse days, is far from being a Ballon d'Or candidate and looks more like the player who used to haunt the Camp Nou without purpose -- hasn't been thoroughly banished. Maybe sometimes it's not a bad thing to have a center forward who can play with his back to goal. Maybe Luis Enrique, for all his wisdom, should have done a better job at reading what Chelsea were doing to PSG in the first half-hour and found the countermeasures.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45735236\" data-cerebro-id=\"687438bcf9cb241c51c4fe97\" data-title=\"FC crew slam 'unacceptable' outburst from Enrique after Club World Cup final\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0713%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134%2Fdm_250713_COM_SOC_Analysis_FC_crew_slam_E28098unac1134.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45735236\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:30</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>FC crew slam 'unacceptable' outburst from Enrique after Club World Cup final</p><p>The ESPN FC crew react to the scenes between Luis Enrique and the Chelsea squad after the Club World Cup final.</p></div></div><p>This will be an interesting summer for PSG.

So they should and will be very proud if they could hear what all his teammates and all the staff members would say about him.</p><p>\"Second of all, I think our fans can be so proud about the players we have at this club.</p><p>\"They've seen them winning the league, that was a great achievement, but what they did in the last week with the togetherness they had, how they conducted themselves when we were in Portugal together, the fans couldn't have asked for more from our players when it comes to how great human beings they are.</p><p>\"Those are the two emotions. Of course, the first emotion of sadness is much stronger than the one of being proud. But it's the both of them.\"</p><p>Slot emphasised the need for his players feel what it is like to play football again as the players and staff continue to process their grief.</p><p>\"Nothing seems to be important if we think of what has happened. But we are a football club and we need to train and we need to play again, if we want it or not,\" Slot said.</p><p>\"What I've said to the players, I can say it here as well. It's very difficult to find the right words because we constantly debate what is appropriate. What is appropriate in our actions? What is appropriate [for] what we have to say? Can we train again? Can we laugh again? Can we be angry if there's a wrong decision?</p><p>\"And I've said to them, 'maybe the best thing for us to do is handle this situation like Jota was.' And what I meant with that is that Jota was always himself, it didn't matter if he was talking to me, to his teammates, to the staff, he was always himself. So let us try to be ourselves as well. So, if we want to laugh we laugh; if we want to cry we're going to cry. If they want to train they can train, if they don't want to train they can not train. But be yourself, don't think you have to be different than your emotions tell you.\"</p><p>\"Second of all, Jots was the player that if things were really, really, really difficult, I always looked at him and said, 'Now we need something special from you.' And he delivered so many times in those moments. I can come up with all of these moments, even before I was here he had many of these moments as well. So we are in a very difficult time, so let's try to do what Diogo did so many times. If it's so difficult then try a little bit harder or just keep on going and try to make it work.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div>\n        \n        \n                            \n                \n        <p>Not many teams across sports have enjoyed the level of talent that the Pittsburgh Steelers have had since the turn of the century. Over that time, that talent has helped Pittsburgh win two Super Bowls, three AFC Championships and 10 division titles. It's also allowed the Steelers to go a record 21 consecutive seasons without a losing record.&nbsp;</p><p>While \"Steel Curtain\" legend Joe Greene is considered the greatest player in franchise history, an argument can be made as to who is the franchise's best player this century. That question was the inspiration behind the following ranking of the franchise's 10 best players since 2000.&nbsp;</p><p>Before reading the list, it's important to note that the three players who made the cut whose Steelers careers began before 2000 were judged only by what they accomplished this century. It's also worth noting that this list is a ranking of the best players who have worn the black and gold since 2000 and not simply a ranking of the most impactful Steelers of the past quarter century.&nbsp;</p><p>Without further ado, let's take a look at the list, starting with the franchise's best players who missed the cut but deserve mention nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Honorable mentions</strong></p><ul><li>TE&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/416861/heath-miller/\">Heath Miller</a><br></li><li>DE&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26726496/aaron-smith/\">Aaron Smith</a><br></li><li>NT Casey Hampton<br></li><li>LB Joey Porter<br></li><li>RB&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1751828/leveon-bell/\">Le'Veon Bell</a><br></li><li>RB Willie Parker<br></li><li>LB James Farrior<br></li><li>S&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186316/minkah-fitzpatrick/\">Minkah Fitzpatrick</a>&nbsp;<br></li></ul><h2>10. Jerome Bettis, RB (1996-05)</h2><p>Bettis' best years with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> were in the 1990s, but he still did enough during the 2000s to earn a spot on this list. His 5,199 rushing yards this century is the third-most by a Steelers player, just behind Willie Parker (5,378 yards) and Le'Veon Bell (5,336 yards).&nbsp;</p><p>During that span, Bettis earned two of his six Pro Bowl selections. In 2001, Bettis was in the midst of arguably his best season before an injury sidelined him for Pittsburgh's final five games. Three years later, Bettis came off the bench to help lead the Steelers to a 15-1 regular season record. He earned his sixth and final Pro Bowl nod that year and finished fourth in the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> Comeback Player of the Year voting.&nbsp;</p><p>Bettis retired after helping the Steelers win their first <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> in 26 years following Pittsburgh's win over Seattle in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> XL. While he was playing behind Parker at this point, Bettis still proved his value as an effective goal-line and short-yardage back. Bettis also showed in Week 14 that he still had another vintage game left in him after he rushed for 101 yards in Pittsburgh's win over Chicago. That win propelled the Steelers on an eight-game winning streak.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"The Bus\" earned a permanent parking spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015.&nbsp;</p><h2>9. Cameron Heyward, DT (2011-present)</h2><p>After largely flying under the radar during the first half of his career, Heyward has since established himself as a perennial Pro Bowler and a potential future Hall of Famer.&nbsp;</p><p>A 2011 first-round pick, Heyward didn't become a starter until his third season. By his second season as a stater, Heyward established himself as a highly productive player who could make an impact as both a pass rusher and a run-stuffer.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Since 2017, Heyward has been named to seven Pro Bowls and has been tabbed as an All-Pro four times. In 2024, Heyward returned from a nagging injury to once again earn All-Pro honors while finishing second on the team in sacks. At 35, Heyward joined Roethlisberger (in 2017) as the oldest players in franchise history to earn Pro Bowl recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>Only eight Steelers in the team history have more Pro Bowl selections than Heyward, whose 211 regular season games as a Steeler is the fourth-highest total in franchise history. His 88.5 career sacks is second to only T.J. Watt on the franchise career list.&nbsp;</p><h2>8. Maurkice Pouncey, C (2010-20)</h2><p>Despite suffering two major injuries, Pouncey carved out a Hall of Fame worthy career. In nine full seasons, Pouncey earned nine Pro Bowl nods, was a two-time All-Pro and a member of the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> All-Decade Team for the 2010s. Joe Greene is the only Steelers player with more Pro Bowl selections than Pouncey.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>An immediate starter in Pittsburgh, Pouncey played a key role that season in helping the Steelers win the AFC (he missed the team's Super Bowl loss to the Packers after getting hurt in the AFC title game). Over the next decade, Pouncey helped provide Ben Roethlisberger with excellent protection while helping him solidify his status as a future Hall of Famer. Pouncey also blocked for two 1,000-yard backs and two Pro Bowlers in Le'Veon Bell and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071585/james-conner/\">James Conner</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>During the mid 2010s, Pouncey was the leader of a talented offensive line that also featured fellow Pro Bowlers <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1631907/david-decastro/\">David DeCastro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2129295/alejandro-villanueva/\">Alejandro Villanueva</a>. Together, the unit helped Roethlisberger, Bell and Antonio Brown become the most feared offensive trio in the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. The line played an integral role in the Steelers' most recent AFC Championship game appearance, which occurred at the end of the 2016 season.&nbsp;</p><h2>7. Antonio Brown, WR (2010-18)&nbsp;</h2><p>There aren't many players in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history who can rival the six-year run that Brown enjoyed from 2013-18. During that span, Brown earned six of his seven career Pro Bowl nods while becoming arguably the game's best offensive weapon not named <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187741/tom-brady/\">Tom Brady</a>. &nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>During that span, Brown led the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in receptions and receiving yards on multiple occasions. He also led the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> touchdown catches once. During those six seasons, Brown averaged 114 catches, 1,524 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns per season. His best season was in 2015, when he set franchise records with 136 receptions for 1,834 yards. Brown set a franchise single-game record that season when <a href=\"https://x.com/SteelersNetwork/status/1689801116794642432\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">he went off for 284 yards</a> during a win over the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a>. Brown's success that season was more impressive when you consider that Ben Roethlisberger missed four games and parts of four others due to injury.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, Brown further etched his name into Steelers lore with <a href=\"https://x.com/Athletiverse/status/1738945259600576728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">his \"Immaculate Extension\" touchdown</a> on Christmas Day that propelled the Steelers to a division-clinching win over the Ravens. A year later, Brown was among the frontrunners for league MVP before an injury sidelined him for the final 2.5 games of the regular season.&nbsp;</p><p>While he is second to Ward in most franchise career rankings, Brown does hold the four-highest single-season receiving seasons in Steelers history. His time in Pittsburgh also concludes <a href=\"https://x.com/sdextrasmedia/status/1322319958655737856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">his helmet grab</a> that helped the Steelers defeat the Ravens in the 2010 divisional round. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>6. James Harrison, OLB (2002, 2004-12, 2014-17)&nbsp;</h2><p>Harrison's unique career includes being the only undrafted rookie to win NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Harrison, who won the award in 2008, enjoyed a borderline <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> career despite not becoming a starter until the age of 29.&nbsp;</p><p>Harrison -- who didn't become a full-time NFL player until age 26 -- quickly made up for his humble NFL beginnings, starting in 2007, his first year as a starter. Harrison <a href=\"https://x.com/NFLLegacy/status/1124846846659063808\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">had his coming out party</a> that season against the Ravens, recording 10 tackles, six quarterback hits, 3.5 sacks, three forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and an interception. That season was the first of five consecutive Pro Bowl campaigns for Harrison, who during that time was considered the NFL's most intimidating player.&nbsp;</p><p>Harrison's 2008 season was one for the ages. In 15 games, Harrison posted 101 tackles, a then-franchise record 16 sacks, a league-high seven forced fumbles and an interception. Harrison capped off his DPOY season with a <a href=\"https://x.com/TheStandard412/status/1942289984934785260\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">100-yard pick-six</a> in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> XLIII.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Over the next three years, Harrison continued to be recognized as one of the NFL's premier pass rushers. In 2014, Harrison returned to Pittsburgh (following a brief retirement) and embraced his role as a backup. While his snaps were limited, Harrison continued to excel at getting to the quarterback. He had two sacks during the 2015 playoffs and 2.5 sacks and a forced fumble during the 2016 postseason. That was also the year Harrison became the Steelers' franchise career sack leader.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2024, Harrison joined several of his former teammates when he was inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Hines Ward, WR (1998-11)&nbsp;</h2><p>Ward is ranked ahead of fellow wideout Antonio Brown because he is the Steelers' career leader in catches, receiving yards and touchdown receptions and is also a two-time <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champion and a former <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> MVP.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Along with putting up numbers, Ward -- a four-time Pro Bowler and three-time second-team All-Pro -- is also arguably the best blocking receiver in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history. His <a href=\"https://x.com/ItzYinzburgh/status/1029760459707174912\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">crushing hit</a> on then-Bengals linebacker <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1369410/keith-rivers/\">Keith Rivers</a> in 2008 led to the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> creating a rule to better protect players who are deemed defenseless.&nbsp;</p><p>Ward's signature moment was his MVP performance in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> XL. He caught five passes for 123 yards that included a 37-yard catch (on a third-and-28 play) that helped set up Pittsburgh's first touchdown. His <a href=\"https://x.com/KevG163/status/1754570528772194774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">43-yard touchdown catch</a> midway through the fourth quarter sealed the win.&nbsp;</p><p>In many ways, Ward's performance that night was a microcosm of his postseason career. In 2002, Ward led all postseason receivers with 18 receptions and three touchdowns despite the Steelers losing in the divisional round. In 2005, Ward caught three touchdowns, the most by any player that postseason.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Ward's 88 career playoff catches is tied for the seventh-most in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history. He is 10th in career postseason receiving yards (1,181) and is tied for fifth in career playoff touchdown catches (10).&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all of his success, Ward is part of the backlog of deserving receivers who still haven't received Hall of Fame induction. Ward was a semifinalist for induction in 2025.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/steelers-all-quarter-century-team-several-current-and-future-hall-of-famers-headline-legendary-roster/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Steelers All-Quarter Century Team: Several current and future Hall of Famers headline legendary roster</p>\n                <p>\n                    Bryan DeArdo                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Steelers All-Quarter Century Team: Several current and future Hall of Famers headline legendary roster\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/06/19/fa354f5c-9cc5-4e0f-9439-11628dcf0b3d/thumbnail/270x152/c5babb04348ee4b3c2c4c6770ce413ee/troybigben.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>4. Alan Faneca, G (1998-07)&nbsp;</h2><p>Like Hines Ward, Fanaca also arrived in Pittsburgh via the 1998 <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>. He cracked the starting lineup as a rookie, and in 2001 began a streak of consecutive Pro Bowl selections that would extend beyond his time with the Steelers.&nbsp;</p><p>Faneca (who spent two years with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> and another with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> after leaving the Steelers) earned seven consecutive Pro Bowl nods and was a five-time All-Pro during his final seven seasons with the Steelers. He blocked for multiple 1,000-yard backs (Jerome Bettis and Willie Parker), protected two Pro Bowl quarterbacks (Kordell Stewart and Ben Roethlisberger) and helped fellow quarterback Tommy Maddox win Comeback Player of the Year in 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>While he had already reached All-Pro status, Faneca's claim to fame occurred in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> XL, when <a href=\"https://x.com/KevG163/status/1489989280000888834\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">his crushing block</a> sprang Parker loose for a 75-yard touchdown run, the longest run in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> history.&nbsp;</p><p>Faneca was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071793/t-j-watt/\">T.J. Watt</a>, OLB (2017-present)&nbsp;</h2><p>It doesn't get much better than Watt from an individual standpoint. During his first eight seasons, Watt was named to seven Pro Bowls, was a four-time All-Pro and was named the 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year after tying Michael Strahan's single-season record of 22.5 sacks.&nbsp;</p><p>Since 1982 (when the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> began recognizing sacks as an individual statistic), Watt is the only player who has led the league in sacks on three different occasions. Watt and Hall of Famer Reggie White are the only players over that span to record at least 13 sacks in four consecutive seasons. White is the only player to get to 100 career sacks faster than Watt, who did so in his 109th career game.&nbsp;</p><p>In Week 2 of the 2023 season, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/steelers-t-j-watt-breaks-james-harrisons-franchise-career-sack-record-vs-browns/\" target=\"_blank\">Watt broke</a></span> James Harrison's franchise career sack record. Watt's 108 sacks is the most in the NFL since the start of the 2017 season.&nbsp;</p><p>Sacks aside, Watt has led the NFL in force fumbles twice, including last season. He has also paced the league in tackles for loss on two occasions. Watt has also intercepted off seven passes and has broken up 49 more. &nbsp;</p><p>Simply put, Watt is one of the most productive, dominant and versatile defenders of his era. While he's only 30, Watt has already earned a spot on the long list of legendary defenders who have worn the black and gold.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/493043/ben-roethlisberger/\">Ben Roethlisberger</a>, QB (2004-21)&nbsp;</h2><p>While he didn't earn the top spot, it's safe to say that Roethlisberger is the player most responsible for the pair of Vince Lombardi Trophies the team has won this century.&nbsp;</p><p>Two decades after famously passing on Dan Marino during the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>, the Steelers didn't make the same mistake and took Roethlisberger with the 11th overall pick in 2004. Big Ben quickly proved that was a wise choice, as he helped lead the Steelers to a 15-1 record that season.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next six years, Roethlisberger helped lead the Steelers to two <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> wins and a third appearance in the big game. While his performance in his first <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> was mostly forgettable, Roethlisberger's previous three playoff games were anything but. Those games included his famous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/NFLonCBS/status/1342876455433363463\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">game-saving tackle</a> in Indianapolis and <a href=\"https://x.com/steelcitystar/status/1749296428885717308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">his virtuoso performance</a> in Pittsburgh's AFC title game win over Denver.&nbsp;</p><p>Roethlisberger's magnum opus was <a href=\"https://x.com/KevG163/status/1753055976763109625\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">his game-winning touchdown pass</a> in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> XLIII that capped off Pittsburgh's game-winning 88-yard drive. The throw has gone down in NFL lore, while the play is considered one of the greatest in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> history.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2010, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to a dramatic, come-from-behind win over the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> in the divisional round of the playoffs. While the Steelers lost to the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> in that year's <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>, Roethlisberger nonetheless became the 10th quarterback in history to start in at least three Super Bowls.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next decade, Roethlisberger established himself as one of the league's most prolific passers. He won two passing titles and in 2018 became the seventh quarterback in history to throw for at least 5,000 yards in a season. In 2014, Roethlisberger became the first player to throw six touchdowns in consecutive games. Three years later, Roethlisberger recorded his third game with at least 500 passing yards, an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> record.&nbsp;</p><p>From a franchise perspective, no one has played more games for the Steelers than Roethlisberger, who suited up in 272 games for the black and gold. He'll likely be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2027, the first year he is eligible.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Troy Polamalu, SS (2003-14)&nbsp;</h2><p>The Steelers wouldn't have won their two most recent Super Bowls without Roethlisberger, but it's safe to say they wouldn't have won them without the exploits of Polamalu, either. The team's best player since 2000, Polamalu gave the Steelers an edge that paid major dividends during two successful playoff runs.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 2005 AFC divisional round, Polamalu was all over the field during the Steelers' shocking win over <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/12531/peyton-manning/\">Peyton Manning</a> and the top-seeded Colts. He made <a href=\"https://x.com/sdextrasmedia/status/1219003048585916416\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a similar impact</a> during the following week's win over Denver in the AFC Championship game.&nbsp;</p><p>Three years later, Polamalu's pick-six in the AFC Championship game sealed the Steelers' second trip to the Super Bowl in four years. That was also the same year he made his jaw-dropping, <a href=\"https://x.com/CamHeywardFan/status/1698339310963921343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fingertip interception</a> against <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> quarterback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/493041/philip-rivers/\">Philip Rivers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2010, Polamalu became the sixth Steelers player to win NFL Defensive Player of the Year. That season, he submitted two of his most famous plays: <a href=\"https://x.com/willajrainbolt/status/1742687883666821559\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">his lunging sack</a> of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a> quarterback Kerry Collins in Week 1 and his <a href=\"https://x.com/AmandaFGodsey/status/1424192946765770756\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sack/forced fumble</a> of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> in Week 13 that led to a Steelers win.&nbsp;</p><p>A decade later, Polamalu's career was immortalized in Canton, Ohio, as he was inducted in his first year of eligibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Over the past week, three five-stars have announced their decisions, and 15 of the teams in the current top 25 secured at least one ESPN 300 commitment.</p><p>LSU used another in-state win to help boost its ranking as the Tigers were able to fend off Texas A&amp;M to keep local prospect <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256474/lamar-brown\">Lamar Brown</a> at home. The No. 1-ranked recruit is projected to the defensive line, where he can use his agility, flexibility and motor to be a disruptive presence. He brings added value as he also could excel on the offensive line.</p><p>After breaking into the rankings last week, Alabama is on the rise by adding multiple four-star (or better) prospects. Five-star safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256347/jireh-edwards\">Jireh Edwards</a> was one of those pickups; he gives the Tide a versatile defensive back with his blend of size, speed and physicality.</p><p>Oregon was a big mover despite the loss of an ESPN 300 commitment. The Ducks are the only team with three five-star prospects in their class, with OT <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259542/immanuel-iheanacho\">Immanuel Iheanacho</a> the latest addition. A massive and powerful presence in the trenches who could transition at tackle or move inside and be a quick contributor at guard, he joins fellow five-stars TE <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256476/kendre-harrison\">Kendre' Harrison</a> and safety <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256554/jett-washington\">Jett Washington</a> in the class.</p><p>The list of undeclared ESPN 300 prospects continues to shrink, with only four of 23 five-star prospects still uncommitted. That list will likely be cut in half before July comes to a close, so big changes are still to come.</p><p>Here's a look at our latest top 25.</p><p><strong>New this ranking:</strong> Louisville</p><p><strong>Out:</strong> Minnesota</p><p><em>(Previous update: July 3)</em></p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/30.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/30/usc-trojans\">USC Trojans</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 18<br>\n<strong>Top offensive prospect: </strong>OT <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/252293/keenyi-pepe\">Keenyi Pepe</a><br>\n<strong>Top defensive prospect: </strong>CB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256616/elbert-hill\">Elbert Hill</a></p><p>No program has more 2026 momentum than USC under Lincoln Riley, especially after hiring general manager Chad Bowden away from Notre Dame. The Trojans have double-digit ESPN 300 commits, with several joining the list since January. That includes two five-stars to start May in Pepe and Hill, and a pair of four-star commits who flipped from Big Ten rival Oregon: in-state defensive lineman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256506/tomuhini-topui\">Tomuhini Topui</a> and quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256697/jonas-williams\">Jonas Williams</a>. Topui is a physical, aggressive defensive tackle who could develop into an interior pass-rushing headache for opposing offenses, and Williams is a true dual-threat signal-caller.</p><p>USC also made it a point to beef up in the trenches. It pulled four-star defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/262373/jaimeon-winfield\">Jaimeon Winfield</a> out of Texas, landed in-state defensive end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256781/simote-katoanga\">Simote Katoanga</a> and traveled to Utah to snag Corner Canyon offensive lineman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259705/esun-tafa\">Esun Tafa</a>. To further bolster the O-line, the Trojans landed Pepe out of IMG Academy. He is huge at roughly 6-foot-7 and 320 pounds, but is light on his feet as well as physical and can become a standout tackle. On the perimeter, they will not have to wait for in-state defender <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256651/rj-sermons\">R.J. Sermons</a> as the ESPN 300 CB reclassified to 2025 and will join the Trojans this fall. For 2026, they pulled Elbert Hill, the top-ranked corner, out of the Midwest. Hill possesses elite speed, having been measured at over 22 mph in game play.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/61.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/61/georgia-bulldogs\">Georgia Bulldogs</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 2</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 16<br>\n<strong>Top offensive prospect:</strong> QB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256473/jared-curtis\">Jared Curtis</a><br>\n<strong>Top defensive prospect:</strong> CB <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256384/justice-fitzpatrick\">Justice Fitzpatrick</a></p><p>The Bulldogs have been a consistent staple among the top three overall classes during Kirby Smart's tenure and look to be a contender to do so again in 2026. A big step toward finishing near the top is bringing five-star quarterback Curtis back into the mix. After a decommitment, the Bulldogs were able to fend off other suitors, most notably Oregon, and give themselves a potential impact QB for the future. Curtis might need to adjust to a relatively steep jump in competition level, but he has elite physical tools, including a smooth, quick release and the ability to change arm angles.</p><p>With three of their top four pass catchers from 2024 having moved on and the fourth likely to leave after this season, Georgia is bringing in new receiving targets with speed. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/265206/brady-marchese\">Brady Marchese</a> has been recorded hitting over 22 mph in game play. After signing two ESPN 300 TEs in their 2025 class, the Dawgs continue to restock there, adding <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261348/lincoln-keyes\">Lincoln Keyes</a>, who with his big frame and good body control can offer a wide catch radius.</p><p>On defense, the Bulldogs have had 11 first-round NFL draft picks over the past five years and they continue to infuse that unit with top talent, including two of the top DBs in the country in Fitzpatrick and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/252291/zechariah-fort\">Zechariah Fort</a>.

In addition to landing the top-rated interior OL in the 2025 class, they have added several OLs to their 2026 class, led by No. 1 tackle Jackson Cantwell.

The Ducks also added a five-star prospect to their defense with the big-framed and rangy Jett Washington. A fluid safety with good ball skills and the ability to win jump-ball battles, he can also be a physical presence in the secondary.

Ranked No. 9 overall and the second-best defender in the ESPN 300, McCoy would be Florida's highest-rated defensive signee in more than a decade. The 6-foot-7, 260-pound Mississippi native brings elite length, explosive traits and a relentless motor that was on full display at the Under Armour All-America week in January. Beating out LSU and Texas for McCoy marks a major recruiting win for Napier, and McCoy has the potential to develop into one of the SEC's most feared defensive linemen.</p><p>A late close helped the Gators rise in the past cycle, but they've ascended much earlier this time around with an active summer.

An early but key pickup was QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256526/will-griffin\">Will Griffin</a>, who came on board in June 2024. A big-bodied passer with a strong arm and good accuracy, he could eventually be a nice transition from current QB DJ Lagway.

They surprised many by beating several top programs, including Michigan, for ESPN 300 WR Calvin Russell, a lengthy but smooth target who plans to also play basketball with the Orange.</p><p>Four-star defensive end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259104/jarius-rodgers\">Jarius Rodgers</a>, also out of Florida, is among Brown's biggest gets so far. The 6-5 220-pounder has tremendous length and an impressive track background. He has considerable physical tools and upside if Syracuse's coaching staff can harness it. Wilson is another big pull out of Florida; the edge defender has good initial quickness and tallied 17 sacks in 2024.</p><p>OT <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259692/javeion-cooper\">Javeion Cooper</a> has real upside too. He has good size (6-5, 300 pounds) yet plays with impressive balance for someone with his power and contact explosiveness. The Orange also have been active in the mid-Atlantic, landing three receivers from Delaware. Among that group is <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260478/bj-garrett\">B.J. Garrett</a>, a big target (6-3, 191 pounds) with good hands who could develop into a player in the mold of Oronde Gadsden, who had similar measurables coming out in the 2021 class.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/164.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>24. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"3f06733d-8d8a-7044-6b24-e0ba817e25f0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/164/rutgers-scarlet-knights\">Rutgers Scarlet Knights</a></h2><p><strong>Previous ranking:</strong> 18</p><p><strong>ESPN 300 commits:</strong> 3<br>\n<strong>Top offensive prospect:</strong> WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256492/dyzier-carter\">Dyzier Carter</a><br>\n<strong>Top defensive prospect:</strong> ATH <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260439/wydeek-collier\">Wydeek Collier</a></p><p>The Scarlet Knights have added some top talent to their wide receiver room with Carter and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256586/elias-coke\">Elias Coke</a>, both of whom have been long-time commits, having joined the class before the 2024 season started. Carter is a good route runner with strong hands and could be a quick contributor once arriving. Coke is a nice target at roughly 6-2.</p><p>On defense, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/265106/joey-kopec\">Joey Kopec</a> is a two-way player in high school, contributing at RB and LB.

LB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/264956/karsten-busch\">Karsten Busch</a> is a nice addition from within the state who will help on defense.

QB Briggs Cherry has performed well during in-person evaluations, including winning positional MVP during the UA New Orleans camp in March, and the strong-armed passer has risen in the rankings, proving to be a key January pickup.</p>\n</div></div>"

In the weight room, players go through the summer conditioning program, hollering encouragement and straining to hit unique benchmarks assigned to them. They have a singular focus taking hold.</p><p>On the screens around them, when they break down the end of a workout or when they text each other in group chats, all they see is \"1-0.\" Everyone in the building knows what that means: Beat Clemson in the season opener.</p><p>Upstairs, Ya'el Lofton bustles about her desk, waiting for coach Brian Kelly to arrive. Lofton has worked at LSU for more than 35 years -- including nearly 25 as the executive assistant to the head coach. \"You know,\" she says with a big smile, \"every head coach I have worked for has won a national championship.\"</p><p><i>Her</i> quiet anticipation, of course, is for Kelly to join Nick Saban, Les Miles and Ed Orgeron as a national champion. LSU went into the transfer portal, flush with more money to spend, and brought in one of the top classes in the country. Veteran quarterback <a data-player-guid=\"c3970aed-2e7b-34e0-bf3e-04af89ce8add\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4567747/garrett-nussmeier\">Garrett Nussmeier</a> returns, along with a more experienced defensive staff.</p><p>Every move has been calculated and points to this being a championship-or-bust season. But that all starts Aug. 30. LSU has never won an opener under Kelly. In fact, the Tigers have begun each of their past five seasons with a loss. So Kelly isn't talking about the end of the season. He is just talking about the beginning.</p><p>\"I've never really been, 'It's all or nothing,'\" Kelly says. \"This year is a change in our philosophy, in that we have to focus on Clemson.

Kelly says every transfer said the same thing: \"I'm here to win a championship.\"</p><p>As Kelly sees it, this is the first time since his surprise move from Notre Dame to LSU four years ago that he has had everything in place to compete for a championship: more financial support, university alignment, a more experienced staff, a culture built by players he has helped develop and transfers ready to fill the obvious holes.</p><p>When asked whether the roster and staff he has assembled for this year is one that can win a title, Kelly says yes. But he also throws in a caveat or two.</p><p>\"It's been a process, right?\" Kelly says. \"It's like anything else. It takes a little bit of time. This state relies on success. The governor told me the other night their best Mondays are after a win. We all know what that means and the expectations of it. But I stay focused on the process of building it.\"</p><p>Kelly contended for an SEC title in Year 1 in 2022 with young upstart quarterback (and future Heisman Trophy winner) Jayden Daniels, but he thinks that might have created unreasonable outside expectations for his program. Kelly says that season did not change the trajectory of the program under his leadership.</p><p>\"Those are the people that don't have enough information,\" Kelly says. \"They're just reacting emotionally, and you're going to have that, and that's great. We love that passion. With that passion comes unrealistic thoughts.\"</p><p>LSU won 10 games again in 2023, but despite Daniels' best efforts, the Tigers fell short of another SEC championship game appearance due to its poor defense. LSU ranked No. 105 in the country in total defense that season, allowing a whopping 6.14 yards per play and 28 points per game. Kelly revamped the entire defensive staff but saw mixed results in 2024 under Blake Baker.</p><p>That, combined with inconsistent play from Nussmeier, led to a 9-4 season and questions about whether Kelly was inching closer to hot seat territory. The low point came in a 42-13 home loss to Alabama in November, when a smattering of fans booed Kelly off the field and shouted for him to find a way out of Baton Rouge.</p><p>Afterward, Kelly said his team \"didn't play to the standard of LSU football.\"</p><p>Baker returns, more seasoned and experienced. But there are other reasons Kelly feels LSU might meet that high historical standard this season. First, he believes the roster and culture are in much better shape. Second, LSU was far more aggressive in the transfer portal.</p><p>\"We weren't committed to going into the portal in the manner that we were this year, and that commitment is in all areas,\" Kelly says. \"It's a financial commitment. ... Quite frankly, we weren't ready as a program to immerse ourselves deeply into the portal up until this year.</p><p>\"The foundation was still being built, and you need a strong culture. When you go into the portal and you bring in 13, 14 guys, they immediately immerse themselves into something that's established. We still needed another coat of paint, and so the timing was right, the commitment was better, and we clearly knew where our holes were that we needed to address. This was much more about fitting the culture.\"</p><p>The financial commitment is a significant one. Kelly and his wife, Paqui, decided to match donations up to $1 million for the football team's name, image and likeness efforts. Kelly says after he made that announcement in March, 1,600 donors gave money to LSU.</p><p>As a result of a more aggressive approach to the portal, LSU landed one of the best transfer classes in the country: two top-five wide receivers (<a data-player-guid=\"46bd3fbf-5b51-33f5-8307-891718f784ee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4698597/barion-brown\">Barion Brown</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"d556912e-93dc-32b0-bf54-a3642e942837\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4699866/nic-anderson\">Nic Anderson</a>), the No. 1 cornerback (<a data-player-guid=\"f1f80d34-d540-331e-92c3-2e1ea1647626\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4880124/mansoor-delane\">Mansoor Delane</a>), the No. 1 defensive end (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4596679/patrick-payton\">Pat Payton</a>), two of the best interior linemen (<a data-player-guid=\"9e8d4a6a-7907-353f-b668-8fcf32bd10f0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4735845/braelin-moore\">Braelin Moore</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"e775cccd-639d-35e2-a784-c0c3172bcb56\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4682692/josh-thompson\">Josh Thompson</a>) and one of the top tight ends in Oklahoma transfer <a data-player-guid=\"424f7916-c8ba-3c21-a1e7-44ab1cd65041\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4890373/bauer-sharp\">Bauer Sharp</a>.</p><p>LSU also signed anticipated defensive difference-makers <a data-player-guid=\"6117c2da-44f1-3213-8c0b-8ee54ee60bd2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4837252/jack-pyburn\">Jack Pyburn</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"ab8c1ebb-0015-3b20-96a2-82dd0a02fbfe\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4599738/jimari-butler\">Jimari Butler</a> and defensive tackle <a data-player-guid=\"ca962523-636c-301f-83bb-78d103b64604\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4870908/sydir-mitchell\">Sydir Mitchell</a>. In addition, they had 13 early enrollees, including No. 1 cornerback DJ Pickett. <a data-player-guid=\"61021f21-a9f0-362e-b11b-f408e88e7aef\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4685502/harold-perkins-jr\">Harold Perkins Jr</a>., a Freshman All-American in 2022 who missed much of last season with a torn ACL, is expected to be healthy for the opener.</p><p>But even given all the moves LSU has made, Kelly says he does not feel any more pressure to deliver a championship in 2025.</p><p>\"What it really means is that LSU football is among the elite,\" Kelly says. \"Only one team goes home with that championship. [The fans] want to do it every year. But they want an elite football team. They want one that is competing for a championship. 9-4 is not competing for a championship. You're out of the discussion when you lose your third game. And so it's my job to put this program back in elite status.\"</p><p>Kelly is asked whether the program is at elite status now.</p><p>\"We'll go find out,\" he says.</p><hr><p><strong>THAT BRINGS US</strong> back to Clemson. LSU has not won a season opener since 2019, the year Joe Burrow led the Tigers to their last national championship. The past three opening losses, under Kelly, came in neutral site, marquee national spotlight games -- two to Florida State and one to USC last season, when the Trojans scored the winning touchdown with eight seconds remaining.</p><p>Nussmeier was the quarterback then, and he will be the quarterback again when LSU plays Clemson for the first time since ... the national title game in 2020. He returned for a final season with the Tigers to bring a national championship back to LSU. But if that is the end goal, beating Clemson is the first goal.</p><p>\"In the past, we maybe have looked too far forward at the season, so I think that's been a very good mind switch for us,\" Nussmeier said. \"Coach Kelly has made it very clear what our mindset is going into Week 1.</p><p>\"I haven't seen that since I've been here. When you're at LSU, you have expectations. Everybody talks about, 'Can LSU win the national championship?' It's not, 'Can LSU make a bowl game?' So while we acknowledge, yes, our goal is to win a national championship, it starts with beating Clemson Week 1.\"</p><p>Given the 12-team College Football Playoff, a loss to Clemson would not automatically eliminate LSU from championship contention. But the program does not want to start the season with doubts. Getting out of the gate with a win would be huge.</p><p>\"Once we accomplish that goal, that momentum that we're going to get from that win, who knows where it leads us,\" Sharp said.</p><p>For his part, Kelly has his own quiet confidence about the season. As Kelly has pointed out, he has won everywhere he has been, from Division II Grand Valley State to Notre Dame. When he left the Irish, he was the program's all-time winningest coach.</p><p>When he got to LSU, he told The Associated Press, \"I want to be in an environment where I have the resources to win a national championship,\" a statement that resurfaced this past season after Notre Dame made it to the national title game, while Kelly has yet to get there with the Tigers.</p><p>The resources now seem to be in place. In addition to the renewed financial commitment and aggressive portal push, LSU expanded its operations center last year with a new recovery suite that includes everything from nutrition and fueling stations, a reimagined athletic training and rehab area, plus a hydrotherapy suite and float tanks designed to help players \"achieve deep relaxation and mental clarity.\"</p><p>Whether that translates into a championship is still to be determined. In a few weeks, the quiet anticipation will grow more urgent as practices begin and the season inches closer to that very first goal: Beat Clemson and get to 1-0.</p>\n</div></div>"

As has been the case all year, the strong favorites entering the tournament are Scottie Scheffler (9/2) and Rory McIlroy (7-1). This ater McIlroy's runner-up performance at the Scottish Open closed the gap on the odds sheet to Scheffler, who finished T8 but was six shots back of eventual winner Chris Gotterup (90-1).</p><p>Scheffler is seeking his first Open Championship win after registering his best finish in the Open last year with a T7. McIlroy is pursuing his second win at The Open, and he has plenty of motivation with the major being back in his home of Northern Ireland, where he would desperately love to bring home his sixth major championship. It would be quite a capper on a season that included his first Masters, clinching the career grand slam just three months ago.</p><p>Behind those two is Jon Rahm (12-1), whose terrific record on links courses and in The Open have oddsmakers bullish on his ability to contend. Rahm is still searching for his first Claret Jug, but his inspired play this season suggests it might be around the corner.</p><p>There's a significant gap between that top three and the rest of the field as Bryson DeChambeau (20-1) comes in fourth due to his recent struggles at The Open. In seven playings at the major, he has three missed cuts and three more finishes T33 or worse.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Reigning champion at The Open, Xander Schauffele (25-1), is next on the board, but his struggles this season have him as a longer shot to repeat. Lowry (30-1) will be hoping to recapture the magic of 2019, while other recent Open champions like Collin Morikawa (30-1), Jordan Spieth (55-1), Cameron Smith (110-1) and Brian Harman (120-1) will have designs on adding a second Claret Jug to their collection.&nbsp;</p><p>Below you can find the complete list of tournament winner odds for the 2025 Open Championship.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>2025 Open Championship odds</h2><p><em>Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook</em></p><ul><li>Scottie Scheffler (9/2)</li><li>Rory McIlroy (7-1)</li><li>Jon Rahm (12-1)</li><li>Bryson DeChambeau (20-1)</li><li>Xander Schauffele (25-1)</li><li>Ludvig Åberg (28-1)</li><li>Tommy Fleetwood (28-1)</li><li>Tyrrell Hatton (30-1)</li><li>Shane Lowry (30-1)</li><li>Viktor Hovland (30-1)</li><li>Collin Morikawa (30-1)</li><li>Robert MacIntyre (35-1)</li><li>Sepp Straka (50-1)</li><li>Joaquin Niemann (50-1)</li><li>Justin Thomas (50-1)</li><li>Brooks Koepka (55-1)</li><li>Matt Fitzpatrick (55-1)</li><li>Jordan Spieth (55-1)</li><li>Patrick Cantlay (55-1)</li><li>Russell Henley (65-1)</li><li>Justin Rose (75-1)</li><li>Corey Conners (75-1)</li><li>Cameron Young (80-1)</li><li>Hideki Matsuyama (80-1)</li><li>Sam Burns (80-1)</li><li>Patrick Reed (80-1)</li><li>Adam Scott (80-1)</li><li>Ryan Fox (90-1)</li><li>Ben Griffin (90-1)</li><li>Jason Day (90-1)</li><li>Chris Gotterup (90-1)</li><li>Keegan Bradley (100-1)</li><li>Min Woo Lee (110-1)</li><li>Cameron Smith (110-1)</li><li>Si Woo Kim (110-1)</li><li>Harry Hall (110-1)</li><li>Harris English (110-1)</li><li>J.J.

From July 14 to July 17, the league's coaches will either get through their allotted time slot as quickly as possible, or they will take their chance to hype their respective teams just over a month before the season gets into full swing.&nbsp;</p><p>Though there are no new schools, or even new coaches, entering the league in 2025, there's still plenty to look forward to. Few names will demand as much attention as <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> quarterback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/\">Arch Manning</a>, who will travel with coach Steve Sarkisian to represent the Longhorns in Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><p>Manning, a former No. 1 overall recruit and scion of one of the most notable football families to ever grace the game, is entering his much-anticipated first season as Texas' starter. He is also one of 11 expected starting quarterbacks that will be present at SEC Media Days.&nbsp;</p><p>Texas is one of several SEC teams that are expected to be in the mix for a 12-team <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff, though the conference will be hunting for its first national title since 2022. It will be fascinating to see if <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> improves from its somewhat disappointing nine-win campaign in its first year under new coach Kalen DeBoer, or how <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> -- which lost starting quarterback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123367/nico-iamaleava/\">Nico Iamaleava</a> to the transfer portal late in the spring -- follows up its first playoff appearance in program

That doesn't mean you leave or in a marathon, it doesn't mean you step off the course. The burden of making a new system work is certainly on commissioners and conference offices, but the responsibility is shared with our campuses and campus leaders.\"</p><p>Sankey said conversations with university presidents this spring included the potential of the Power Four forming a committee to explore its role in the future of college athletics. The committee, Sankey cited, would include multiple presidents from each league and the commissioners for each league.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>On College Football Playoff expansion</h2><p>Sankey was <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-playoff-straight-seeding-model-adopted-for-2025-what-it-means-for-conference-champions/\" target=\"_blank\">complimentary of the playoff's straight-seeding model</a></span> adopted ahead of the 2025 season. Under the new seeding process, the top four teams in the selection committee's final rankings get a first-round pass to the quarterfinals.&nbsp;</p><p>Last season, the four highest-ranked conference champions earned that distinction regardless of where those teams were slotted by the selection committee. He also advocated for expansion of the field in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>\"We think growth beyond 12 can be positive and should be pursued,\" Sankey said.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Sankey said the SEC \"has the best hand to play\" in the expansion debate and that his league will continue hold steady with its opinion on how future brackets should look relating to automatic bids and other details.</p><h2>On future SEC scheduling</h2><p>Sankey did not reveal if his conference is moving to nine games in 2026, which has been a hot-button topic for several years.</p><p>\"It's absolutely, fully and 100% correct that we play eight conference games, while others play nine conference games,\" Sankey said. \"It's also correct that last season, all 16 (of our) members played at least nine games against, what you would label, power opponents. I don't believe there's anyone looking to swap their conference schedule and their opponents with our conference schedule.</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"I handed out a bunch of stats that created a stir in Destin (at SEC spring meetings) that showed there's a rigor here that is unique.\"</p><p>Sankey said his team is continuing to evaluate weather increasing the number of SEC games annually. He's not providing a date to reveal the 2026 football schedule and said decisions are coming soon.</p><p>\"We have to make decisions (soon), if we're going to nine games,\" Sankey said. \"If we stay at eight, it'll probably be a little bit easier logistically.\"</p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Grab some water, take a seat, and catch your breath. Collect yourself. We've got the whole second half of the season left, but right now, it's time to just relax.</p><p>Over the next few days at Fantasy Baseball Today headquarters, we're going to still be right here, making sure you're ready for the second half. On the podcast side of things, we're going to be talking some <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> draft stuff, for those of you in Dynasty leagues, and we're going to be taking a look ahead at the second half, focusing on Sleepers, Breakouts, and Busts, plus a full re-drafting of the first couple of rounds with an eye on the second half (and beyond).</p><p>And the newsletter is going to follow a similar format, beginning today. We're not doing our usual weekend recap – scroll down for the biggest news coming out of the weekend, though. Instead, I've got some waiver-wire targets for every position in Fantasy for you, including one player to stash for the second half. Because the nice thing about this week is there's a bit less of a need to focus on immediate help, since there aren't any games until Friday. Our banged-up players can get healthy, rotations will be reset, and we can just take a longer view of things.</p><p>So that's what we've got for you today. Tomorrow, I'll be here with some second-half sleepers to target either in trades or on the waiver wire, and we'll have more to get you ready for the second half the rest of the week. And the games will be back before you know it.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Week 17 Waiver Targets</h2><h3>Catchers</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2483273/sean-murphy/fantasy/\">Sean Murphy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\">Braves</a> (37%) – With the Braves looking like playoff longshots, I'm hoping for a Sean Murphy trade, which would clear him for more playing time and give <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075524/drake-baldwin/fantasy/\">Drake Baldwin</a> a clearer path to an everyday role. Both have top-12 upside, but Murphy has seen the playing time tilt back his way as he's been hot, with four homers in his past five games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One player to stash: </strong>Samuel Basallo, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a> (31%) – If the Orioles didn't call Basallo up when they had four catchers placed on the IL in quick succession, does it really make sense for them to call him up with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117469/adley-rutschman/fantasy/\">Adley Rutschman</a> on the mend? Probably not, but he's still hitting .261/.383/.576 as a 20-year-old at Triple-A, and if they decided to make some moves to sell at the deadline, that could open an opportunity in their crowded 1B/DH field, too.&nbsp;</p><h3>First Base</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117474/andrew-vaughn/fantasy/\">Andrew Vaughn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a> (14%) – I don't really have a lot of hope for Vaughn becoming a real contributor for the Brewers, but it's hard to argue with the early returns: Two homers and 10 RBI in his first five games. He's a former top prospect, so maybe just getting away from the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHW/chicago-white-sox/\">White Sox</a> and into a more competent organization will be enough to get Vaughn on track.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>One player to stash: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211203/ryan-mountcastle/fantasy/\">Ryan Mountcastle</a>, Orioles (15%) – I want there to be a more interesting choice here, but there aren't many options – the top first base prospect remaining in the minors is probably <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153551/bryce-eldridge/fantasy/\">Bryce Eldridge</a>, who is dealing with a hamstring injury that has kept him out the past few days and has just a .710 OPS in his first 16 games at Triple-A, so we probably won't see him until September. So we'll stash Mountcastle, who is working his way back from his own hamstring injury and still has some upside despite a pretty terrible first 52 games to open the season. He's definitely a trade candidate for the Orioles before the deadline, too.&nbsp;</p><h3>Second base</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615338/colt-keith/fantasy/\">Colt Keith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a> (46%) – Keith might deserve more credit than he's been getting lately. His production hasn't jumped off the page yet – he has mostly settled in as a solid, but unspectacular hitter – but the underlying data suggests there's another level to be reached here. For the season, he has a .371 xwOBA compared to an actual .344 mark, and over the past 100 plate appearances, he's been even better, with a .404 xwOBA that would rank as a top-25 mark in the entire league for the season. He's taken a step forward as a power hitter without sacrificing plate discipline, and it's made Keith look like a solid starter at either position he is eligible for.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One player to stash: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29321958/luke-keaschall/fantasy/\">Luke Keaschall</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Twins</a> (24%) – Keaschall has been out since late April due to a fractured forearm, but he's been able to take part in live batting practice in recent days and should be close to a rehab assignment. Keaschall showed a terrific approach at the plate in the minors and in his very brief stint in the majors, but the most exciting thing about his early-season run was how aggressive he had been on the bases, with nine steals in 21 games between Triple-A and the majors. With a likely return in late July, Keaschall has the potential to make a real difference down the stretch.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h3>Third base</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3077711/noelvi-marte/fantasy/\">Noelvi Marte</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Reds</a> (65%) – Marte had a nice weekend, hitting a couple of homers and adding a steal to continue his solid little breakout campaign. In nine games since coming off the IL, Marte is hitting .259 with three homers, a steal, and a .953 OPS, and he's put together something close to a 30-30 pace in the 28 games he has played. This is a former top prospect who has an everyday job and has been very good when on the field this season, so I'm gonna say he needs to be rostered pretty much universally, just in case this is the breakout it's starting to look like.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26723699/brady-house/fantasy/\">Brady House</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/WAS/washington-nationals/\">Nationals</a> (26%) – House hasn't looked overwhelmed so far, and in July, he's starting to look like he belongs. His strikeout rate is down to 21.4%, right around the league average, and he's hitting .293/.310/.488 after his two-homer game Saturday. We've seen a bit of aggression on the bases and a solid approach at the plate, buoyed by an excellent .303 expected batting average, and House looks like he might be tapping into a bit of upside lately. In deeper leagues, he's a fine target.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One player to stash:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2106304/max-muncy/fantasy/\">Max Muncy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> (74%) – Muncy has already missed 10 days with his knee injury, an injury that was expected to cause him to miss six weeks. We're probably still another month away from him returning, but Muncy should be worth the wait – he was hitting .282/.410/.546 with a near-40-homer pace from May 1 on.</p>\n        \n\n<h3>Shortstop</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26608279/ha-seong-kim/fantasy/\">Ha-seong Kim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/\">Rays</a> (25%) – Kim isn't the kind of player we typically worry about exit velocities or hard-hit rates for, because even at his best, he's a fringe-y power hitter. But it's worth keeping an eye on the early returns with him coming back from shoulder surgery, and they've been very positive – several batted balls over 105 mph, 54% of his batted balls have been over 95, and his average is 90.5. That doesn't mean Kim is suddenly going to be a power hitter, but it's a good sign that he isn't dealing with too many lingering effects from the surgery. If he's healthy, Kim is a good bet for a 10-homer, 30-plus-steal pace, and he looks healthy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One player to stash: </strong>Jordan Lawler, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/\">Diamondbacks</a> (30%) – A full teardown seems incredibly unlikely, but some retooling seems like a safe assumption from a Diamondbacks team that looks like a longshot to make the playoffs and has two starters on the infield heading into free agency. If they trade either <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1960254/eugenio-suarez/fantasy/\">Eugenio Suarez</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184448/josh-naylor/fantasy/\">Josh Naylor</a> – Naylor seems much more likely right now – that should finally give Lawlar a chance to play every day. Once he gets healthy, of course – Lawlar has been out since late June with a hamstring injury, but was hitting .319/.410/.583 at the level before the injury. He remains a potential difference maker. &nbsp;</p><h3>Outfield</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3152105/kyle-stowers/fantasy/\">Kyle Stowers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> (74%) – When Stowers went over a month without a homer from mid-May to mid-June, it wasn't unreasonable to assume he had turned back into a pumpkin. Stowers was always a fringe-y prospect, so when it looked like he just had a hot start to the season, Fantasy players were willing to say, \"Thanks for the help,\" and drop him. But that was clearly premature. Stowers was already bouncing back nicely from that slump even before Sunday's five-hit, three-homer game against the Orioles. Add that in, and he's hitting .385/.444/.846 so far in July and has his xwOBA up to .411 over the past 100 PA. Stowers' plate discipline is a problem, but when he makes contact, he continues to do more than enough damage to make up for it, and at this point, he probably just needs to be viewed as a viable starter in all Fantasy leagues moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836883/tyler-freeman/fantasy/\">Tyler Freeman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/\">Rockies</a> (41%) – Freeman might just be a viable starter in all formats, too. Even after a 1-for-13 weekend against the Reds, Freeman is hitting .340 in July, which is actually worse than what he hit in June. He probably isn't going to keep hitting like prime Tony Gwynn, but the underlying skills – including a 9.3% strikeout rate – suggest Freeman should nonetheless remain a very good source of batting average. And then you add on Coors Field's average-inflating properties, and yeah, this guy might have a chance to hit .320 the rest of the way while stealing 20-plus bases. I might prefer Freeman straight up to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821318/luis-arraez/fantasy/\">Luis Arraez</a> at this point.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2171342/tyler-oneill/fantasy/\">Tyler O'Neill</a>, Orioles (41%) – We haven't seen much from O'Neill since March, really, and maybe this just won't be his year. We've seen that from the mercurial O'Neill plenty of times in the past, and it's not like the underlying data gives us a ton to be optimistic about right now. On the other hand, O'Neill is coming off a season where he had 31 homers in 113 games, and that kind of demonstrated upside just doesn't sit on the waiver wire very often. Hopefully, the All-Star break gives him a chance to reset and tap back into the upside we know is there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One player to stash: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920019/chase-delauter/fantasy/\">Chase DeLauter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Guardians</a> (28%) – DeLauter has been dealing with a wrist injury in recent days, which is obviously worrisome given his lengthy injury history. And it may be yet another malady that trips him up and prevents him from living up to his considerable potential. But if it's just a minor injury, I'm still viewing DeLauter as one of the top prospects to stash in the whole league, given his combination of success at Triple-A and obvious positional need in Cleveland. The 23-year-old is hitting .278/383/.476 at Triple-A this season despite missing so much of his key developmental period, and if he does get the chance in the second half, I still believe there is significant upside in his bat.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h3>Starting pitcher</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615456/joe-boyle/fantasy/\">Joe Boyle</a>, Rays (48%) – Boyle is in a weird spot. He both is and isn't in the Rays rotation right now. As in, he's in the rotation of pitchers, but he isn't starting right now, instead piggybacking off <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837374/drew-rasmussen/fantasy/\">Drew Rasmussen</a> in each of his past two starts, during which he has struck out eight and walked three in nine innings of work while allowing two runs. We'd like to see more strikeouts, and frankly, I expect more moving forward, so the biggest question is whether he can get up to six innings consistently while pitching in relief. If so, Boyle is going to be an impactful arm no matter the role.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075539/emmet-sheehan/fantasy/\">Emmet Sheehan</a>, Dodgers (62%) – Sheehan has been used as both a starter and a bulk reliever this season, and he's been excellent in any role, allowing three earned runs in 13.1 innings with 13 strikeouts and four walks. Like Boyle, there is some ambiguity around his role, especially with the Dodgers rotation starting to get healthier and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2901324/shohei-ohtani/fantasy/\">Shohei Ohtani</a> starting to get stretched out more. That could lead to a trip back to Triple-A or more of a pure relief role, but I think the upside is so high with Sheehan – who has 49 strikeouts to just six talks in 33 innings across the majors and minors – that I'm going to add and hold him through the break to see what the plan is here.&nbsp;</p><p>Cam Schlittler, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a> (53%) – Schlittler looked excellent in his <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> debut last week, striking out seven in 5.1 innings of work. You'll be unsurprised to learn that there is also some question about what his role will be in the second half – <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2829343/luis-gil/fantasy/\">Luis Gil</a> hopes to be back in the rotation in the next few weeks, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2167343/ryan-yarbrough/fantasy/\">Ryan Yarbrough</a> could be back eventually, too – but there's a reason I'm not worried about that right now: With the All-Star break here, we've got a few extra days to worry about what a player's role will be. If it turns out these guys aren't actually going to be in the rotation, you can drop them at the end of this week and move on to someone safer. But the upside with all three of these pitchers is significant enough to be well worth chasing right now. Plus, look at it this way: If injuries paved the way for all three to get their chances in the first place, there's always the chance (and perhaps a very good one) that injuries continue to give them a chance in the future. Life finds a way.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>One player to stash: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29295979/zebby-matthews/fantasy/\">Zebby Matthews</a>, Twins (29%) – Matthews made his first rehab start Sunday as he works his way back from a shoulder injury, and he was dominant. Working over four shutout, no-hit innings, Matthews struck out nine and needed just 56 pitches to record his 12 outs. We'll likely need to see another couple of starts from Matthews so his pitch count can get closer to 80-plus, but he sure looks like he's dealing with no ill effects from the injury and absolutely could be a second-half difference maker.&nbsp;</p><h3>Relief pitcher</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135575/raisel-iglesias/fantasy/\">Raisel Iglesias</a>, Braves (68%) – I've been operating under the assumption all along that the Braves planned to eventually get Iglesias back in the closer's role, and it looks like that might have happened this week. Iglesias got the save on both Friday and Saturday, the first time a Braves pitcher has gotten consecutive saves since mid-May, before Iglesias lost the job. Getting him right and back in the closer's role was always going to be the best outcome for the Braves, and it sure looks like they've figured it out, as he has 20 strikeouts to just three walks with a 2.35 ERA since the start of June, a stretch of 15.1 innings. When he's right, Iglesias is a must-start closer, and it looks like he's back.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One player to stash: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837519/cade-smith/fantasy/\">Cade Smith</a>, Guardians (29%) – I don't know how likely it is that the Guardians will actually trade <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3107591/emmanuel-clase/fantasy/\">Emmanuel Clase</a>, but they enter the second half fourth in the weak AL Central, 12 games behind the Tigers and 4.5 games out of a Wild Card spot, behind five different teams. So, if they were going to sell, this might be the time. Clase would fetch a huge haul on the market, and Smith is more than capable of stepping into his role, with a career 2.26 ERA and 1.61 WHIP. Smith could be a top-five closer if he got the chance.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

N.J. –</span> It was the type of performance that sucked the life out of the opposition quickly. Players in wide spaces seized every moment they could find, catching the opponents by surprise, scoring early enough to put the game out of reach by halftime. That is how <span>Paris</span> Saint-Germain played in the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/chelsea-vs-psg-score-cole-palmer-records-two-goals-blues-dominate-ucl-champs-in-club-world-cup-final/live/\">UEFA Champions League final against Inter</a>, and again in their <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/psg-obliterate-kylian-mbappe-and-real-madrid-in-club-world-cup-semifinals-will-face-chelsea-in-final/\">Club World Cup semifinal against Real Madrid</a> on Wednesday. It was also how <span>Chelsea</span> played at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, beating PSG at their own game to win the first edition of the expanded Club World Cup.</p><p>\"Going into the game straightaway, we set the tone,\" Chelsea's Levi Colwill said post-match. \"We pressed the life out of them. We knew this was our last game of football for the season so there's no way I was going to go on holiday and sit there thinking, 'I wish I could have gave that little bit more for the team,' and I've told everyone this before, and we went and gave everything and that's what the scoreline reflects and that's why we won today.\"</p><p>The mindset resembled PSG's all-gas-no-breaks style that made them Europe's most entertaining team for the last six months, quickly overwhelming the opposition en route to their first Champions League title and making them the favorites to win the Club World Cup. They got a taste of their own medicine quickly in the New York City suburbs – they looked fatigued quickly as Chelsea took the game to them, going down 2-0 by the half-hour mark thanks to a brace from <span>Cole Palmer</span> and conceding a third before the break thanks to <span>Joao Pedro</span>. Fatigue quickly set in for PSG, the individual players fading one by one as a win quickly slipped out of reach. Frustration kicked in with a few tense moments, most notably with <span>Joao Neves</span>' 89th-minute red card and a <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/psg-manager-luis-enrique-involved-in-altercation-with-chelseas-joao-pedro-after-club-world-cup-final/\">post-match scuffle involving PSG manager Luis Enrique and Chelsea's Joao Pedro</a>.</p>\n<p>\"I think that PSG are a team that, you either press them high or you'll be in trouble because they have so many talented players,\" manager Enzo Maresca said post-match, \"but if you give them time to link up and get the ball, they're so good that in my personal opinion, if you give them time, then you'll be worse off.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Chelsea, though, put their own spin on things. In a match between two teams that prefer to hold the ball, the Blues happily ceded possession to PSG and had just 34% possession when all was said and done. The attacking plan was sound, though – they outshot PSG 10 to eight and posted 2.06 expected goals to the opponent's 0.53. The intense first half paved the way for a routine second, the mission more or less accomplished by halftime.</p><p><em>Start your day with the perfect blend of news and analysis from the world's game with the Morning Footy podcast.&nbsp; Download and follow Morning Footy on</em><a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/MorningFooty\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em> Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/MorningFooty\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em> Spotify</em></a><em> or wherever you get your podcasts!</em></p><p>\"They have three midfielders,\" Maresca noted. \"Two of them [Neves and Fabian Ruiz], they were in charge for Reece [<span>James</span>] and <span>Moises</span> [Caicedo]. <span>Vitinha</span> was in charge for Enzo [<span>Fernandez</span>]. Analyzing them, we saw that was a good opportunity to exploit that space and we used Cole and Malo [Gusto] in that side to create a little bit and overloaded that side and [tat] was just the game plan.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Setting the tone, as Colwill referenced, was crucial to the success of Maresca's plan.</p><p>\"The idea was to go man to man,\" Maresca said. \"I think PSG, they are so good that if you give them time, you are going to struggle. In my personal opinion, you have to press them very intense. I think the first 10 minutes, we were able to do it. In our ideal world, we have to do that for 90 minutes, 95 but we knew that because of the weather conditions, [it] was not possible to do for long time but we tried to be very aggressive, don't give them time and then on the ball, we had some very good moments. We exploited the space that we planned and [it] was very good.\"</p><p>It comes as little shock that Palmer, the Blues' brightest star, would deliver in moments like this one. The <span>England</span> international is <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/cole-palmers-cold-mentality-how-chelsea-star-stole-the-show-in-conference-league-final-postgame-interviews/\">building a habit of delivering in major moments</a> and is easily at the top of the depth chart as <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ranking-all-20-of-chelseas-attackers-from-star-cole-palmer-to-flop-mykhailo-mudryk-and-everything-in-between/\">Chelsea's 20 attackers</a> do what they can to earn valuable playing time. The surprise, though, was that Joao Pedro also felt like a natural fit on the field alongside Palmer. Less than two weeks ago, Joao Pedro was still on Brighton and Hove Albion's books but now has three goals in three games for Chelsea, earning a start in the final over Liam Delap, who had been the go-to earlier in the competition.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Maresca has lauded Joao Pedro for his versatility, noting that he can play in multiple positions across the front line, but his ability to make an impact against organized defenses is making him a quick favorite with the manager.</p>\n<p>\"Joao, I can say, is an amazing player,\" Maresca said. \"We can really use him with teams that defend in a very low block with no spaces because he's really good in tight spaces.\"</p><p>The vision for this version of Chelsea may not have always been clear, but a year after Maresca's hire, the chaos of roster building still looms large three years after BlueCo acquired the club and American businessman Todd Boehly assumed his role as chairman. Even amidst the disorganization, Chelsea's Club World Cup win offered a glimpse at what they can be at their very best – and that their belief in a group of rising talents is well-founded. But first, a well-deserved break is in order.</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"I think that during this season, we were heading towards the right direction and we ended our season very well and now we lifted this trophy, a fantastic trophy,\" Maresca said. \"About the future, fortunately, I have three weeks' vacation now because that's all I want. It's been 15 months nonstop, and then we'll see what happens next season.\"</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals\">Washington Nationals</a> selected Eli Willits with the No. 1 pick, opting for the prep shortstop -- who might be more likely to sign below slot -- in a draft with no clear-cut top prospect. And there were plenty of other intriguing selections as the first three rounds unfolded Sunday night.</p><p>The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"56d60582-088f-6848-5180-1fb04440cf87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a> had to have been thrilled to have Kiley McDaniel's No. 1-ranked prospect, Kade Anderson, fall to them at No. 3, and Ethan Holliday was selected at No. 4 by his famous father's former squad the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f3f1ba71-05f1-a49a-0363-3b1d8e0db4cf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies\">Colorado Rockies</a>.</p><p>We asked ESPN baseball insiders Alden Gonzalez, Jesse Rogers and David Schoenfield to break down their favorite and most head-scratching moves of the draft's first night, as well as to predict which players will bring the most to their new teams in the long term.</p><hr><h2>A lot of us were thrown for a loop by the first two selections. What do you make of the Nationals taking Eli Willits at No. 1 and the Angels picking Tyler Bremner at No. 2?</h2><p><strong>Gonzalez:</strong> I was stunned on both accounts. Though there was definitely some uncertainty around the Nationals' approach, especially since the firing of GM Mike Rizzo, I didn't see anybody, anywhere, projecting Willits to be their choice at No. 1 overall. But the Angels drafting Bremner was an even bigger risk. Kiley had him 18th in his latest ranking. Six pitchers were ranked ahead of him. But Bremner might be someone who can rise and impact their major league roster quickly, and the Angels are always looking for that.</p><p><strong>Rogers: </strong>The first two picks really summed up the uncertainty of the entire draft. The Nationals' faith in a 17-year-old will be tested over the coming years, but the pick will likely save them some money for later in this draft and give Willits time to grow. The same can be said of many of the top picks: They're going to need time. There are far fewer sure things this year -- though Bremner could be the exception. The Angles love to graduate their players quickly, and as a college arm, he could see the majors sooner rather than later. Like Willits, this could also be a cost-saving move for later spending.</p><p><strong>Schoenfield:</strong> In a draft that not only lacked a sure-thing No. 1 overall pick but was viewed as weaker at the top than those of recent years, it's perhaps not a huge surprise that the Nationals and Angels used their picks to strike likely underslot deals with Willits and Bremner, giving them money to spend later in the draft -- which they can use on high school prospects who might have slipped, trying to buy them out from going to college. It's a strategy teams have used with success over the years, so the drafts for the Nationals and Angels will have to be viewed in their totality and not just focused on these two players.</p><hr><h2>What was your favorite pick of the night -- and which one had you scratching your head?</h2><p><strong>Gonzalez: </strong>The Rockies have done a lot of things wrong over these last few ... uh, decades. But it was really cool to see them take Ethan Holliday at No. 4 after his father, Matt, starred in Colorado for so long. Outside of the top two picks, Ethan Conrad going 17th to the Cubs was my biggest surprise of the night. Kiley had him ranked 30th; others had him falling out of the first round entirely. There's uncertainty coming off shoulder surgery. But Conrad, 21, put up a 1.238 OPS in 97 plate appearances before his season ended prematurely in March. And the dearth of college bats probably influenced a slight reach here.</p><p><strong>Rogers:</strong> I'm loving Billy Carlson to the White Sox at No. 10. Though they lost 121 games last season, Chicago couldn't pick higher than this spot per CBA rules -- but the Sox might have gotten a top-five player. Carlson's defense will play extremely well behind a sneaky good and young pitching staff that should keep the ball on the ground in the long term. Meanwhile, with the pick of the litter when it came to hitters -- college outfielders and high school kids as well -- the Pirates took a high school pitcher at No. 6. Seth Hernandez could be great, but they need hitting. A lot of it.</p><p><strong>Schoenfield:</strong> The Mariners reportedly wanted LSU left-hander Kade Anderson all along, but they certainly couldn't have been expecting to get him with the third pick. (Keep in mind that the Mariners were lucky in the first place to land the third pick in the lottery, so they added some good fortune on top of good luck.) They get the most polished college pitcher in the draft, one who should move quickly -- and perhaps make it a little easier for Jerry Dipoto to dip into his farm system and upgrade the big league roster at the trade deadline. Even though I understand why the Angels did it, Bremner still seems a little questionable. With the second pick, you want to go for a home run, and the consensus is that Holliday or even Anderson is more likely to be a more impactful major leaguer. Bremner's lack of a third plus pitch is an issue, and you have to wonder if the Angels are relying too much on his control -- which, yes, should allow him to get to the majors -- and ignoring the possible lack of upside.</p><hr><h2>Who is the one player you'd like to plant your flag on as the biggest steal of this draft?</h2><p><strong>Gonzalez: </strong>Seth Hernandez, who went sixth to the Pirates and should someday share a rotation with <a data-player-guid=\"cdfd69c1-1b9b-30fe-acf4-aad457b0850e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719507/paul-skenes\">Paul Skenes</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"d6f815fb-3c01-3e45-9978-1f7337437b87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4918156/jared-jones\">Jared Jones</a>. High school pitchers are incredibly risky, especially when taken so early in the draft. But Hernandez is a great athlete who already throws hard, boasts a plus changeup and showed improvement with his breaking ball this spring. He'll go the Hunter Greene route, from standout high school pitcher to major league ace.</p><p><strong>Rogers: </strong>Jamie Arnold will look like a steal at No. 11, especially when he debuts in the majors well before many of the players taken around him. I'm not worried about the innings drop in 2025 -- not when he was striking out 119 hitters and walking just 27. The A's need to polish him up but will be pleased by how consistent he'll be. You can't go wrong with a college lefty from an ACC school -- at least, the A's didn't.</p><p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong>I'm going with Billy Carlson with the 10th pick -- with the admitted caveat that the White Sox haven't exactly been stellar at developing hitters. But Carlson looks like an elite defensive shortstop with plus power, and that alone can make him a valuable major leaguer. If the hit tool comes along, we're looking at a potential star. OK, he's <a data-player-guid=\"953a1c30-3f92-3387-bc26-c4ad94124e87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42403/bobby-witt-jr\">Bobby Witt Jr</a>. lite? That's still an All-Star player.</p><hr><h2>What's your biggest takeaway from Day 1 of this draft?</h2><p><strong>Gonzalez: </strong>The Nationals throwing a wrench into the proceedings by selecting Willits. It was a surprising choice, but in their minds an easy one. Interim general manager Mike DeBartolo called Willits the best hitter and best fielder available. And in a draft devoid of can't-miss, high-impact talent, Willits is no doubt a solid pick -- a polished hitter who should stick at shortstop and might consistently hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases at a premium position. He also might come under slot, allowing flexibility later in the draft. But his selection is what allowed Anderson to reach the Mariners at No. 3 and prompted the Rockies to draft Holliday at No. 4, among other dominoes. It set a really interesting tone.</p><p><strong>Rogers: </strong>Things change quickly in baseball. Whereas college hitters are usually the safest bets early in the draft, this year high school position players dominated. (And they all play shortstop, at least for now.) Athleticism has returned to baseball, and draft rooms are acting accordingly.</p><p><strong>Schoenfield: </strong>I'm agreeing with Jesse. The selection of that many prep shortstops stood out -- and they all seem to hit left-handed and run well, and some of them have big power potential and a cannon for an arm. Look, the hit tool is the most important and the hardest to scout and project, so not all these kids are going to make it, but their potential is exciting and, to Jesse's point, their wide range of tools is showing that baseball is still drawing top athletes to the sport.</p>\n</div></div>"

During Sunday's telecast of the Bucks' summer league game against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAC/los-angeles-clippers/\">Los Angeles Clippers</a>, president Peter Feigin stated that the two sides are in a \"good place\" as they look ahead to the 2025-26 season.</p><p>\"We kind of laugh internally, it's where we've been for 10 years,\" Feigin said during the NBA TV broadcast. \"Giannis loves Milwaukee, Milwaukee loves Giannis. We're in a good place. We feel great about it. It's business as usual. ... We're looking forward to next season.\"</p>\n<p>Back in May, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that Antetokounmpo hadn't made \"any firm decisions\" regarding his future with the Bucks. He admitted interest in \"exploring whether his best long-term fit is remaining in Milwaukee or playing elsewhere.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>However, just one month later, ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported that other <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/teams/\">NBA teams</a> were under the assumption that Antetokounmpo wasn't going to request a trade and Milwaukee preferred not to move him.</p><p>Signs continue to point to Antetokounmpo staying put in Milwaukee for the time being. After all, the Bucks made a huge splash in free agency when the franchise signed former Pacers big man <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2152935/myles-turner/\">Myles Turner</a> to a four-year, $108.8 million contract. Turner recently helped lead the Pacers to an NBA Finals appearance in 2024-25 and averaged 13.8 points and 4.8 rebounds during the team's postseason run.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Antetokounmpo spent his entire 12-year career with the Bucks since being selected with the No. 15 pick in the 2013 <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/draft/\">NBA Draft</a>.

I just think that it's been handled horrifically in our sport. Two world number ones both getting done for doping is disgusting for our sport. It's a horrible look.\"</p><p>In the wake of Sinner's suspension, former British number one Tim Henman claimed the ban was \"too convenient\" and left tennis fans with a \"pretty sour taste\".</p><p>\"When you're dealing with drugs in sport it very much has to be black and white, it's binary, it's positive or negative, you're banned or you're not banned\" he told Sky Sports. </p><p>\"When you start reading words like settlement or agreement, it feels like there's been a negotiation and I don't think that will sit well with the player cohort and the fans of the sport.\" </p><p>Serena Williams <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cwynlqxw2nwo\">said</a> she would have been banned for 20 years and had some of her Grand Slam titles taken away if she had committed the same anti-doping offence as men's world number one Sinner. </p><p>British player Tara Moore, who was provisionally banned for two years while challenging a doping charge of which she was eventually cleared after 19 months, also suggested top players were \"treated differently\", with their image prioritised.</p><p>Accusations of preferential treatment were firmly disputed by the ITIA and Wada, but many believe both players have benefitted from being able to pay top lawyers to act quickly.</p><p>\"A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair,\" said 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. \"It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers.\"</p><p>The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) - an organisation co-founded by Djokovic which aims to increase player power - said there is a lack of \"transparency\", \"process\" and \"consistency\" in the system.</p><p>Three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka, writing on social media, said he did not \"believe in a clean sport any more\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"What-has-been-the-response-to-Swiatek-and-Sinner-winning\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">What has been the response to Swiatek and Sinner winning?</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Former British number one Greg Rusedski seemed to speak for many in the sport when he told BBC Sport: \"I think you have to give them the benefit of the doubt, look at the tennis they have played in this last year, and I think this will all go away in time.\"</p><p>Certainly there seemed little concern from those present at Wimbledon about the backstory of the pair of champions, with the focus on the quality of their play and the ruthlessness of their respective performances.</p><p>Perhaps this should come as no surprise, given that doping controversies are far from unusual in tennis. Indeed, fellow Wimbledon winners Halep, Maria Sharapova, Martina Hingis and Andre Agassi also all had positive drugs tests, albeit after winning the championship, rather than before.</p><p>\"It's a little embarrassing for the sport and, by extension, for Wimbledon, it's a unique and unwelcome double\" says public relations expert Tim Jotischky, of the PHA Group.</p><p>\"However, the evidence suggests that fellow professionals are more upset than the viewing public… the Alcaraz-Sinner rivalry has captured the imagination of sports fans and, whilst Alcaraz is the more popular player, Sinner has never been targeted by spectators.</p><p>\"That might be because many don't follow the sport closely enough to be aware of the details, but the main reason is probably because tennis still looks like a clean sport, where performance-enhancing drugs have a minimum impact, in a way that athletics and cycling often do not.</p><p>\"Iga Swiatek's Wimbledon triumph followed a slump in form… that may have helped divert attention away from her ban.</p><p>\"But tennis cannot be complacent or ignore the concerns of leading professionals.

I don’t see this as pressure. I am just very grateful to be the one from Estonia who happens to be very good at golf.”</p><p>At West Lancashire, Teder leapt for joy after holing his second shot at a par four to seal his Open berth. He shoots back a glance – as in, “don’t be ridiculous” – when asked whether he felt remotely sorry for his two opponents.</p><p>“I have never had anything like that on a golf course,” he recalls. “It was the perfect golf shot; pace was good, dead centre of the cup. It was an unbelievable experience. I thought it would go in after I saw the first bounce, the ball had landed exactly where I wanted and kicked dead straight. I threw my hands up quite early. I semi-blacked out, I couldn’t believe it.”</p><figure id=\"0470a412-995e-4d1f-a8f4-2253fea54a51\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"GuideAtomWrapper\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"visible\" props=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;52b66780-b53d-497e-ba9d-4583df8f2b22&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;BBC to show Open highlights&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>The BBC has secured a last-minute deal to show an early evening highlights programme from The Open Championship in Portrush this week.</p><p>&amp;nbsp;</p><p>The Guardian has learned that the R&amp;amp;A has agreed a new three-year deal with the BBC for highlights for the Open, which also covers the women’s Championship, starting with the 2025 edition at Royal Porthcawl at the end of the month.</p><p>&amp;nbsp;</p><p>The BBC’s late move comes as a surprise and is a boost for the R&amp;amp;A and golf fans, as the corporation has shown little interest in the sport in recent years.

I only managed a few bites then went back to the hotel.”</p><p>All of this is articulated perfectly. Did Teder really master English through the internet? “Yes, that is true,” he says. “I started watching YouTube videos, playing a few games and picked it up from there. I was pretty young, I have been on my phone for quite a while.”</p><p>Teder was a scratch golfer at 13. He shot 64 a year later. His homeland has seven courses and Estonia’s one touring professional, Sander Aadusaar, competes on the Alps Tour.</p><p>“I started golf completely randomly,” Teder says. “I was six. My auntie won a tennis tournament and as a prize she got golf vouchers for 10 people. So my family all got invited. I picked it up right away, thought it was fun … quite easy actually. I started growing when I was 17 and picked up loads of distance. It has been so much easier since then.”</p><p>This requires further exploration. Few people have ever declared that golf is “easy.” Perhaps it is an example of the innocence of youth. “I think people just make it hard, man,” Teder adds. “It is obviously difficult but it is really a mental thing, it is so much to do with what is going on in your head once you get to a level where everyone can hit the ball, putt, chip. Distance is also a huge help and I have been lucky to have natural speed.”</p><figure id=\"bb27f175-c5eb-4e8a-b852-21dbecf0e5e0\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ef1a8d013c572576eaaac38a454e639cf1d111/0_0_4418_2946/master/4418.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ef1a8d013c572576eaaac38a454e639cf1d111/0_0_4418_2946/master/4418.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ef1a8d013c572576eaaac38a454e639cf1d111/0_0_4418_2946/master/4418.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ef1a8d013c572576eaaac38a454e639cf1d111/0_0_4418_2946/master/4418.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ef1a8d013c572576eaaac38a454e639cf1d111/0_0_4418_2946/master/4418.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ef1a8d013c572576eaaac38a454e639cf1d111/0_0_4418_2946/master/4418.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Richard Teder poses with a flag after qualifying for the Open\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ef1a8d013c572576eaaac38a454e639cf1d111/0_0_4418_2946/master/4418.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.7338162064283\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Richard Teder is the first golfer from Estonia to compete at the Open.</span> Photograph: Richard Martin-Roberts/R&amp;A/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Teder is already on a path which could see him earn a card for the HotelPlanner Tour – the DP World Tour’s understudy – by next year. He has no interest in the US college system. “Golf is so time consuming,” he says. “If you try to mix that with school, it just doesn’t add up or make any sense to me.”</p><p>Teder’s seaside experience to date involves competitive rounds at the likes of Royal St George’s, Ballyliffin and Hillside. The scale of the Open will be new to him but the conditions should deliver no shocks. “I have been playing links golf since I was little,” says Teder. “My mum used to take me to kids tournaments in Scotland. Even though I wasn’t very good back then, I always really liked it. I have been playing the British amateur for the last three years and have done pretty well every year there.</p><p>“I am relaxed on links courses, I hit the ball very far and the fairways are pretty firm so it rolls out even more. Somehow I read links greens really well. You have to be creative around the greens with chipping and I think that suits me as well.</p><p>“I will be completely fine. I don’t like the rain much but the wind is no problem. I want to take everything in and have some fun. I am a pretty chilled kid. There will be nerves, we are all human, but all that is important is how I deal with that.”</p></div></div>"

Is it possible that both of their respective teams had become Super Bowl regulars thanks in large part <em>to </em>their presence on the headset? You see, if football is a team sport, then all positions matter, and there's a case to be made that coaches are second only to quarterbacks when it comes to determining the ultimate trajectory of a contender; they, after all, are the ones calling the shots.</p><p>So which of the NFL's head coaches are difference-makers -- for both better and worse? Which ones are cemented as elite shepherds of both rebuilds and title bids? And which ones are under lots of pressure to make the most of their clubs in 2025? Here's our complete ranking of all 32, divided into three tiers, knowing full well these men have a chance to write -- or rewrite -- their own true stories when the games begin this year:</p><h2>Tier 3: Unproven or underwhelming</h2><p><em>As long as these coaches are employed, they have a chance to redeem themselves.

But this is Jerry Jones' show, so it's actually par for the course. Yes, Schottenheimer's name may be bigger than his resume, but this man first held a coordinator job way back in 2006; it's not like he's totally lacking in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> chops. Are we sure there isn't a remote possibility he makes like, say, Doug Pederson -- another former NFC East hire who was overlooked by all except his own team's powerful front office -- and proves to be just the approachable leader Dallas needs?</p><h3>30.

He's only led back-to-back playoff bids with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239997/jordan-love/\">Jordan Love</a> since then, despite half of the supporting cast breaking down in 2024. He could stand to bring a little more bite in the playoffs, but five postseason entries in six tries? The Packers' youth hasn't been an issue but an asset under his lead.</p><h3>7.

No other coach, after all, has guided four NFC title-game appearances in five years, while also overseeing four losing seasons. It's pretty simple here: If his toys are sturdy, he can draw up a shootout with the best of them. Robert Saleh's return as a right-hand man on defense should also help, though Shanahan's also got a conservative bent in the biggest moments.</p><h3>6.

Maybe he's boosted by Howie Roseman collecting premium talent across the board. But you don't shepherd two Super Bowl appearances in three years by accident.

His Ravens have proven more adaptable, leaning into <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jacksons/\">Lamar Jackson's</a> legs while also developing the MVP's aerial efficiency, and they've also parlayed perennial playoff bids into actual postseason victories over the last half-decade. It's fair to question whether he's always got Baltimore locked in until the finish line, considering the club's penchant for blown leads, but you can always count on his group making the dance. It feels like a matter of when, not if, Jackson will help get him over the hump again.</p><h3>2.

McVay is battle-tested thanks to six different playoff runs in eight years, two of which ended in the Super Bowl. He's also energetic enough to cultivate long-term growth; look no further than how quickly the Rams' remade young defense found its footing. Give McVay, who remains a near-unmatched motivator, a competent and/or reasonably healthy quarterback, and you're locked in for a solid January fight.</p><h3>1.

No way. But \"last\" is the key word there; Kansas City has still advanced to five of the last six championship contests under his watch. That's ridiculous, no matter how you slice it. Once the chief of football's most colorful big-play machine, Reid's units have since adapted to win on the margins, with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2142052/patrick-mahomes/\">Patrick Mahomes</a> in particular excelling as more of a situational artist alongside makeshift lineups. Is he perfect? No. Is he aging? Yes. But every roster he fields respects his warm, familial and proven leadership. And every winter, with Mahomes by his side, he's registered as Mr. Inevitable, pushing the Chiefs the extra yard whenever they most need it.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Seattle was the other team taking a long look at Hernandez, but the shenanigans at the top two picks (more on that later) means that both Seattle and Pittsburgh got their preferred arms.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/oak.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>A's select Arnold and Taylor</strong></p><p>The Athletics had only two picks on Day 1 but received excellent values at each. Jamie Arnold was the top prospect in the draft entering the season and seemed primed to go somewhere between No. 2 and No. 8 after an uneven season. He somehow was the prospect left holding the short straw, falling to the 11th pick. Devin Taylor was in the mix at multiple picks in the comp round but lasted five selections into the second round.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/min.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Twins embrace risk with Quick and Young</strong></p><p>The Twins took two hit-first college infielders as their first picks last year (Kaelen Culpepper and Kyle DeBarge), took another one in the 2023 second round (Luke Keaschall), and two more in the top two rounds in 2022 (Brooks Lee, Tanner Schobel) -- and also took one with their first pick this year in Marek Houston.</p><p>What interested me though is what Minnesota did after that, taking big swings with the upside of Riley Quick (four potential plus pitches but below-average command) and Quentin Young (80-grade power potential with big questions on contact rate).</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/phi.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Phillies try to jump the reliever trade market?</strong></p><p>Gage Wood has a chance to start long term but can also go straight to the upper minors -- if not the big leagues -- and potentially help the bullpen later this season, like a trade deadline addition. The Phillies' next pick, Cade Obermueller, is another possible starter who also could move quickly as a lefty turning 22 later this month with two knockout pitches in his fastball/slider combo. Odds are good that at least one of them can provide big league value in the next 12 months if Philly wants to utilize them that way.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bos.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>The Red Sox land Witherspoon, Phillips and Eyanson</strong></p><p>The Red Sox are interested in creating more pitching depth and selected a number of interesting arms on Day 1. Kyson Witherspoon had a lot of interest in the top 10, but the Red Sox got him at No. 15.</p><p>He'll need to sharpen his execution a notch and his short arm action is unique, but there's midrotation upside. Marcus Phillips has a chance to start but could also bring another distinctive look as a late-inning arm with four plus pitches from a low slot and a triple-digit fastball. Anthony Eyanson is a different sort, with fringy fastball velocity but standout command along with a slider and splitter that keep hitters off-balance.</p><h2><strong>Five eye-openers</strong></h2><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/wsh.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Eli Willits at No. 1</strong></p><p>The buzz ahead of the draft was that there were three players in play for the top pick and Willits was my third-ranked player in the class, so the same group is what I would've been considering -- and I love Willits as a player. The bonus will be a factor in evaluating how successful this pick will be viewed -- I'll guess it starts with an eight -- but I think this will be seen as a solid decision, as long as Kade Anderson or Ethan Holliday don't become stars.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Tyler Bremner at No. 2</strong></p><p>The biggest piece of late buzz I was hearing is that Bremner was in play at No. 3 to the Mariners. I didn't hear his name at all at No. 2 so that made this pick the first shocker in the draft.</p><p>Bremner was considered in this area (on a deal) because he could easily be the best pitcher in this class -- but only if he can develop a better slider, which isn't a small if. The Angels seem to have a thought about how to solve this, and how he progresses will be one of the more followed storylines of this draft.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/det.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Tigers take Yost and Oliveto</strong></p><p>I like both players, but it's fascinating that these two and the most-rumored prep hitter tied to Detroit that they didn't take (Coy James, who had a tough summer) were all missing strong 2024 summer performances.</p><p>Jordan Yost and Michael Oliveto were the only two prep position players in the first-round mix who weren't in the major national events on the summer circuit, thus creating a lot of uncertainty about how to project them.</p><p>The Tigers are right to assume this could create a potential quick gain in value if Yost and Oliveto can perform early in their pro careers, but I don't remember seeing a team double down on lack of summer exposure in the early rounds.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/bal.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Orioles take two catchers in the first round, and two pitchers in the second</strong></p><p>It's certainly a bit odd that the Orioles took two college catchers with their first two picks after taking another one (Ethan Anderson) in the second round last year. Obviously, teams don't draft for big league need -- the O's already have Adley Rutschman -- and they need at least two catchers at all four full season minor league affiliates, it's just odd to see them invest in this position early multiple times. And after all of the position players they have drafted under Mike Elias, they did sneak in two arms on Day 1 with Joseph Dzierwa (a command-forward lefty) and J.T. Quinn (one of my favorite college relievers with the traits to start in pro ball).</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cle.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><p><strong>Guardians lean into power</strong></p><p>The Guardians often draft, or sign internationally, hit-first players who are often underpowered, with Steven Kwan a prominent example. They swerved a lot this year, taking Jace LaViolette with their first pick (I compare him to Cody Bellinger or Joey Gallo; he hit .258 this season) and Nolan Schubart (24% strikeout rate, 22% in-zone whiff rate) with their fifth pick on Day 1. Those two have big power and strong pull/lift rates, and LaViolette has the athleticism to play center field, so there's real talent, it's just not usually the type that the Guardians have targeted.</p><hr><h2>Best available for Day 2</h2><p><em>Listed by top 250 draft rankings </em></p><p>43.

Carolina didn't come out on top in that game but it was one of the many where they were battle-tested in the second half of the season leading to valuable experience for Young. Seven of the Panthers' final nine games were decided by one score and four went to overtime.</p>\n<h2>Late-season leap</h2><p>It was a stunning turn of events considering Young was benched after Week 2 of 2024 following a disastrous start to his career. At that point he ranked bottom five among quarterbacks in NFL history in record (2-16), yards per attempt (5.4) and touchdown percentage (1.9%). It was truly rock bottom and so naturally people speculated he could be done with Carolina even though the benching proved to be a quick reset.</p>\n        \n\n<p>He regained the job in Week 8 and steadily showed improvement:</p><ul><li>First 18 career starts: 2-16 record, 12 total TD, 19 turnovers</li><li>Next seven starts: 2-5 record, 10 total TD, eight turnovers</li><li>Last three starts: 2-1 record, 10 total TD, zero turnovers</li></ul><p>Young built momentum from the near upset of the Chiefs until breaking through at the end, becoming the first quarterback since Drew Brees in 2019 with at least 10 total touchdowns and no turnovers in the final three games of the season. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272574/kirk-cousins/\">Kirk Cousins</a> (2015) and Peyton Manning (2006) are the only other quarterbacks to pull that off since 2000. He capped it off by tying a franchise-record with five total touchdowns (three rushing, two passing) in an overtime win in Atlanta in the final week of the regular season.</p><p>The most encouraging part of Young's performance was what we see under the hood. He wasn't dinking and dunking his way down the field. He had the fourth-longest average throw length (9.5 yards downfield) in the final three weeks, coupled with the sixth-lowest off-target rate (8.0%). Only 30% of his passing yards came from YAC in this stretch, the lowest rate in the NFL among quarterbacks to start the final three games. So don't confuse the zero turnovers for not taking risks.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ranking-nfls-10-best-college-turned-pro-teammates-bengals-eagles-among-most-talented-2025-units/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Ranking NFL's 10 best college-turned-pro teammates: Bengals, Eagles among most talented 2025 units</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cody Benjamin                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Ranking NFL's 10 best college-turned-pro teammates: Bengals, Eagles among most talented 2025 units\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2022/02/08/ea4a4d5e-fa9b-42a9-9b91-9d7a383edd8e/thumbnail/270x152/0ccaabafca076ff7267ab18f8a40a32f/burrow-chase.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Other notable cold-to-hot performances</h2><p>So he's in the clear, right? Did the Panthers dodge a major bullet and steer Young from a JaMarcus Russell-level bust to a talented quarterback ready for a breakout season? Not so fast.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Remember the note off the top on how no quarterback went from cold to hot quite like Young? Well, I combed through the most notable hot-and-cold stretches this century and looked for players like Young. Mainly unproven commodities early in their careers who finished the season with a bang. There's mixed results.</p><h3>2008 JaMarcus Russell</h3><ul><li>51% completion, 6.2 yards per attempt, 7 TD, 6 INT in first 12 games</li><li>63% completion, 8.0 yards per attempt, 6 TD, 2 INT in final three games&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Russell is not the first name you want to see on this list if you're Young, but here we are. The former No. 1 overall pick held out before his rookie year in 2007 and only started one game that season. He was dreadful for most of his second season in 2008 before finishing the season with three straight games with multiple touchdown passes. It was fool's gold as he started just nine more games in his career after that brief hot stretch.</p><h3>2008 <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/552470/matt-cassel/\">Matt Cassel</a></h3><ul><li>200 pass yards per game, 7 TD, 7 INT in first nine games&nbsp;</li><li>270 pass yards per game, 14 TD, 4 INT in final eight games&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Matt Cassel took over for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/187741/tom-brady/\">Tom Brady</a> in 2008 after Brady tore his ACL in the season opener. He got off to a slow start before throwing 14 touchdown passes and four interceptions in his last seven games. It was a good enough showcase for the Chiefs to trade for Cassel the following offseason, but he only had one more productive season for the rest of his career.</p>\n        \n\n<h3>2013 <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a></h3><ul><li>11 total TD, 23 turnovers in first 12 games&nbsp;</li><li>7 total TD, two turnovers in final four games</li></ul><p>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ... Geno Smith was a struggling rookie QB with 11 total touchdowns and 23 turnovers in his first 12 career games. This was way back in 2013. He improved down the stretch winning three of his final four starts of the year. Smith did not pick up where he left off, making just 14 more starts in his <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> career.&nbsp;</p><h3>2015 Kirk Cousins</h3><ul><li>7.3 yards per attempt, 18 pass TD, 11 INT in first 13 games</li><li>9.7 yards per attempt, 10 pass TD, 0 INT in final three games</li></ul><p>Cousins eventually stepped out of Robert Griffin III's shadow and broke out in his fourth season, finishing the year with 10 touchdown passes and no interceptions in his final three games. Cousins has made $287 million since that year. Safe to say he did OK for himself.</p><h3>2018 <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a></h3><ul><li>56% completion, 12 pass TD, 15 INT in first 10 games</li><li>63% completion, 5 pass TD, 0 INT in final three games</li></ul><p>Sam Darnold followed the Smith plan. He offered the Jets some hope with a nice run at the end of his rookie year but quickly played his way out of town after that. Like Smith, it took Darnold a few more stops to break out.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h3>2021 <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867381/davis-mills/\">Davis Mills</a></h3><ul><li>66% completion, 6.4 yards per attempt, 10 pass TD, 9 INT in first eight games&nbsp;</li><li>71% completion, 7.8 yards per attempt, 6 pass TD, 1 INT in final three games&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Davis Mills finished strong in his rookie year of 2021 filling in for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2133482/deshaun-watson/\">Deshaun Watson</a>. He played well enough to win the job in 2022 after Watson was traded. That obviously didn't last long as Houston drafted <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-stroud/\">C.J. Stroud</a> in 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3>2023 <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239997/jordan-love/\">Jordan Love</a></h3><ul><li>59% completion, 14 pass TD, 10 INT in first nine games</li><li>70% completion, 18 pass TD, INT in last eight games</li></ul><p>Jordan Love was the biggest mystery in the NFL in 2023 after taking over for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a>. A lot of question marks remained after his erratic play through nine games before cooking with 18 touchdown passes and one interception in his final eight games of the season. He hasn't looked back since.&nbsp;</p><h2>What's next for Young?</h2><p>There's no set path to stardom. Some of those \"breakouts\" proved to be a mirage, the product of a small sample, while others were just the beginning.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>One thing working in Young's favor is a pair of potential playmakers. The Panthers drafted <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3131575/xavier-legette/\">Xavier Legette</a> (6-feet-3, 227 pounds) in the first round in 2024 and then took <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28877124/tetairoa-mcmillan/\">Tetairoa McMillan</a> (6-5, 210 pounds) eighth overall in 2025. McMillan could be a true WR1 for the Panthers after Legette failed to emerge as Young's top target last season.&nbsp;</p><p>The addition of a star wide receiver has been the difference for a few young quarterback breakouts in recent years, including <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2181054/josh-allen/\">Josh Allen</a> (with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000038/stefon-diggs/\">Stefon Diggs</a>), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> (with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966320/jamarr-chase/\">Ja'Marr Chase</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> (with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-brown/\">A.J. Brown</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>The Panthers are betting that McMillan can speed up Young's development and ensure that last season's hot stretch was not a one-hit wonder.</p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

His swing is perfect for the Derby: He leads MLB this season in both pull percentage and fly ball percentage, so it's not as if he needs to recalibrate it to succeed. He has also become a prolific hitter from the right side this season -- 16 home runs in 102 at-bats -- and his ability to switch between right- and left-handed pitching offers a potential advantage. No switch-hitter (or catcher for that matter) has won a Home Run Derby. The Big Dumper is primed to be the first, beating Buxton in the finals.</p><p><strong>Alden Gonzalez</strong>: Cruz. He might be wildly inconsistent at this point in his career, but he is perfect for the Derby -- young enough to possess the stamina required for a taxing event that could become exhausting in the Atlanta heat; left-handed, in a ballpark where the ball carries out better to right field; and, most importantly, capable of hitting balls at incomprehensible velocities. Raleigh will put on a good show from both sides of the plate but will come in second.</p><p><strong>Buster Olney</strong>: Olson. He is effectively pinch-hitting for Acuna, and because he received word in the past 72 hours of his participation, he hasn't had the practice rounds that the other competitors have been going through. But he's the only person in this group who has done the Derby before, which means he has experienced the accelerated pace, adrenaline and push of the crowd.</p><p>His pitcher, Eddie Perez, knows something about performing in a full stadium in Atlanta. And, as Olson acknowledged in a conversation Sunday, the park generally favors left-handed hitters because of the larger distances that right-handed hitters must cover in left field.</p><p><strong>Jesse Rogers: </strong>Olson. Home-field advantage will mean something this year as hitting in 90-plus degree heat and humidity will be an extra challenge in Atlanta. Olson understands that and can pace himself accordingly. Plus, he was a late addition. He has got nothing to lose. He'll outlast the young bucks in the field. And I'm not putting Raleigh any lower than second -- his first half screams that he'll be in the finals against Olson.</p><p><strong>Jorge Castillo: </strong>Wood. His mammoth power isn't disputed -- he can jack baseballs to all fields. But the slight defect in his power package is that he doesn't hit the ball in the air nearly as often as a typical slugger. Wood ranks 126th out of 155 qualified hitters across the majors in fly ball percentage. And he <em>still</em> has swatted 24 home runs this season. So, in an event where he's going to do everything he can to lift baseballs, hitting fly balls won't be an issue, and Wood is going to show off that gigantic power en route to a victory over Cruz in the finals.</p><hr><h2>Who will hit the longest home run of the night -- and how far?</h2><p><strong>Passan</strong>: Cruz hits the ball harder than anyone in baseball history. He's the choice here, at 493 feet.</p><p><strong>Gonzalez</strong>: If you exclude the Coors Field version, there have been just six Statcast-era Derby home runs that have traveled 497-plus feet. They were compiled by two men: <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"85fd807f-1324-d722-3965-eece0c5ad858\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30583/giancarlo-stanton\">Giancarlo Stanton</a>. James Wood -- all 6-foot-7, 234 pounds of him -- will become the third.</p><p><strong>Olney</strong>: James Wood has the easy Stanton- and Judge-type power, and he will clear the Chophouse with the longest homer. Let's say 497 feet.</p><p><strong>Rogers</strong>: Hopefully he doesn't injure himself doing it, but Buxton will break out his massive strength and crush a ball at least 505 feet. I don't see him advancing far in the event, but for one swing, he'll own the night.</p><p><strong>Castillo</strong>: Cruz hits baseballs hard and far. He'll crush a few bombs, and one will reach an even 500 feet.</p><hr><h2>Who is the one slugger fans will know much better after the Derby?</h2><p><strong>Passan</strong>: Buxton capped his first half with a cycle on Saturday, and he'll carry that into the Derby, where he will remind the world why he was baseball's No. 1 prospect in 2015. Buxton's talent has never been in question, just his health. And with his body feeling right, he has the opportunity to put on a show fans won't soon forget.</p><p><strong>Olney</strong>: Caminero isn't a big name and wasn't a high-end prospect like Wood was earlier in his career. Just 3½ years ago, Caminero was dealt to the Rays by the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6ad8fa03-36bc-baab-c76a-345b6544424d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-guardians\">Cleveland Guardians</a> in a relatively minor November trade for pitcher <a data-player-guid=\"8f0265ac-013f-2e58-3e69-69c73510cd04\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39716/tobias-myers\">Tobias Myers</a>. But since then, he has refined his ability to cover inside pitches and is blossoming this year into a player with ridiculous power. He won't win the Derby, but he'll open some eyes.</p><hr><h2>What's the one moment we'll all be talking about long after this Derby ends?</h2><p><strong>Gonzalez</strong>: The incredible distances and velocities that will be reached, particularly by Wood, Cruz, Caminero, Raleigh and Buxton. The hot, humid weather at Truist Park will only aid the mind-blowing power that will be on display Monday night.</p><p><strong>Rogers</strong>: The exhaustion on the hitter's faces, swinging for home run after home run in the heat and humidity of Hot-lanta!</p><p><strong>Castillo</strong>: Cruz's 500-foot blast and a bunch of other lasers he hits in the first two rounds before running out of gas in the finals.</p>\n</div></div>"

That's kind of what makes it so great, right?\"</p><p>It's July 5, the day after Raleigh celebrated another home run with fireworks with some teammates in South Lake Union, a mile from the Space Needle and 3 miles from T-Mobile Park, where Raleigh has spent 2025 doing things never done by a catcher in 150 years of major league baseball. Raleigh's numbers heading into this week's All-Star break elucidate the magnitude of his achievements -- 38 home runs, 1.022 OPS, 81 RBIs, all in just 92 games -- but it's the names he's chasing that give them gravitas. With 66 games left this season, Raleigh is threatening to break Mickey Mantle's single-season home run record for a switch-hitter (54) and Ken Griffey Jr.'s single-season home run record for a Mariner (56). He fell one shy of Barry Bonds' record for first-half home runs (39).</p><p>\"At the beginning of the year, it was like, all right, he is off to a great start,\" said <a data-player-guid=\"b7e723ac-844e-37c9-9543-0c85fb5cc5e2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4629089/bryan-woo\">Bryan Woo</a>, the Mariners' All-Star right-hander and Raleigh's roommate last year. \"And then he just kept going and it was like, wow, this is pretty cool. And then it was like, holy s---, he's going off. And now it's kind of just like, what is going on? Over the last month, I feel like everybody realized it's a historic season. It's not just a really good one or one of the best in the league -- it's something that's never been done. At this point, most guys are just kind of looking at each other every time he hits a homer or has a really good game. We don't really know what to make of it. We're kind of just as dumbfounded as all the fans are.\"</p><p>Raleigh's emergence as a legitimate threat to what once looked like a runaway American League MVP campaign by <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2b9cedf3-ce60-0bcf-fafe-8cd055255685\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a> star <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a> has thrust Seattle's secret -- a switch-hitting, upper deck-hunting, Platinum Glove-winning, every day-playing, badonkadonk-jiggling folk hero -- into the national spotlight. The latest turn comes <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45576753/2025-mlb-all-star-game-schedule-how-watch-rosters\">Monday night in Atlanta at 8 p.m.</a>, when the 28-year-old Raleigh will try to become the first switch-hitter and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45583704/mlb-2025-all-star-home-run-derby-bracket-analysis-participants\">first catcher to win the Home Run Derby</a>.</p><p>Todd Raleigh, his father and a longtime college coach, will throw the pitches Raleigh intends to send over the fence. Squatting behind the plate will be his 15-year-old brother, Todd Jr., privy to the best view at Truist Park. That this moment turned into a Raleigh family affair is poetic. If not for his father -- for the long legacy of Raleighs in baseball forged in the unlikeliest of places -- the Big Dumper wouldn't be here.</p><hr><p><strong>LONG BEFORE HE</strong> showed up at T-Mobile Park at noon, <a data-player-guid=\"6c27dcb5-a741-d526-b5ac-f3988e288a70\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41292/cal-raleigh\">Cal Raleigh</a> took a yellow school bus to get his daily baseball fix. He would leave Cullowee Valley Elementary at 3:10 p.m., ride about a mile to Hennon Stadium, change into a Western Carolina University uniform and watch his dad work.</p><p>Todd Raleigh grew up in Swanton, Vermont, where his family was baseball royalty. His oldest brother, John, won two state titles at Missisquoi Valley Union High before dying a year after graduation of lymphoma. The middle Raleigh brother, Matt, captured three state championships and twice hit more than 30 home runs in a minor league season, topping out at Triple-A. With a pair of state championships on his résumé, Todd wanted to go to Western Carolina, so he hitchhiked down the East Coast, made the team and thrived. When he returned as a coach, he found a new home.</p><p>In his firstborn, Todd found a kindred spirit. Raleigh's love of baseball manifested itself relentlessly. At the grocery store, he pantomimed swings in the aisles. At home, he emulated the stances of every Catamounts player. When he was home sick, Raleigh would draw diagrams of uniforms. He gave lineup suggestions to Todd. In a home video taken when he was 8 years old, Raleigh sang: \"I'm the Home Run Derby champ. I'm the Home Run Derby champ.\"</p><p>Before Raleigh entered fifth grade, Todd's success at Western Carolina earned him the head coaching job at the University of Tennessee, one of the country's premier college programs. In Knoxville, Raleigh encountered the first challenges to his love of the game. He got cut from his middle-school team. Todd, who had recruited <a data-player-guid=\"84b5fdeb-d79c-dc9c-8023-5cad2a921ca4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts\">Mookie Betts</a> to play for the Volunteers only to see him sign with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6df06f6-785d-3900-4935-5fd13742e2ee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a> out of high school, got fired after four seasons. At Knoxville Catholic, a coach told Raleigh he was a Division III talent. As he fumed, Todd offered him some advice: \"Get so much better that you can't be told no.\" The family returned to North Carolina, and Raleigh broke out at Smoky Mountain High. He went to Florida State and was named a freshman All-American. Following a sophomore slump, he thrived as a junior, hitting 13 home runs and walking more than he struck out. Scouts loved his power from both sides of the plate but worried that at 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds, he wasn't athletic enough to remain at catcher and recommended a move to first base.</p><p>Raleigh refused. Their eyes were the issue, not his skills. Six catchers went ahead of him in the 2018 draft. Seattle plucked Raleigh with the 90th pick in the draft, hopeful a third-rounder could evolve into a big leaguer. When Raleigh arrived at Low-A Everett that year, Tony Arnerich, the Mariners' field coordinator and catching instructor, watched one session of him catching and admitted to being surprised.</p><p>\"You're nothing like what I expected, what everybody said you were,\" Arnerich said.</p><p>\"Well, what did they say?\" Raleigh responded.</p><p>They said the sorts of things Raleigh had already spent years repurposing into motivation. He'd been told he wasn't good enough in sixth grade. Or high school. Or college. He was a switch-hitter who, despite almost even splits against right- and left-handed pitching, was advised to pick one side to hit from, because if he were intent on catching, the job was too demanding to bifurcate time spent on swinging. Even after Raleigh thrived in his debut season in Seattle's farm system, hit 29 home runs in his second year and outhit everyone at the team's minor league alternate site in 2020, he never came close to a top 100 prospect list. In an organization with <a data-player-guid=\"b4376163-318a-7510-fe79-bbb7ee9acf0d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41044/julio-rodriguez\">Julio Rodriguez</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"70558f21-da31-ecfb-c1ea-081e98803626\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41221/logan-gilbert\">Logan Gilbert</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"1a5ac7a8-3d43-3bba-ac79-580f0a46e25f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42406/george-kirby\">George Kirby</a> and Jarred Kelenic hoarding all the attention, Raleigh always registered as an afterthought.</p><p>Raleigh joined Gilbert and Kelenic on Seattle's big league roster in July 2021, with <a href=\"https://x.com/jarredkelenic/status/1414285412491698177\">Kelenic introducing to the masses</a> the nickname he had given Raleigh in the minor leagues. The Big Dumper was a big disappointment, unable to muster even a .200 batting average. The 2022 season was worse. Following an April of inconsistent playing time, batting .083/.214/.208, Raleigh was shipped back to AAA.</p><p>\"I wasn't sure that he was going to stick around,\" Gilbert said, \"much less turn into what he is today.\"</p><p>Raleigh wasn't sure, either. Growing up, he had heard his father talk about the major leagues with reverence. There was Low-A, High-A, Double-A and Triple-A. The big leagues, Todd said, were Eight-A, exponentially harder than the minors, and they had humbled Raleigh to the point of sulking, something Todd refused to oblige.</p><p>\"I was just angry at the world,\" Raleigh said. \"I was mad, I was upset, I wasn't playing as much as I would've liked, I wasn't playing well. A lot of complaining. He sat me down and was like, 'Hey, you don't realize how lucky you are to be where you're at. You know, this is what you dreamed of your whole life, and you're sitting here complaining about it, and you're not doing anything about it.' And it really changed my perspective on a lot of things. I started looking at things through a different lens. It was something I needed that I didn't know I needed.\"</p><p>The Mariners gave Raleigh a 48-hour window to report to Triple-A Tacoma. He showed up a day early, batted third in the lineup, went 0-for-4, called Todd and said: \"I'm never going back down again.\" Raleigh needed to work on his ability to compartmentalize, Todd told him, not just separating his duties as a catcher from those as a hitter but his bad days from the chaos they sowed in his mind.</p><p>\"Cal is a processor,\" Todd said. \"It takes him a couple days to consider something and understand it. Eventually, he comes around.\"</p><p>Raleigh saw the wisdom in Todd's advice. He needed to clear his head, so he took walks in the morning, sometimes seeking refuge in nearby churches. He found the swings that had disappeared. He shed the malaise, ditched the attitude and poured his energy into the work -- the early arrivals, the meticulous preparation, the game within the game. Barely a week after Raleigh's demotion, Mariners catcher <a data-player-guid=\"679ff476-5598-54cb-5f35-5dbd4d0a403c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33225/tom-murphy\">Tom Murphy</a> separated his left shoulder, prompting Seattle to recall the debugged version of Raleigh.</p><p>After five hitless games that collapsed his batting average to .065, Raleigh hunted a fastball from <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> reliever <a data-player-guid=\"9f22bb2f-30a7-f947-d8ef-874449f6e090\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39685/drew-smith\">Drew Smith</a> and parked it 435 feet onto the right-field concourse at Citi Field, a titanic shot that reminded him of his capabilities. Raleigh homered again three days later. And again five days after that. He went deep six more times in June and was a menace behind the plate, on his way to throwing out an AL-best 25 attempted base stealers.</p><p>\"I don't care how touted you are,\" Todd said. \"If there's a crack in your character, a crack in your work ethic, a physical flaw, you're going to get exposed.\"</p><p>Raleigh was the one doing the exposing. With Murphy out for the season, he assumed full-time catching duties and racked up 25 home runs as Seattle surged toward its first postseason berth in 21 years, the longest drought in major North American men's professional sports. Out of the lineup on Sept. 30, 2022, a day after catching all 188 pitches of an 11-inning game, he entered in the ninth inning as a pinch hitter.</p><p>The game was tied 1-1, with a win needed to seal the Mariners' spot in the postseason. Raleigh worked the count against Oakland right-hander Domingo Acevedo full and fouled off the sixth pitch of the at-bat. Fans around the stadium stood, hoping to conjure the halcyon days of Griffey and Edgar Martinez and Randy Johnson, the three Hall of Famers who brought aura to Seattle baseball but never a World Series appearance. Acevedo left a slider over the plate, low and inside. Raleigh loosed his bat. The ball surged into the night, ricocheted off a window of the Hit It Here Café in right field and, for an instant, at least, nearly a half-century of Mariners failures vanished. Of all the consequential hits in Mariners history -- Ichiro Suzuki breaking Rogers Hornsby's single-season hit record, Martinez's double that scored Griffey from first in the 1995 division series against the Yankees -- none landed with the euphoric release of Raleigh's walk-off. It was a bloodletting and a portent.</p><p>Raleigh wasn't just a part of the Mariners' future; he was a foundational element. He played in 145 games the next year -- second most in the league -- and hit 30 home runs. Last year, he bumped his homer total to 34 and logged 153 games, a rarely seen figure for a catcher made even more impressive by his predilection to play through injuries. When he hit the walk-off in 2022, Raleigh was playing with a broken left thumb that had a torn ligament. Gilbert saw him play through a burst blood vessel in his eye and an ear gushing blood after getting struck on a backswing.</p><p>\"That's what really does it for me,\" Gilbert said. \"Love the homers, love how you play, all that kind of stuff. When you're banged up and you don't say a word and go out there, I'm like, 'OK, this guy's a gamer.' Every game he's back there, he takes a foul ball. Like, 'Oh, that one looked bad. OK, it's been like 20 seconds -- maybe he's milking it.' You forget about it. And then you go in the training room and there's a huge black-and-purple spot on his thigh or wherever it is, and you're like, 'OK, he was actually pretending nothing happened, not milking it.' I wouldn't be able to walk.\"</p><p>Putting Humpty Dumper back together again takes treatment of all manner and variety. Ice, heat, massage, stimulation. One night, Mariners general manager Justin Hollander walked into the training room to see acupuncture needles all over Raleigh's body, as if he were trying to cosplay Pinhead.</p><p>\"And the next morning,\" Hollander said, \"there's one person there before everyone, sitting in the cafeteria with a stack of advance papers: Cal.\"</p><p>In the work and the triumph it cultivated, Raleigh had validated his promise never to return to Triple-A. He didn't just belong. He embodied the big in big leagues. He was turning into something new -- more self-assured, more capable, the sort of character onto whom Seattle could latch with no reservation.</p><hr><p><strong>IN SEATTLE'S OPENING</strong> series this year, a between-innings video with Cal Raleigh's deadpan face flashed on the scoreboard. From commercials to vignettes to promotions, no team in baseball does entertainment with as much creative flair as the Mariners. Even for them this pushed the envelope of absurdity. The premise was simple: Send an email to bigdumper@mariners.com, and Raleigh will help you dump a problematic person in your life.</p><p>\"Tom, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but it's not working with Lindsay,\" Raleigh said. \"Don't worry, though. When one door closes, another one opens. Specifically, a door to a new apartment, because your current lease is in Lindsay's name. Bummer.\"</p><p>Even if it was a bit -- the Mariners have received real requests at the email address for boyfriends, girlfriends, friends and others, although not one of them was from Lindsay -- it illustrated the full commodification of the Big Dumper persona by the Mariners and the full embrace of it by Raleigh. Baseball had seen the Big Train (Walter Johnson), the Big Hurt (Frank Thomas), the Big Unit (Randy Johnson) and dozens more Bigs. Never had one been assigned on account of thiccness alone.</p><p>\"It's not the one you write up in your mind when you're thinking of nicknames,\" Raleigh said. \"But, I mean ... it's true. That's who I am.\"</p><p>Raleigh's was the posterior that kept on giving, offering an endless supply of promotions that helped burrow him into the psyche of a wounded fan base. Instead of \"RALEIGH\" running across the nameplate of replica jerseys, the Mariners sell a No. 29 jersey that says \"BIG DUMPER.\" They made Big Dumper onesies and sold out almost immediately. He filmed a commercial for Big Dumper Trucking, a company that does not exist.</p><p>\"Part of what makes Cal so lovable is he's an everyman,\" said Jerry Dipoto, the Mariners' president of baseball operations. \"He's blue collar. Shows up in his truck. Does his job. That's the beauty of him. He's not flashy. He's not boisterous. He's not there to create his own brand. He's been almost embarrassed by all the attention he's received.\"</p><p>Connecting with Seattle mattered to Raleigh. Last year, he meandered outside of T-Mobile to a stage where fans were getting their heads shaved by Jay Buhner, the slugging outfielder of the team's 1990s glory days. For 30 years, Buhner Buzz Cut night entitled people willing to sport Buhner's signature chrome-dome look to a T-shirt and free ticket to a Mariners game. Off came Raleigh's locks, courtesy of Buhner.</p><p>The Mariners sold a Cal-Zone calzone at concession stands and replaced it this year with Lil' Dumpers soup dumplings. They take advantage of Raleigh's sense of humor (a video of him and Gilbert asking each other questions when hooked up to a polygraph is laced with laugh-out-loud moments) and his trust in them (they once convinced Raleigh that a slow-motion camera was broken, so he needed to move -- and yell -- in slow motion). They renamed right field the Dump Yard for a night. \"We thought about calling the people sitting in the section the Dumplings,\" said Gregg Greene, the Mariners' longtime marketing guru, \"but we realized that's probably not a great name for our fans.\"</p><p>By the time All-Star voting commenced this year, the Mariners urged fans to \"Be a Peach, Vote Cal,\" using a fruit emoji to secure votes. At one point, they put together an all-booty-song walk-up playlist, including \"Baby Got Back\" by Seattle native Sir Mix-A-Lot for Raleigh. He finished with the second-most votes in the AL behind Judge.</p><p>When he walks around Seattle and gets recognized, fans typically don't yell his name. It's almost always \"Dumper.\" And as advantageous as an ample derriere can be for baseball players -- the lower half of a swing generates power, not the upper half -- its drawbacks occasionally reveal themselves. On the night of the ceremony in which Raleigh won the Seattle Sports Commission's men's Sports Star of the Year award in late February, the fly on his suit pants got stuck. He asked the front desk of the hotel in which he was staying for safety pins. They didn't help. A nearby Men's Wearhouse agreed to stay open late to accommodate Raleigh. Finding a pair of off-the-rack pants that fit was a lost cause. Eventually, he settled on a pair of jeans and apologized to the crowd at the event for his lack of formal attire due to \"a zipper incident.\"</p><p>They laughed, and they cheered, and they reminded Raleigh why he had been open to signing a long-term contract with the franchise. The Mariners had approached Raleigh in the 2023-24 offseason about a deal. He demurred. At the winter meetings in December 2024, Dipoto and Hollander broached the topic again and were told to table it until spring training. The team sent a proposal early in the spring. Before he considered it, Raleigh said, he needed to learn more about the future of the franchise.</p><p>The Mariners have arguably the best farm system in baseball, but they consistently rank in the middle of the pack in money spent on players, never carrying a payroll that exceeds $158 million into the season. Following a spring training workout, Raleigh -- still in full uniform -- met Dipoto and Hollander in a suite at the team's Arizona facility. He wanted to understand more about the Mariners' future: the minor leaguers, the front office's philosophies, how the competition in the AL West projects. He carried a notebook filled with questions and started firing away.</p><p>What are prospects' timelines? How is the roster evolving? Are Gilbert and Kirby and Woo and right-handers <a data-player-guid=\"f862027a-e64c-3576-3bea-85dad3d5b39f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35124/luis-castillo\">Luis Castillo</a> and Bryce Miller going to be on this team as free agency approaches? Or will the team trade them to start the cycle that has kept Tampa Bay and Milwaukee consistently in the playoff mix? Because, Raleigh said, if this group stays together, it can win a World Series. They spoke for 2½ hours, and the answers were clearly satisfactory, because soon thereafter Raleigh agreed to a six-year, $105 million context extension that can keep him in a Mariners uniform through 2031.</p><p>\"Cal wants to win,\" Dipoto said. \"He wants to eat your face off. He's an intense competitor. Cal says a lot without saying much.\"</p><hr><p><strong>WHAT RALEIGH WILL</strong> say is that all of this happened for a reason. Getting cut and being told what he can't be and struggling and hearing the hard truth from his father led him to the point where he can find the best version of himself -- where Cal Raleigh steps into a Mariners uniform, like Clark Kent in a phone booth, and becomes the Big Dumper, punisher of baseballs. It's freeing, really, allowing him to look beyond today and toward goals bigger than him.</p><p>\"Now that I've kind of established myself in the league and learned I can be an everyday catcher, I can hit, I can call a game, I can do all these things, you start turning your attention to: All right, now I want to win a World Series,\" Raleigh said. \"I got my contract. Now I really want to deliver for these fans, for my family, for myself to prove that I can do this. That's what drives me and consumes me.\"</p><p>As gratifying as individual achievements can be, Raleigh is wholly unconcerned with how he stacks up to Judge in the MVP race. He acknowledged that being on the field for the Home Run Derby with his father and brother is more important to him than winning it. He finds more fulfillment in group success, starting with this Mariners team, which at times looks like it can win a championship and at others like another disappointment.</p><p>Raleigh is determined to do his part to avoid the fates of the 2023 and 2024 Mariners teams. His defense is still elite, from arm to blocking to framing. The bat is calibrated toward his strengths, with the second-highest fly ball rate of any hitter in the pitch-tracking era (57.1%) and a pull rate that ranks 25th out of the 3,500-plus qualified seasons, according to FanGraphs. The durability is unparalleled: only two days off in the first half. And the leadership, long a work in progress, is coming into its own: Raleigh now wields the microphone on the team plane and bus, a role given to the steward of each team.</p><p>Sometimes it gets awkward, Raleigh's inherent sheepishness exposing itself. When he was named an All-Star starter, the first thing he did was apologize to the team for the hullabaloo around him. \"It's not the same anymore,\" Raleigh said, and he's right. Hit 38 home runs in the first half and it's not going to be. He said the same to Todd recently, and his father responded in his inimitable fashion.</p><p>\"I said, 'Well, wah, wah, wah. This is a privilege, right? Do you want to not be in there? I'll trade with you. How's that?'\" Todd said. \"He gets it. You just gotta learn to deal with it.\"</p><p>So he learns. And he grows. And he shows up at noon, always ready to put in a good day's work, loving every last moment.</p>\n</div></div>"

He led the league in those same two metrics in 2018 as well with 1,434 yards rushing on 304 carries a couple years later.&nbsp;</p><p>After Pro Bowler <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2184011/tony-pollard/\">Tony Pollard</a> held down the starting job in 2023 once Dallas moved on from Elliott, Dallas' run game struggled to find its footing for much of the 2024 season after Pollard left to become a Tennessee Titan. Elliott's Cowboys homecoming didn't boost the Dallas run game, as the team averaged the second-fewest rushing yards per game (81.7) through the first 11 weeks of the season with its running back-by-committee approach.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Once then-head coach Mike McCarthy put the undrafted <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252798/rico-dowdle/\">Rico Dowdle</a> in as the Cowboys' lead back, he thrived: his 677 yards rushing from Weeks 12-18 in 2024 were the fourth-most in the NFL, trailing only <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> (868), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866395/jonathan-taylor/\">Jonathan Taylor</a> (758) and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061188/derrick-henry/\">Derrick Henry</a> (736) in that span. Dowdle finished the year with a career-high 1,079 yards rushing, which made him the first undrafted running back to break 1,000 yards in a season in Cowboys history.&nbsp;</p><p>General manager Jerry Jones opted to let the 27-year-old Dowdle walk in free agency as he signed a one-year deal with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a>. Jones, for now, has filled the running back depth chart for new head coach Brian Schottenheimer's first season in charge with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961719/javonte-williams/\">Javonte Williams</a> (signed a one-year, $3 million deal after four seasons with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a>), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251305/miles-sanders/\">Miles Sanders</a> (signed a one-year, $1.34 million contract after the worst year of his career with the Carolina Panthers in 2024), rookie <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28875227/jaydon-blue/\">Jaydon Blue</a> (a 2025 fifth-round pick) and rookie <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695049/phil-mafah/\">Phil Mafah</a> (a 2025 seventh-round pick).&nbsp;</p><p>\"The strange thing about the running back position is you really don't find out about them  until you get out to Oxnard,\" Schottenheimer said on the third and final day of the 2025 NFL Draft. \"Running around out there in shorts is a little bit different than  running through&nbsp;330-pound defensive linemen who are keeping their arms out and linebackers filling holes and  linebackers are blitzing through the A gap and things like that. But I will say this, we feel like through this offseason, we  have built an incredibly strong running back room.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>CBS Sports followed up with Schottenheimer and asked where things stand in Dallas' running back room on the last day of mandatory minicamp on June 12, so here's a look at the pecking order ahead of one of the Cowboys' biggest training camp battles this summer before players report on July 21.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/dak-prescott-is-fully-healthy-and-hell-have-the-most-talent-rich-cowboys-ol-in-years-protecting-him/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Dak Prescott is fully healthy, and he'll have the 'most talent-rich' Cowboys OL in years protecting him</p>\n                <p>\n                    Garrett Podell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Dak Prescott is fully healthy, and he'll have the 'most talent-rich' Cowboys OL in years protecting him\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/10/c9ef142f-eb56-44fa-9808-c1edc36ca899/thumbnail/270x152/946075297f792ca678025341f04fe04f/dak-prescott.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Veterans</h2>\n<p>The first running back Schottenheimer mentioned was Williams, a 2021 second-round pick by the Broncos.&nbsp;</p><p>He got off to a promising start as a rookie before getting sidetracked in 2022 by tearing his ACL and MCL. That sapped the explosiveness he was known for in college at North Carolina and as a rookie in Denver. Williams' 4.4 yards per touch across the last four seasons is the third-fewest in the NFL (minimum 750 touches) and ahead of only Elliott's 4.1 yards per touch and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741200/najee-harris/\">Najee Harris</a>' 4.3 yards per touch in that span.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>He was the Broncos' leading rusher in 2024 with 513 yards and four rushing touchdowns on 139 carries (3.7 yards per carry), but it wasn't individually a noteworthy season for a Denver squad that reached the playoffs for the first time since winning Super Bowl 50 in the 2015 season.&nbsp;</p><p>However, nearly three years removed from his knee injury, Williams has grabbed Schottenheimer's attention after a strong offseason program and enters training camp as the initial RB1.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I'll start with Javonte. I can't say enough great things about him: the way he practices, the way he approaches practice,\" Schottenheimer said on June 12. \"You guys know I love the word 'the intentionality.' I think that's for a younger player. A couple years in, he's figured it out. I don't know, I never asked him, I should ask him 'who did you learn from?' because somebody taught him how to practice. He's awesome with that. ... You feel the veteran side of both of those guys [Williams and Sanders] like they're veterans. They know how to work, they know how to prepare.\"&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Williams' ability to pick up the nuances of Schottenheimer's offense quickly, especially in pass protection, has the first-year head coach especially fired up.&nbsp;</p><p>\"It's funny,\" Schottenheimer said June 12. \"I was talking, I was calling a play to Dak, and I was telling [him] to remind Javonte (about something). I said, 'Hey remind Javonte,' and [Prescott] kind of looked at me and said, 'He's a valedictorian.' Javonte looked back and smiled.\"</p>\n<p>Sanders was the second running back Schottenheimer mentioned.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Miles has been great as well,\" Schottenheimer said June 12. &nbsp;</p><p>The 28-year-old broke out for career-highs in carries (259), yards rushing (1,269) and rushing touchdowns (11) during the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>' 2022 NFC championship-winning season, but it's been a struggle for Sanders since leaving Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>He signed a four-year, $25.4 million contract with the Panthers in 2023 but was released from the deal after struggling to catch on with former No. 1 pick&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3161957/bryce-young/\">Bryce Young</a> going through growing pains in his transition to the NFL. Sanders produced just 637 yards rushing and four touchdowns on 104 carries in 27 games played the last two seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he stood out early in Dallas' offseason program, especially by making big plays in the passing game out of the backfield, hauling in multiple, deep contested catches down the right sideline in a few organized team activities (OTAs) and minicamp practices.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I don't know why anyone would be surprised by Miles' ability,\" Schottenheimer said practice on June 3. \"Having been in the division and playing against Miles when he was in Philadelphia, you talk about a guy that's a home-run threat, a guy that's got incredible ability to hurt you running, catching out of the backfield, all that stuff. Very smart, very bright. All of the backs have been that way.\"</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Rookies</h2>\n\n<p>It's very clear Blue and Mafah will need to stand out in a big way in training camp in order to be a part of Schottenheimer's running back rotation in 2025. Throughout the offseason, he indicated there's a noticeable learning curve his rookie rushers have to overcome to get regular work with the first-team offense.&nbsp;</p><p>\"There's something to these veteran players (Williams and Sanders) that does help, and they've been great because they've been helping Jaydon and Phil,\" Schottenheimer said June 12. \"Those two young guys have a lot to learn in a good way.</p><p>\"They're used to, most college guys are, they get to the line of scrimmage really fast, and they look over and they look for what, signs. There are guys holding up boards and signs and signals and things like that. Now, they're in a huddle and doing things like that. So a lot of it is you got to learn how to break down these lengthy calls. Like 'OK, what matters to me and what doesn't?' I think those guys have been great.\"&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Blue is the more likely of the two to factor into the Cowboys' plans in 2025 despite his stature and the aforementioned adjustment to an NFL playbook. He's 5-foot-9 and weighs 196 pounds at the NFL Scouting Combine, slightly undersized for an NFL running back, but his speed is undeniable.&nbsp;</p><p>Blue's 4.38-second 40-yard dash ranked as the second-fastest among running backs at the combine -- speed that helped him co-lead collegiate running backs with six receiving touchdowns in 2024.

I know Coach Schottenheimer has got some tricks up his sleeves to use the skillset that he has in the other guys, but [Blue is] an explosive player that can flip the field for you and can also win you some matchups in man-to-man coverage versus linebackers. ...

Palmer took over the No 10 shirt for Chelsea this season and it seems the pressure that number tends to bestow upon its wearer has been a benefit to him, rather than a hindrance. His performance in the final followed solid showings in the group stage and knockouts, in which he played a variety of roles behind the striker. Chelsea will hope that he will carry over his great form stateside into the next Premier League season, rather than reproduce the pedestrian showings that marked much of last season.</p><p><strong>Roofs, domes and the Pacific </strong><strong>north-west: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/25/club-world-cup-heat\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Heat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/29/its-not-football-maresca-furious-after-chelseas-two-hour-weather-delay\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">weather delays</a> were among a few hiccups that disrupted portions of this tournament, except in locations where they were rendered irrelevant. Domed venues, such as Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, were cool and comfortable even amid a mid-tournament heatwave. Seattle’s Lumen Field, which hosted six games, was naturally comfortable thanks to its location and the climate in that part of the country.

Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, admitted to reporters in the lead-up to the final that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/world-cup-will-use-more-indoor-venues-for-day-time-kick-offs-to-combat-heat\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">heat was an issue</a> at this tournament, and that it would address it by playing games under roofed stadiums at next year’s World Cup.

Given the ever-increasing number of games in a grueling club season, the tournament always had the potential for unnecessary injuries – never more true than in the case of Bayern’s Jamal Musiala, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/06/jamal-musiala-injury-long-period-out-fibula-fracture-ankle-dislocation-bayern-munich-club-world-cup\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">sustained a broken and dislocated ankle</a> in a collision with PSG’s goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma that will keep him out for most of the next year. The temperatures were hot, the games intense and the players involved<strong>, </strong>other than those who came to the tournament mid-season, will have weeks fewer than usual for rest and recovery before heading back into pre-season training. The long-term effects of the Club World Cup might not be fully known until well into the upcoming season, but they’re unlikely to be good.</p><p><strong>PSG:</strong> Luis Enrique’s side stormed through the tournament, looking every bit the team that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/31/psg-win-champions-league-for-first-time-with-record-5-0-final-hammering-of-inter\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">demolished Inter 5-0</a> in the Champions League final. They were the odds-on favorites to win in the final after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/09/paris-saint-germain-real-madrid-club-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">rolling through Real Madrid</a>, which would have left no doubt about who the best team in the world are (however much of that there was to begin with). Instead, PSG are left to deal with arguably the worst possible outcome: the maximum amount of time spent extending the season, the least amount of rest before the next season, and a measly $88m or so (at minimum) for their trouble. Those winnings are nothing to sneeze at in a vacuum, and could be a help for financial fair play regulations, but the figure also does not represent a significant addition to the coffers of the owner QSI, which has a net worth in the hundreds of billions.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-10\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p><strong>Any confederation other than Uefa and Conmebol:</strong> If you were a team hailing from anywhere in the world outside the two power centers of club football, chances are you had a bad time at the Club World Cup. The Asian, African, Oceanian and North and Central American teams in the tournament combined to win 12% of their games on average, with only three of them making the knockout round. Make no mistake, there were fantastic moments such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/01/manchester-city-al-hilal-club-world-cup-last-16-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Al-Hilal’s big win over Manchester City</a> in the last 16. But on the whole, the other confederations will hope the next four years bring about some drastic rebalancing of the club game.</p><p><strong>The turf: </strong>In several venues, including MetLife Stadium where the final was hosted, artificial turf was overlaid by sod for the Club World Cup. The resulting surface was most certainly better than artificial turf, but it still drew complaints from players and coaches alike. (Said Chelsea’s Reece James of MetLife: “The venue is top. The pitches are not so good. Hopefully there’s some changes for the World Cup next year.”) In the final, Fifa extended cooling breaks to five minutes and brought out sprinklers to water the grass in that time, which a spokesperson said was in response to complaints about the surface becoming too dry in the sun. Next year, the turf at each venue will have a full seven weeks to bed in before it gets used in the tournament. Plenty of interested parties will hope that the extra time makes a difference.</p></div></div>"

That's exactly what he did, and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/tennis/news/jannik-sinner-takes-wimbledon-the-winning-formula-to-oust-carlos-alcaraz-after-french-open-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\">he found the winning formula against Alcaraz</a></span>. </p><p>\"End of the day, it doesn't really matter if I won or lost [in Paris], it was just as important [after the] tournament to understand what you did wrong,\" Sinner said. \"That's exactly what we did. We tried to accept the loss and just keep working. I'm so grateful that I'm healthy and I have great people around me.\" </p><p>Not only was this Sinner's first Wimbledon win, but he also made some history as the first Italian man to win the tournament. On top of that, Sinner snapped Alcaraz's 20-match winning streak as the Spaniard was going for his third straight title. </p><p>This match was <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/tennis/news/jannik-sinner-takes-wimbledon-the-winning-formula-to-oust-carlos-alcaraz-after-french-open-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\">just another chapter in a budding rivalry</a></span> between two of the best young players in the world, writes Brad Crawford. </p><ul><li><strong>Crawford:</strong> <em>\"It's hard to imagine any player on tour consistently beating these two when they're at their best. Sinner has reached four consecutive majors finals with two wins, while Alcaraz just saw a lengthy grass-court winning streak end coming off his fifth career Grand Slam.\"</em></li></ul><p>In addition to the pride of winning at Wimbledon, this title also netted Sinner a cool $4.1 million.

may want to forget everything that happened after getting there. </p><p>The Parisians <a

to Chelsea</a> at MetLife Stadium, and the match was never really close. Chelsea's <strong>Cole Palmer</strong> scored goals in the 27th and 30th minutes, and <strong>Joao Pedro</strong> sent his team into halftime with a 3-0 lead. PSG never mounted any resistance, and Chelsea cruised to a win, as Charles Booth writes. </p><ul><li><strong>Booth:</strong> <em>\"It felt like the Parisians ran out of steam in the match, and their press wasn't there as Chelsea created chance after chance with runs down the flanks. Malo Gusto ran through the PSG defense for Chelsea's opener, and from there, it seemed like only one team was playing in the match.\"</em></li></ul><p>To make matters worse for PSG, manager <strong>Luis Enrique</strong> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/psg-manager-luis-enrique-involved-in-altercation-with-chelseas-joao-pedro-after-club-world-cup-final/\" target=\"_blank\">thrust himself into the midst of controversy</a></span> after the match.

That's what happened for <strong>Eli Willits</strong> when the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/eli-willits-selected-no-1-in-2025-mlb-draft-why-nationals-went-with-high-school-shortstop-with-first-pick/\" target=\"_blank\">Nationals called his name with the top pick</a></span> on Sunday night. </p><p>At 17 years and 216 days, Willits became the youngest No. 1 pick in MLB history. A switch-hitting shortstop, Willits joins <strong>Stephen Strasburg</strong> and <strong>Bryce Harper</strong> as the only first overall picks in Nationals history. That's not bad company, and Washington will be very pleased if Willits achieves those same heights. </p><p>Outside of the Nationals and Willits, there were some other big winners from the first night of the draft. <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/2025-mlb-draft-winners-and-losers-eli-willits-surprise-angels-pick-rockies-social-media-and-more-from-day-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Perhaps the biggest winners</a></span>, per Mike Axisa, were the Mariners. Seattle jumped up 14 spots to No. 3 overall in the draft lottery, and the top pitching prospect fell right into the team's lap. </p><ul><li><strong>Axisa:</strong>&nbsp;\"<em>Seattle would have had no chance to draft Anderson -- none, zero -- had they remained at No. 17. Anderson was the top pitching prospect in the draft class and a strong candidate to go No. 1 overall.

She was 4 of 12 from the field and 2 of 7 from deep.

Moving the ball well, getting to the next action, playing out of pick-and-roll well.\" </p><p>Sunday's game was also a marquee matchup between two of the league's best young players as Clark and <strong>Paige Bueckers</strong> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/fevers-caitlin-clark-wings-paige-bueckers-reflect-on-first-wnba-matchup-share-admiration-for-one-another/\" target=\"_blank\">went head-to-head for the first time</a></span> at the WNBA level. Bueckers said it was just fun to battle against Clark at the highest level. </p><p>\"It's fun any time we can compete against each other,\" Bueckers said. \"We're two competitors who just want to win and have grown up playing against each other, playing with each other, so it's great. And the environment's great here. I feel like every game is a sell-out so they have a great homecourt advantage.\" </p><h2> 🔥 SEC burning questions </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"untitled-design-2025-07-13t233451-048.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/14/54c8bb70-348c-4f06-a090-d8d644c3c014/resize/670x377/1c1d61c752e6cb9dccbf4ef5bfbd9d1f/untitled-design-2025-07-13t233451-048.png\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"377\" width=\"670\"></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>Talking Season is officially upon us in the SEC.

That said, those answers probably won't come until the games are played. </p><p>For instance, Kalen DeBoer led Alabama to a 9-4 record last year. At most places, that's worthy of a celebration, but not in Tuscaloosa.

We even <a href=\"https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections\">recommend it</a>!

Hey, things can still work out -- I quite enjoy picking last in Round 1, thus consecutively and first in Round 2 -- but the point is, nobody has much control in a draft.</p><p>As Mick Jagger has been telling us for more than 50 years, you can't always get what you want. He probably wasn't talking about standard fantasy football drafts, but let's pretend, for our purposes.</p><p>In a salary cap draft, however, you can always get what you want.</p><p>Don't be intimidated, folks. Perhaps you've always been a standard drafter and that is all you aspire to, but you should give the salary cap drafts a try. They're fun, far more intriguing and captivating, and there's nothing standard about them. Here you don't just make a pick and wait impatiently for the next one, watching players you desire join other teams. There's a whole lot more strategy involved in a salary cap draft and, to reiterate, if you really want Chase or Robinson or Barkley, you can get them. In fact, it is a legitimate strategy to try to get all three of them!</p><p>Let's start with the basics.</p><h3>A salary cap draft is not really a draft</h3><p>It is a very different, cool way to fill a fantasy football roster. Each team has a set spending budget of allotted funds to spend, typically a default $200. (Not real money, of course.) Managers nominate players in a pre-set order, whether they want the player or not (occasionally to induce others to spend money), then everyone bids on players until each individual process concludes with the player going to the highest bidder and everyone fills their roster. This is a timed process, moving along at a swift pace. It's a fun adventure, different every time.</p><h3>There are myriad ways to fill a roster, and managers should strategize for multiple scenarios</h3><p>Chase, Robinson and Barkley are superstar players, thus they cost a lot. Other managers will want them, too. Figure out what you are willing to spend for individuals, perhaps even for set positions. A stars-and-scrubs strategy works for some, and it comes recommended for newbies. Others covet more balance, attracting players that would typically go after the first few rounds of a draft, but more of them. Be open to possibility as the bidding process develops.</p><h3>Patience is key when warranted, and managers should be willing to zig when others zag</h3><p>Perhaps you enter the proceedings set on <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"38248455-3da4-84e4-8090-98b5cc38ffdc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens</a> QB <a data-player-guid=\"7d76fbb1-1c5e-d9f4-954f-cad43f720ae2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson</a> and have scripted a plan to afford the last season's top scorer along with a strong set of running backs and wide receivers. Then a Ravens fan keeps outbidding you for Jackson, forcing you to alter your plan. Be willing to alter the plan. You may find that securing a lesser -- but still productive -- quarterback permits more financial flexibility at other positions.</p><h3>Track your money spent and avoid extremes</h3><p>In other words, try to avoid being the manager who aggressively spends nearly all their money in the first 30 minutes, but also don't be the one who conservatively retains most of their money. It is not a good feeling having money to spend and realizing there isn't enough talent left to create a formidable roster. See how others are bidding. Some players will be overpriced based on consensus. Others will be bargains. It is OK to spend freely on occasion and wait for values as well.</p><h3>Utilize a tiered approach to evaluate supply versus demand</h3><p>While ESPN provides tiered rankings (coming soon) and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/FFCheatSheetCent25-44507555/2025-fantasy-football-rankings-cheat-sheet-depth-charts-ppr\">cheat sheets with salary cap values</a>, everyone should produce their own based on their own strategy. Use our rankings/tiers as a reasonable base. These are your teams, after all! Bidding wars escalate quickly, so having a separate print out to gauge availability helps. Cross out names as you go along. If three running backs from a tier of four are off the board, perhaps you spend a bit extra for that last option. If it is a seven-player tier, perhaps not. Regardless, know what is left to bid on for later, and aim for a balance across the key positions.</p><h3>Manage the back of the roster properly</h3><p>Remember, the process of initially filling the rosters is hardly the end of the game. Managers are restricted by max bids, and they can bid on players if they have enough funds to fill all roster spots. As with drafts, there will be in-season movement based on injuries, performance, bye weeks, etc., so you don't need to leave the salary cap draft with a backup quarterback or a fill-in running back for Week 10. Also as with drafts, when team defenses and kickers (should) go at the very end, spend as little money as possible to fill these spots.</p><h3>We're talking about practice</h3><p>Trying out something new means there's a learning curve, so if you're looking forward to your first competitive salary cap draft, don't go in cold and hope to pick it up on the fly.  Our <a href=\"https://fantasy.espn.com/football/mockdraftlobby\">Mock Draft Lobby</a> offers salary cap mocks that will let you get the hang of where everything is and how it work, get a feel for the clock and try your hand at bidding on the players before you have to do it for real.</p><p>And with that, you should be good to go! And to complete Mick's thought, remember that while you may not always get what you want, if you bid just right, you might find you get what you need.</p>\n</div></div>"

The current CBA runs through the end of the 2025-26 season, with the new one carrying through the end of the 2029-30 season.</p><p>While the continuation of labor peace is the most important development for a league that has endured multiple work stoppages this millennium, there are a number of wrinkles that are noteworthy to fans.</p><p>ESPN reporters Ryan S. Clark, Kristen Shilton and Greg Wyshynski break it all down for you here:</p><p><strong>Draft recap: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/45598333/2025-nhl-draft-pick-tracker-analysis-32-teams-7-rounds-scouting-notes\">All 224 picks</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/45606178/nhl-draft-2025-grades-best-players-top-prospects-picks-value\">Grades for all 32 teams</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://https//www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/45605326/nhl-draft-2025-winners-losers-best-teams-top-players-moments\">Winners and losers</a></strong></p><p><img height=\"6px\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>When does this new CBA take effect?</h2><p>The new NHL CBA is set to begin on Sept. 16, 2026 and runs through Sept. 15, 2030. Including the coming season, that gives the NHL five years of labor peace, and would make the fastest both sides have reached an extension in Gary Bettman's tenure as NHL commissioner.</p><p>It's also the first major negotiation for NHLPA head Marty Walsh, who stepped into the executive director role in 2023 -- <em>Shilton</em></p><h2>What are the big differences in the new CBA compared to the current one?</h2><p>There are a few major headlines from the new CBA.</p><p>First are the schedule changes: the league will move to an 84-game regular season, with a shortened preseason (a maximum of four games), so each team is still able to play every opponent while divisional rivals have four games against one another every other season.</p><p>There will also be alterations to contract lengths, going to a maximum seven-year deal instead of the current eight-year mark; right now, a player can re-sign for eight years with his own team or seven with another in free agency, while the new CBA stipulates it'll be seven or six years, respectively.</p><p>Deferred salaries will also be on the way out. And there will be a new position established for a team's full-time emergency backup goaltender -- or EBUG -- where that player can practice and travel with the team.</p><p>The CBA also contains updated language on long-term injured reserve and how it can be used, particularly when it comes to adding players from LTIR to the roster for the postseason -- <em>Shilton</em></p><h2>What's the motivation for an 84-game season?</h2><p>The new CBA expands the regular season to 84 games and reduces the exhibition season to four games per team. Players with 100 games played in their NHL careers can play in a maximum of two exhibition games. Players who competed in at least 50 games in the previous season will have a maximum of 13 days of training camp.</p><p>The NHL had an 84-game season from 1992 to 1994, when the league and NHLPA agreed to add two neutral-site games to every team's schedule. But since 1995-96, every full NHL regular season has been 82 games.</p><p>For at least the past four years, the league has had internal discussions about adding two games to the schedule while decreasing the preseason. The current CBA restricted teams from playing more than 82 games, so expansion of the regular season required collective bargaining.</p><p>There was a functional motivation behind the increase in games: Currently, each team plays either three or four games against divisional opponents, for a total of 26 games; they play three games against non-divisional teams within their own conference, for a total of 24 games; and they play two games, home and away, against opponents from the other conference for a total of 32 games. Adding two games would allow teams to even out their divisional schedule, while swapping in two regular-season games -- with regular-season crowd sizes and prices -- for two exhibition games.</p><p>The reduction of the preseason would also give the NHL the chance to start the regular season earlier, perhaps in the last week of September. Obviously, given the grind of the current regular season and the playoffs, there's concern about wear and tear on the players with two additional games. But the reduction of training camp and the exhibition season was appealing to players, and they signed off on the 84-game season in the new CBA. -- <em>Wyshynski</em></p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45623366\" data-cerebro-id=\"68632b912c1a6662c312a313\" data-title=\"Why Mitch Marner is a great fit for Vegas\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0630%2Fdm_250630_NHL_Analysis_Marner_talk%2Fdm_250630_NHL_Analysis_Marner_talk.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0630%2Fdm_250630_NHL_Analysis_Marner_talk%2Fdm_250630_NHL_Analysis_Marner_talk.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0630%2Fdm_250630_NHL_Analysis_Marner_talk%2Fdm_250630_NHL_Analysis_Marner_talk.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45623366\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:49</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Why Mitch Marner is a great fit for Vegas</p><p>Greg Wyshynski reports on Mitch Marner getting traded from the Maple Leafs to the Golden Knights.</p></div></div><h2>How do the new long-term injured reserve rules work?</h2><p>The practice of teams using long-term injured reserve (LTIR) to create late-season salary cap space -- only to have the injured player return for the first game of the playoffs after sitting out game No. 82 of the regular season -- tracks back to 2015.

He said that the NHL made closing that loophole \"a priority for them\" in labor talks.</p><p>Under the new CBA, the total salary and bonuses for \"a player or players\" that have replaced a player on LTIR may not exceed the amount of total salary and bonuses of the player they are replacing. For example: In 2024, the Golden Knights put winger Stone and his $9.5 million salary on LTIR, given that he was out because of a lacerated spleen.

Teams can exceed these \"average amounts,\" but the injured player would be ineligible to return that season or in the postseason.</p><p>But the NHL and NHLPA doubled-down on discouraging teams from abusing LTIR to go over the salary cap in the Stanley Cup playoffs by establishing \"playoff cap counting\" for the first time. -- <em>Wyshynski</em></p><h2>What is 'playoff cap counting' and how will it affect the postseason?</h2><p>In 2021, the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b7b7b58e-e579-b39d-fb2d-70213dd93502\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/car/carolina-hurricanes\">Carolina Hurricanes</a> lost to Tampa Bay in the Eastern Conference playoffs.

The IIHF did the same for international tournaments, while USA Hockey required all players under the age of 18 to wear them.</p><p>Now, the NHL and NHLPA have adjusted their standards for neck protection in the new CBA.</p><p>Beginning with the 2026-27 season, players who have zero games of NHL experience will be required to wear \"cut-resistant protection on the neck area with a minimum cut level protection score of A5.\" The ANSI/ISEA 105-2016 Standard rates neck guards on a scale from A1 to A9, and players are encouraged to seek out neck protection that's better than the minimal requirement.</p><p>Players with NHL experience prior to the 2026-27 season will not be required to wear neck protection. -- <em>Wyshynski</em></p><h2>What's the new player dress code?</h2><p>The NHL and NHLPA agreed that teams will no longer be permitted \"to propose any rules concerning player dress code.\"</p><p>Under the previous CBA, the NHL was the only North American major men's pro sports league with a dress code specified through collective bargaining. Exhibit 14, Rule 5 read: \"Players are required to wear jackets, ties and dress pants to all Club games and while traveling to and from such games unless otherwise specified by the Head Coach or General Manager.\"</p><p>That rule was deleted in the new CBA.</p><p>The only requirement now for players is that they \"dress in a manner that is consistent with contemporary fashion norms.\"</p><p>Sorry, boys: No toga parties on game days. -- <em>Wyshynski</em></p><h2>Does the new CBA cover the Olympics beyond 2026?</h2><p>Yes. The NHL and NHLPA have committed to participate in the 2030 Winter Olympics, scheduled to be held in the French Alps. As usual, the commitment is \" subject to negotiation of terms acceptable to each of the NHL, NHLPA, IIHF and/or IOC.\"</p><p>And as we saw with the 2022 Beijing Games, having a commitment in the CBA doesn't guarantee NHL players on Olympic ice. -- <em>Wyshynski</em></p><h2>Did the NHL end three-team salary retention trades?</h2><p>It has become an NHL trade deadline tradition. One team retains salary on a player so he can fit under another team's salary cap. But to make the trade happen, those teams invite a third team to the table to retain even more of that salary to make it work.</p><p>Like when the Lightning acquired old friend <a data-player-guid=\"24c4a74c-86bd-68ce-686c-83193e41ce8f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3094261/yanni-gourde\">Yanni Gourde</a> from the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ca912ee8-d2a3-3e84-831e-1a0ca38e7c3f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-kraken\">Seattle Kraken</a> last season. Gourde made $5,166,667 against the cap. Seattle traded him to Detroit for defenseman Kyle Aucoin, and the Kraken retained $2,583,334 in salary. The Red Wings then retained $1,291,667 of Gourde's salary in sending him to Tampa Bay for a fourth-round pick, allowing the Lightning to fit him under their cap.</p><p>Though the NHL will still allow retained salary transactions, there's now a mandatory waiting period until that player's salary can be retained in a second transaction. A second retained salary transaction may not occur within 75 regular-season days of the first retained salary transaction.</p><p>Days outside of the regular-season schedule do not count toward the required 75 regular-season days, and therefore the restriction might span multiple seasons, according to the CBA. -- <em>Wyshynski</em></p><h2>Can players now endorse alcoholic beverages?</h2><p>Yes. The previous CBA banned players from any endorsement or sponsorship of alcoholic beverages. That has been taken out of the new CBA. If only <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/4547/bob-beers\">Bob Beers</a> were still playing ...</p><p>While players remain prohibited from any endorsement or sponsorship of tobacco products, a carryover from the previous CBA, they're also banned from endorsement or sponsorship of \"cannabis (including CBD) products.\" -- <em>Wyshynski</em></p><h2>What are the new parameters for Emergency Goaltender Replacement?</h2><p>The NHL is making things official with the emergency backup goaltender (EBUG) position.</p><p>In the past, that third goalie spot went to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/28797288/no-nhl-does-not-ebug-problem\">someone hanging out in the arena</a> during a game, ready to jump in for either team if both of their own goaltenders were injured or fell ill during the course of play. Basically, it was a guy in street clothes holding onto the dream of holding down an NHL crease.</p><p>Now, the league has given permanent status to the EBUG role. That player will travel with and practice for only one club. But there are rules involved in their employment.</p><p>This CBA designates that to serve as a team's emergency goaltender replacement, the individual cannot have played an NHL game under an NHL contract, appeared in more than 80 professional hockey games, have been in professional hockey within the previous three seasons, have a contractual obligation that would prevent them from fulfilling their role as the EBUG or be on the reserve or restricted free agent list of an NHL club.</p><p>Teams must submit one designated EBUG 48 hours before the NHL regular season starts. During the season, teams can declare that player 24 hours before a game. -- <em>Shilton</em></p><h2>What's the deal with eliminating deferred salaries?</h2><p>The new CBA will prohibit teams from brokering deferred salary arrangements, meaning players will be paid in full during the contract term lengths. This is meant to save players from financial uncertainty and makes for simplified contract structures with the club.</p><p>There are examples of players who had enormous signing bonuses paid up front or had structured their deals to include significant payouts when they ended. Both tactics could serve to lower an individual's cap hit over the life of a deal. Now that won't be an option for teams or players to use in negotiations. -- <em>Shilton</em></p><h2>What's different about contract lengths?</h2><p>Starting under the new CBA, the maximum length of a player contract will go from eight years to seven years if he's re-signing with the same club, and down to just six years (from the current seven) if he signs with a new team.</p><p>So, for example, a player coming off his three-year, entry-level contract could re-sign only with that same team for up to seven years, and he'll become an unrestricted free agent sooner than the current agreement would allow.</p><p>This could benefit teams that have signed players to long-term contracts that didn't age well (for whatever reason) as they won't be tied as long to that decision. And for players, it can help preserve some of their prime years if they want to move on following a potential 10 (rather than 11) maximum seasons with one club. -- <em>Shilton</em></p><h2>What does the new league minimum salary look like? How does it compare to the other men's professional leagues?</h2><p>Under the new CBA, the minimum salary for an NHL player will rise from $775,000 to $1 million by the end of the four-year agreement. Although gradual, it is a significant rise for a league in which the salary cap presents more challenges compared to its counterparts.</p><p>For example, the NHL will see its salary cap rise to $95.5 million in 2025-26, compared to that of the NFL in which Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34096853/highest-paid-nfl-players-tracking-most-money-guaranteed-per-year-every-position\">highest three-year average is $61.6 million</a>.</p><p>So how does the new NHL minimum salary upon the CBA's completion compare to its counterparts in the Big 4?</p><p>The NBA league minimum for the 2025-26 season is $1.4 million for a rookie, while players with more than 10 years can earn beyond $3.997 million in a league that has a maximum of 15 roster spots</p><p>The NFL, which has a 53-player roster, has a league minimum of $840,000 for rookies in 2025, while a veteran with more than seven years will earn $1.255 million.</p><p>MLB's CBA, which expires after the 2026 season, has the minimum salary for the 2025 season set at $760,000, and that figure increases to $780,000 next season. -- <em>Clark</em></p><h2>Is this Gary Bettman's final CBA as commissioner?</h2><p>Possibly. The Athletic reported in January that the board of governors had begun planning for Bettman's eventual retirement \"in a couple of years,\" while starting the process to find his successor.</p><p>Bettman became the NHL's first commissioner in 1993, and has the distinction of being the longest-serving commissioner among the four major men's professional leagues in North America. He is also the oldest. Bettman turned 73 in June, while contemporaries Roger Goodell, Rob Manfred and Adam Silver are all in their early- to mid-60s.</p><p>That's not to suggest he couldn't remain in place. There is a precedent of commissioners across those leagues who remained in those respective roles into their 70s. Ford Frick, who served as the third commissioner of MLB, was 71 when he stepped down in 1965. There are more recent examples than Frick, as former NBA commissioner David Stern stepping down in 2014 when he was 71, and former MLB commissioner Bud Selig stepped down in 2015 at age 80. -- <em>Clark</em></p>\n</div></div>"

It feels like a shortcut. A nod to nostalgia rather than merit, and that's unfair to fighters who are working their way up properly.</b></p><p>I realise that might sound harsh given he is one of the sport's all-time greats, an eight-division world champion. I have immense respect for what he achieved in his prime. He's a global icon, a true legend.</p><p>But he is 46. It has been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/49061554\">six years since his previous pro win</a> and the last time we saw him in a ring was in an uninspiring exhibition, which showed just how much his skills have faded.</p><p>So with all that in mind, I just cannot understand how he can jump into a sanctioned WBC world-title fight against Mario Barrios.</p><p>That's the part that really shocked me when I heard of Pacquiao's return. Usually, a fighter coming back from retirement eases into the sport with tune-up fights. </p><p>Not Pacquiao. He's skipping all that and going right to the front of the queue.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>I had a brief exchange with Mauricio Sulaiman, the WBC president, on social media about this. He wasn't pleased with my doubt but, in my view, it sets a strange precedent and undermines the fighters who have been grinding their way up the ranks, paying their dues with tough fights.</p><p>We've seen comebacks before. We saw one with George Foreman, who fought his way back, winning tough fights en route to regaining the heavyweight title at the age of 45.</p><p>Pacquiao, however, hasn't fought a competitive bout in years. In the exhibition against Japanese fighter Rukiya Anpo last year, his movement was slow and his timing was completely off.</p><p>That's why it doesn't sit right with me. You can't just waltz back in, skipping the comeback phase, and jump straight into a world title fight because of your legendary status.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"Can-Pacquiao-beat-Barrios\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">Can Pacquiao beat Barrios?</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>From a trainer's point of view, it's incredibly difficult to coach someone who is so far beyond their peak.</p><p>Pacquiao's style was very high energy - bouncing around, moving off angles and using his sharp reflexes. That's brilliant when you're young and fresh.</p><p>But when you're 46, you simply can't keep that up for 12 rounds. Your legs get tired. Your reflexes slow down. And when you get hit in the body, it slows you even more. Barrios will certainly try to work the body to slow Pacquiao down.</p><p>Opponents will study his movement and timing in the gym and build a strategy to exploit any weaknesses.</p><p>Perhaps Team Pacquiao think they can get the win because Barrios isn't the strongest champion in the division and is a beatable boxer.

However, the 2025 Open Championship field is loaded with golfers from the United Kingdom who could end this drought. From a Scot like Robert MacIntyre to Englishmen such as Matt Fitzpatrick and Justin Rose to an Irishman like McIlroy, Brits have a good chance to win this major for the 67th time in history. Meanwhile, Americans are seeking their 48th Open Championship victory and third in a row, as Scottie Scheffler is the +450 favorite, per the 2025 Open Championship odds, to make it a three-peat for the United States.</p><p> McIlroy has the best Open Championship odds amongst U.K. golfers at +700, with Englishman Tommy Fleetwood at +2800 and MacIntyre at +3500. Other heavy favorites to utilize in 2025 British Open bets include Jon Rahm (+1200), Bryson DeChambeau (+2000) and the defending champion in Xander Schauffele (+2500).

It was back in June when he finished seventh at the Memorial, which was his third top-10 of the season. He had three consecutive top-20 finishes between the Valero Texas Open, The Masters, and the RBC Heritage. Finally, he was impressive in finishing 23rd last month at Oakmont.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Spieth, the 2017 British Open champion, has had as much success at this major than any other. It's the only in which he's never missed a cut, going a perfect 11 for 11, and he has eight top 25s over his last nine Open Championship starts. That includes five top 10s over the last decade, and he held his own at the 2019 Open at Royal Portrush, sitting in eighth place entering the final round before heavy rainfall on Sunday had him finishing 20th. This year on tour, just 13 players have a better scoring average (adjusted) than Spieth's 70.179, so he's performing much better than his long Open Championship odds indicate.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-predictions-top-picks-props-longshots-and-pga-golfers-to-fade-this-week/#ttag=07092025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_Kannon_OpenChampionship\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to back here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship picks </h2><p>Kannon has locked in his best bets for the 2025 Open Championship and has also selected two epic longshots who are priced over 75-1.

Clearly, the Vikings head coach has the ability to maximize his offense and get the most out of his quarterbacks provided they have some level of base talent, and Darnold earning MVP votes after being a top-of-the-draft bust and journeyman quarterback is one of the best QB coaching success stories in recent memory. If the talent is there with McCarthy and the former Michigan quarterback can stay healthy behind an upgraded offensive line, O'Connell has a great chance at leading his team back to the playoffs.</p><p>A defense that took a major leap in Brian Flores' first season in 2023 went from 13th to fifth in scoring last year but stayed 16th in yardage for the second straight year. Rather than rest on their laurels, the Vikings went out and made several changes to the unit. Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave are coming off down years but both have a history of quality play on the defensive front. Isaiah Rodgers was a smart value pickup as his performance in limited snaps with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> since being drafted in 2020 has earned him a more prominent role.</p><h2>Reasons to fade the Vikings</h2><p>There is the possibility that McCarthy is closer in talent to the Nick Mullens tier of QB that struggled under O'Connell. His NFL comparisons were all over the map during 2024 but did include players like Daniel Jones, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964377/will-levis/\">Will Levis</a> and even one of the backup QBs that was part of that 2023 Vikings season, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2975722/jaren-hall/\">Jaren Hall</a>. McCarthy lost a key year of development due to the injury, and he's walking into one of the toughest schedules and divisions in the league.</p><p>Speaking of that schedule, McCarthy will have to be on point right out of the gate to pick up wins against potentially the easiest part of Minnesota's schedule. The Vikings start by facing an improved <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a> team on the road before hosting the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a>, then have to manage a two-week trip to England to face the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a>. Following a Week 6 bye, the Vikings have six games against playoff teams in eight weeks as well as matchups with the Bears and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a>. If McCarthy is good and the defense doesn't regress, the Vikings could win around half of their games against playoff opponents, excel in their other matchups and get to 10 or 11 wins. But if things start to go south, the schedule is such that Minnesota's only \"easy\" matchups will be on the road against the Browns and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a>.</p><h2>How to bet the Vikings in 2025</h2><ul><li><strong>Under 9.5 wins -125 (DraftKings)</strong></li><li><strong>Miss playoffs -105 (BetMGM)</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871343/justin-jefferson/\">Justin Jefferson</a> Over 1200.5 receiving yards -115 (Caesars)</strong></li></ul><p>The make/miss playoffs market is a great way to take a position on Minnesota if you have a strong feeling on what the Vikings will get out of McCarthy in 2025, as most markets make it around a coin flip. Last year, the Vikings' win total was 6.5 with McCarthy as the projected starter, and I don't think Darnold's career season should move their win total up by three heading into this year. The reworked offensive line will take a little time to come together, and by the time they do, the Vikings will be in the brutal part of their schedule. I'm also not counting on another top-10 scoring season from the Vikings, and when you pair that with what could be an average offense, this doesn't feel like a playoff team to me.</p><p>One player I'm not concerned about regardless of McCarthy's performance is Justin Jefferson, who has averaged more receiving yards per game than anyone in NFL history despite the Vikings' quarterback situation over the last few years. Jefferson's 1,533 yards last year saw his average yards per game actually drop more than 15 yards from each of the previous two seasons, and he may only need to play 12 games to top 1,200 yards. As long as he doesn't miss more than three games this season, he should get Over his total.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Considered a sleeper <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> team by many heading into the year, the Packers went 1-5 against NFC North teams to finish third in the division and then bowed out unceremoniously in the Wild Card Round by losing to the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> for a second time that season.</p><p>The good news? The Packers won every other game on their schedule to finish 11-6 while posting the fifth-best offense in yards gained and the fifth-best defense in yards allowed in the league. The latter performance is key after the defense failed to live up to its talent level regularly under the former defensive coordinator, and though the playoff loss to the Eagles stings, the Packers did as good a job as anyone of limiting Philadelphia's scoring during their title run.</p><p>In order to take the next step, Love will have to play more like the quarterback he was during the second half of 2023 than he did last season, when he averaged 225.9 yards per game and completed 63.1% of his pass attempts while throwing 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Over the last eight games the previous year, Love averaged 268.8 yards per game while completing 70.3% of his pass attempts and pacing to a 38-touchdown, two-interception season. In order to put him in the best position to succeed, the Packers did something they rarely ever do: draft a receiver in the first round in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28874927/matthew-golden/\">Matthew Golden</a>.

The team suffered almost no notable losses on either side of the ball aside from parting ways with cornerback Jaire Alexander, and the Packers teams that made the playoffs the last two years were the two youngest playoff rosters of the last 45 years. A young roster has the potential to keep improving, and the continuity of the staff and personnel, only helps matters.</p><p>The one place the Packers have been lacking in recent years is having a difference-maker at receiver rather than a bunch of good complementary pieces, so it was encouraging to see them buck trends and draft one in the first round, then take another two rounds later. Both Matthew Golden and Savion Williams have the chance to emerge as key pieces as rookies, and once <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2869806/christian-watson/\">Christian Watson</a> returns late in the year after tearing his ACL in the regular-season finale, the group of pass-catchers at Love's disposal should be deep.</p><h2>Reasons to fade the Packers</h2><p>The schedule may not be as hard as it is for some in the division, but it's no cakewalk, with trips to Arizona and Denver among the team's non-common opponents. That schedule gets brutal down the stretch, with five of the team's divisional games from Week 12 on along with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> trip and a home game against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a>. The Packers will have to start strong, and a home matchup against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a> in Week 1 could determine whether this team is ready to elevate itself to Super Bowl contender.</p><p>Another key element that may hold the Packers back in a tough division is Love, who has bounced between looking like an MVP contender to average play in his two seasons as starter, and while the former has been more focused on the second half of the year when you want your quarterback peaking, the playoff loss to the Eagles was particularly troubling with Love throwing three interceptions following seven straight games with no picks. A dud like that could haunt a young quarterback heading into the following season.</p><h2>How to bet the Packers in 2025</h2><ul><li><strong>Over 9.5 wins +105 (FanDuel)</strong></li><li><strong>Make playoffs -112 (FanDuel)</strong></li><li><strong>Win NFC North +275 (BetMGM)</strong></li><li><strong>Jordan Love Over 3550.5 passing yards -115 (Caesars)</strong></li></ul><p>I was high on the Packers heading into last season and feel like their success is being somewhat looked over thanks to the Lions and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a> running hot. While the Packers lost five of their six divisional games, only one was by more than three points, and that game involved Love throwing a pick-six near the end of the first half in an eventual 10-point loss to the best team in the NFC. The baseline level of play of this team is high, and I see them as much closer to the Lions than the market is valuing. I also think it's worth a small play backing them to win the Super Bowl, with +2200 the best number at BetMGM and FanDuel, as their ceiling is as high as anyone's in the NFC.</p><p>The yardage total on Love seems low to me considering he had 4,159 passing yards in his first season as starter and paced to 3,841 passing yards last year while missing two games. With a good offensive line protecting him, I'd expect Love to have as good a chance as most to play all 17 games, especially as a tough division will likely preclude the Packers from resting players in Week 18. Even if he does miss two games, he could get over this total if he's closer to his pace from 2023 than last year.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

England responded by saying they are always under pressure so this is nothing new.

But it might not have been in their best interests.</p><p>It was not a pretty evening for <em>Les Blues </em>as Netherlands looked dangerous in the first half, but three goals in six minutes after the break turned things around as Netherlands chased the three-goal win they needed to sneak through to the knockouts.</p><p>If France take a look at the bracket now, though, finishing top might not offer them their best chance of a place in the final. They're now drawn into arguably the tougher side of the knockouts, facing eight-time winners Germany in the quarterfinals, with a semifinal against either hosts Switzerland or world champions Spain to contend with after that ... yikes. -- <em>Emily Keogh</em></p><h3>Wales fans enjoying the spotlight</h3><p>Wales' hopes of progression to the knockout stages had already been dashed by successive defeats to Netherlands and France, but that didn't stop their army of passionate fans from enjoying the build-up to the clash with England in St. Gallen.</p><p>Fans of both teams gathered outside St. Gallen Cathedral in the build-up to kickoff. And, while the England fans launched into a lively chorus of \"Football's Coming Home\", supporters of Rhian Wilkinson's side responded with good-natured taunts of \"You're Going Home.\" -- <em>Beth Lindop</em></p><p>The Wales fans have been a key part of this competition's tapestry. They've travelled in their thousands to watch their team play in their first major tournament, and wherever they've gone, they've brought plenty of passion and song.</p><p>The match itself saw a stirring rendition of \"<em>Yma o Hyd at Kybunpark,</em>\" and once the match begun the Welsh chants of \"Don't Take me Home\" were matched by England's new Sarina Wiegman-inspired chant, where they've adopted The Champs' 1958 song \"Tequila\" to \"Sarina.\"</p><p>Watching on from the stands was Mary Earps, the former England No.1 goalkeeper. She retired on the eve of the tournament and witnessed Hannah Hampton keep her second clean sheet in as many matches. England head through, but the Welsh fans will be missed. -- <em>Hamilton</em></p><h3>Super Swiss</h3><p>Hosts Switzerland had an open training session in Bern on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.blick.ch/sport/fussball/frauen-fussball/frauen-nati/die-news-zur-nati-im-ticker-wieso-traegt-vallotto-beim-einmarsch-eine-kamera-id20977372.html\" target=\"_blank\">and A LOT of fans came out to see them</a>. In fact, there were about 3,000, which is hugely impressive given the event was only announced publicly last night!</p><p>A quarterfinal with world champions Spain awaits, so the fans will want to savor every moment. -- <em>Marsden</em></p><h3>Proud Pantalon</h3><p>Poland's debut at the Euros may have ended this weekend, but it did so with a performance that created history and, as coach Nina Pantalon pointed out, deserved to be celebrated late into the night.</p><p>Pantalon's side were competing in the tournament for the first time ever and registered their first and points in the finals in Saturday's brilliant 3-2 win against 2017 runners-up Denmark.</p><p>\"It's a great feeling,\" Pantalon said. \"We were so looking forward to that final whistle. Those emotions are still with me and will probably stay with me for the rest of my life. After the game, we'll go back to the hotel, have dinner, and then we'll see ...

The players trained on Saturday morning and were then given until Monday off to disconnect ahead of Friday's meeting with the hosts.</p><p>The players took advantage of the time off to get out and explore the picturesque surroundings around their base in Lausanne. There were train rides down Lake Geneva to more remote spots outside the city; some headed to Frience, an outdoor spot known for its natural swimming pools above the village of Leysin; and others even crossed the lake into France.</p><p>\"It's supper important to disconnect,\" forward Salma Paralluelo said. \"We have several days before the quarterfinal and it's a moment to make some plans and enjoy ourselves off the pitch.\"</p><p>When they return to training on Monday, coach Montse Tomé will give them the lowdown on Switzerland. With her coaching staff, she spent the weekend getting to grips with Pia Sundhage's side. \"Just a little,\" she smiled when asked if she was going to allow herself any time off. -- <em>Marsden</em></p><h3>A special birthday</h3><p>There will also be celebrations when Spain get back to work on Monday as Lucia García turns 27. It will be a rare birthday for the Monterrey striker as she gets to be the centre of attention -- which is not usually the case back at home as she is a quadruplet.</p><p>\"I have good memories of birthdays with my three brothers, albeit with very few presents,\" she joked in an interview with ESPN. \"One between us ... maybe one each. But we have shared incredible moments. I don't think many people can say they share their birthday with three siblings!\"</p><p>But does she have anything special planned to mark the occasion?</p><p>\"My teammates will bring out a cake, everyone will sing and I'll say a few words,\" she said. \"I still haven't thought what I will say. A few phrases and that will be that.\" -- <em>Marsden</em></p><hr><h2>Star player of the day</h2><h3>Delphine Cascarino</h3><p>Cascarino set up France's equalizer after they fell 2-1 behind to the Dutch and the San Diego Wave winger then netted a superb strike to put her side ahead. She wasn't done, though, adding a second just two minutes later after Marie-Antoinette Katoto's shot bounced off the post and the rebound fell to the 28-year-old. -- <em>Hamilton</em></p>\n</div></div>"

Norway have also impressed, but apart from the usual big dogs of Spain and France, Sweden are creeping up very nicely.</p><p><strong>Keogh</strong>: Italy. Progression from Group B behind Spain was not guaranteed as both <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f1a6de89-2405-3d20-9670-e5136704a849\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=9531\">Portugal</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5e3e3e5d-b558-35d7-a2db-31a927200984\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=18736\">Belgium</a> have quality, so the <em>Azzurre</em> have done well to reach the quarterfinals for the first time since 2013. They've flown under the radar in recent years but finally seem to be coming into some good form.</p><p><strong>Lindop</strong>: Sweden. Despite the considerable quality and experience in their squad, they hadn't been discussed among the favorites to win the tournament. However, after winning all three of their group games, I think they could be ones to watch. The fact that manager Peter Gerhardsson is set to depart could also have a galvanizing effect on the squad.</p><p><strong>Laurens</strong>: France, without a doubt. I didn't see three wins from three coming.<em> Les Bleues </em>had some momentum coming into the tournament, with eight victories in a row between the Nations League and friendlies, but they were so impressive against England and showed in the second half against Netherlands that when <a data-player-guid=\"8a2200c8-ed5b-ff35-93e1-e1c852cb4cf9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/252367/grace-geyoro\">Grace Geyoro</a> is on the pitch and spirits are high, they can be unplayable. Coach Laurent Bonadei has rotated a lot and France are in a strong position.</p><p><strong>Marsden</strong>: I am still dining out on saying Sweden would win their group, so I can't say them given my lofty expectations! I'll go for France. I think their performance against England was possibly the most impressive we have seen so far. They rotated against <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"11f4f7ba-8557-3081-99e4-8163a2599820\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=12634\">Wales</a> and wobbled against Netherlands, but they are so good in attack when it clicks. <a data-player-guid=\"b65a6077-a7e6-8d75-55b9-011327d5783d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/248830/delphine-cascarino\">Delphine Cascarino</a> has been superb.

Manager Andries Jonker caused controversy early on and ended up having a verbal slanging match with a journalist before the tournament even started, and even though they played well against Wales, they were dismal against England. They had their moments against France but -- even though it was a tough group -- it was clear the team are ready for a new coach.</p><p><strong>Keogh</strong>: I had high hopes for <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4ab03e32-960c-459e-f9a1-b62c3901f0c4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=3683\">Iceland</a>, but their failure to pick up a point shows that expectation was misplaced. They lost their three games by either one- or two-goal margins, rather than a host of tough drubbings, which is a small positive to take. But as the highest-ranked side in Group A (14th), a better showing was expected from them.</p><p><strong>Lindop</strong>: <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"614c2892-68ef-2595-b8ba-1e47a3afd030\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2896\">Denmark</a> have been really disappointing. Of course, they were in a tough group with Germany and Sweden however, even against Poland (a side 15 places below them in the FIFA World Ranking), they failed to pick up a single point. Considering some of the big names they have within their squad, including <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"acc95eff-24e5-3654-8716-e52356d02233\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=20103\">Bayern Munich</a> forward <a data-player-guid=\"3c1c5d68-a26b-9287-cf4b-7edbd34bd2bf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/258830/pernille-harder\">Pernille Harder</a>, it's been a really poor tournament.</p><p><strong>Laurens</strong>: Germany, for me. They missed loads of chances vs. Poland but were also unbalanced tactically. Losing captain <a data-player-guid=\"649bc85e-ef6c-85ed-5832-b169dca8c86d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/268102/giulia-gwinn\">Giulia Gwinn</a> to a serious injury just 40 minutes into the tournament was a blow, then they struggled to get their game going against Denmark, before Sweden destroyed them. You can never count Germany out of any competition, but despite all the attacking talent they have, they have been underwhelming so far.</p><p><strong>Marsden</strong>: Realistically, Netherlands were probably third favorites in their group, but the manner of their defeats to England and France will have been hard to take for the 2017 winners. I am also not completely sold on Germany; Poland created chances against them, Denmark took the lead in their second game and Sweden comfortably beat them in their final match.</p><h3>Which player has impressed you most?</h3><p><strong>Hamilton</strong>: <strong><a data-player-guid=\"2144667f-1168-ce75-7e69-96d814362a8e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/219995/alexia-putellas\">Alexia Putellas</a>.</strong> She's playing football from another planet for Spain, so she's the clear No. 1 pick. But Cascarino has been immense for France, while it was a joy watching <a data-player-guid=\"2a2e347a-b77a-3c78-871d-0b6f3fd5940a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/374917/signe-gaupset\">Signe Gaupset</a>'s breakthrough match for Norway. From an England point of view, <a data-player-guid=\"2e9eabcb-2aaf-154d-486a-3625da84c2e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/294253/lauren-james\">Lauren James</a> was unplayable against Netherlands and Wales, but England's most consistent player has been <a data-player-guid=\"4d853184-f7e7-36a9-a3bd-a56637c20fb8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/263683/alessia-russo\">Alessia Russo</a>. Her work rate and selflessness has helped them into the quarterfinals.</p><p><strong>Keogh</strong>: <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/317719/jule-brand\" target=\"_blank\">Jule Brand</a>. </strong>Though she's been around the Germany set up for a very long time, she has claimed her spot in midfield and is making it count. She's been involved in four of the five goals (two assists, two goals) in the campaign and has really impressed with her tenacity and passing. She's made a lot of Germany's attacks look seamless and with a tough tie against France in the quarterfinals, she will be a key figure if they are to reach the semifinals.</p><p><strong>Lindop</strong>: <strong><a data-player-guid=\"2416c090-eedc-06d4-4e7b-3238171cdc9f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257466/geraldine-reuteler\">Géraldine Reuteler</a>.</strong> Representing your country at a home Euros always comes with added pressure, but all-action midfielder Reuteler has made it look easy, winning three consecutive Player of the Match awards to help Switzerland book their place in the quarterfinals for the first time in their history. If Pia Sundhage's side are to get past world champions Spain and make it into the semifinals, Reuteler will almost certainly have something to with it.</p><p><strong>Laurens</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/140019/kosovare-asllani\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Kosovare Asllani</strong></a>. Putellas is the main one here, but Asllani has been amazing. She has led Sweden at the age of 35 with three assists and a goal, while reaching the milestone of 200 caps while in Switzerland. One of the legends of the game, it has been great to see her shine at the tail end of her career.</p><p><strong>Marsden</strong>: <strong>Alexia Putellas. </strong>It feels reductive to pick just one! As Beth says, Reuteler is a nice story as the star of the home nation, but it's hard to look past Putellas. It's not just the sheer numbers (three goals, four assists), but the quality she's producing as well: the feint inside for her goal against Portugal, the deft touch to finish against Belgium, the backheel assist Italy. She's been phenomenal. France's Cascarino is my second pick and also a nod to England's James; she has not hit the levels of the others consistently yet, but she's one of the players I'd back to do something special when needed.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45711918\" data-cerebro-id=\"68702e69ac2b6424ea6294ca\" data-title=\"How Switzerland saved their Euro 2025 hopes\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_T2V_Analysis_How_Switzerland_saved_their_Euro_2025_hopes_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45711918\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:52</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>How Switzerland saved their Euro 2025 hopes</p><p>Take a look at the numbers behind Switzerland's 1-1 draw against Finland to secure their spot in the Euro 2025 quarterfinals at their home tournament.</p></div></div><h3>What has been your favorite aspect of the tournament so far?</h3><p><strong>Hamilton</strong>: It's a toss up between the fans and goals. I only got glimpses of the Netherlands and Wales fans, but both were magnificent and brought so much to the tournament. Spending time with the Wales fans in St. Gallen was brilliant, and that memory will stay with me. James' goal for England against the Dutch -- including goalkeeper <a data-player-guid=\"aee7eff1-0afc-323c-81de-b23057f3293c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/312460/hannah-hampton\">Hannah Hampton</a>'s long pass -- was superb, while it's also been great seeing the number of Switzerland jerseys worn both on matchdays and during the week.</p><p><strong>Keogh</strong>: The fans have been incredible. The general atmosphere at games has been a joy to watch, people of all ages donning shirts, chanting, waving flags, and belting out songs. Even when Wales were facing defeat in the first game, the fans began singing the national anthem, and when France netted three goals in six minutes against Netherlands, St Jakob's Park was electric. Seeing so many fans (both travelling and local) get behind the sport has been fantastic to see.</p><p><strong>Lindop</strong>: The passion of the fans has really blown me away. It's been really special to see the Switzerland supporters, in particular, getting behind their team. Travelling from Zurich to Geneva ahead of Switzerland's final group game and seeing the number of fans in red shirts on their way to watch Sundhage's side at Stade de Geneve was a highlight.</p><p><strong>Laurens</strong>: The level of football has been really good. We have had loads of goals and some beautiful ones, great games, intensity, interesting tactical aspects, top coaching (and not so great sometimes), nice stories to tell our readers and the fans all around have been amazing too. This will be a Euros to remember.</p><p><strong>Marsden</strong>: The goals. There have been so many (3.7 per game), but more importantly there have been some absolute belters. This is far from an exhaustive list but if you get the chance, seek out these five: <a data-player-guid=\"637e6b5f-6841-399d-ac28-382e6e7a3bc4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/320355/athenea-del-castillo\">Athenea del Castillo</a> (vs. Italy), <a data-player-guid=\"5bc31e64-4bde-256e-e6e0-823a05b3a423\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/295641/claudia-pina\">Clàudia Pina</a> (vs. Belgium), Cascarino (vs. Netherlands), <a data-player-guid=\"ed5133ac-6094-5001-74bd-ac7dcdc88f01\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/255464/cristiana-girelli\">Cristiana Girelli</a> (vs. Portugal) and Brand (vs. Poland).</p><h3>What's the best quarterfinal? And give us a prediction for the final -- who will make it?</h3><p><strong>Hamilton</strong>: France vs. Germany will be a lot of fun, while Switzerland vs. Spain will be a great occasion. Norway vs. Italy is perhaps the least glamorous out of the four, but should be an enthralling contest, and Sweden vs. England is nicely balanced. Sweden have been one of the outstanding sides in the competition so if they can overcome England you'd bet on them meeting Spain in the final.</p><p><strong>Keogh</strong>: France vs. Germany is a quarterfinal of two European powerhouses which could almost be a final in itself. Both have a point to prove after underperforming in recent tournaments and both are going to be without key players. It feels like the most even matchup between two top sides, which is incredibly hard to call. But the winners will face world champions Spain and it's hard to see them losing.</p><p><strong>Lindop</strong>: Sweden vs. England looks the tastiest match for me. When these two sides met at the last Euros, the Lionesses won emphatically, however I have a feeling it's going to be a much closer contest this time around. I think England might just edge it and end up facing Spain in the final.</p><p><strong>Laurens</strong>: France vs. Germany has the best rivalry -- historically, socially and football wise. The two teams wanted to avoid each other as long as possible, but will meet in the quarterfinals. However, the winners will lose to Spain in the semifinals because no one can compete with the world champions. And you'd bet on Spain to beat England in the final and write even more history.</p><p><strong>Marsden</strong>: The hosts (Switzerland) against the favorites (Spain) offers a nice narrative, but the blockbuster ties are Sweden vs. England and France vs. Germany. I'm most looking forward to the latter. I think France will get the better of Germany, but lose to Spain ... paving the way for a repeat of the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/league/_/name/fifa.wwc\" target=\"_blank\">World Cup</a> final between Spain and England.</p>\n</div></div>"

In fact, the model is up over $8,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.</p><p>This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- and the 2025 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">sports betting</a>&nbsp;picks could have seen massive returns on&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a></span>.

The 36-year-old is now a five-time major champion and is one of only six golfers to complete the modern grand slam after winning the 2025 Masters. He's also the 2014 Open Championship winner, but he didn't fare well while facing enormous pressure at Royal Portrush in 2019.</p><p>The Northern Irishman missed the cut at the first Open Championship played in Northern Ireland in nearly 70 years despite being the betting and rooting favorite. He's also failed to crack the top five in each of the five solo events that he's played since winning at Augusta and missed the cut at last year's Open Championship.</p>\n        \n\n<p>The model has also locked in its projection for Scottie Scheffler, who is now a three-time major champion after winning the PGA Championship earlier this year. Scheffler didn't capture his first PGA Tour win until Feb. 2022 at the WM Phoenix Open, but he climbed to No. 1 in the world ranking later that season. Just 41 months later, he's now a 16-time PGA Tour winner and three-time major champion.</p><p>However, Open Championship golf has been a test for the American. In four career starts in golf's oldest major, Scheffler hasn't finished better than T-7, and he finished outside the top 20 in two of those attempts. He's also cooled off a little since recording his third win of the season at the Memorial Tournament, finishing T-7 at the U.S. Open and T-6 at the Travelers Championship.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the model has examined Bryson DeChambeau's chances of winning a third major. The 31-year-old has piled up 14 worldwide wins, and he's helped modernize the game in more ways than one, with single-length clubs, an analytical style and an army of social media followers. He's also become one of the biggest major championship threats in golf, with six top-six finishes in majors the last three seasons and two major wins.</p>\n        \n\n<p>However, he's coming off a missed cut at the U.S. Open, and he's also struggled to adapt to links golf. He's missed the cut in three of his seven career starts at Open Championships and has only recorded one top-25 finish, though it was a respectable T-8 in 2022. He's a different player since missing the cut at Royal Portrush in 2019, but will his playing style work in an Open Championship setting?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-picks-odds-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-predictions-for-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-and-others/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipNames\" target=\"_blank\">See the full Open Championship projections from the model here</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship  picks</h2><p>The model is targeting five golfers with odds longer than 20-1 who will make a strong run at the Claret Jug.

We’ll give you glorious weather and decent crowds that fill some grounds and provide a fine atmosphere at the others. We’ll give you fanbases rooted in their local communities and club histories stretching back well over a century. We’ll give you tickets that are easy to buy online or available at walk-up box offices. We’ll provide 21st-century stadium facilities and, though there can be a bit of edge (as there should be), well-stewarded matches where everyone is safe.</p><p>We’ll roll in some international players: Phil Salt, Liam Livingstone, Jos Buttler, Luke Wood, Saqib Mahmood, Jimmy Anderson, Dan Lawrence, Will Jacks, Jason Roy, Sam Curran, Ollie Pope, Tom Curran, Mitchell Santner, Chris Jordan, Jamie Overton, Reece Topley and Adam Zampa. And that’s just at Lancashire and Surrey. There are plenty more names elsewhere.</p><p>The Blast is undersold, undermined and, consequently, goes under the radar. How the hell did we get here?</p></li><li data-spacefinder-role=\"nested\"><hr><h2 id=\"unease-at-essex\"><span>2. </span>Unease at Essex</h2><p>There has been some fine cricket played in the tournament and, with a couple of rounds left, 14 of 18 starters still have a chance of winning it. Some have rather more of a chance than others, of course.</p><p>The contrast in fortunes between those dreaming of Finals Day and those sleepwalking towards the group stage conclusion was illustrated at Taunton, where a high-flying Somerset marmalised a demoralised Essex by 95 runs.</p><p>Anyone can run into Tom Kohler-Cadmore on his day (90 off 39 balls) and take harsh punishment, but how have Essex managed to win just two of their 12 matches? One feels that the inherent randomness of the T20 format, with its inevitable swinging from the hip, should produce something better than that, almost regardless of form, talent and morale.</p><p>That no batter averages 30 and no bowler goes at under 8.5 per over speaks to a performance issue, but Essex have also won only one Championship match this season. To reach mid-July with just three victories suggests more than just onfield problems.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-spacefinder-role=\"nested\"><hr><h2 id=\"its-donald-duck\"><span>3. </span>It’s Donald – duck!</h2><p>How often have you looked up and, to your surprise, found that Joe Root is on 28, acquired while you were searching for those cheese and jalapeño pickle sandwiches you were sure you hadn’t left in the fridge?</p><p>I had the same feeling when I looked up Aneurin Donald and learned that the one-time boy wonder and teenage record-breaker was now 28 years old and fetched up at Derbyshire. The talent never hides for long though, despite a career that has not scaled the heights it once promised.</p><p>Northamptonshire must have been confident at the innings break at Wantage Road, having set a target of 238 with half-centuries from Matthew Breetzke, David Willey and Saif Zaib. Donald dented that with his 22-ball stay that produced eight fours and six sixes, his 71 coming at a strike rate of 323! It was somehow fitting that no teammates could hit at much above half that rate and his pyrotechnics came in a lost cause.</p><figure id=\"58689270-74bf-4225-8e65-6f31b3af5fcd\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7d96b40c328a60e7c12c9d6005c30d9c95e7a9/0_0_3087_1975/master/3087.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7d96b40c328a60e7c12c9d6005c30d9c95e7a9/0_0_3087_1975/master/3087.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7d96b40c328a60e7c12c9d6005c30d9c95e7a9/0_0_3087_1975/master/3087.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7d96b40c328a60e7c12c9d6005c30d9c95e7a9/0_0_3087_1975/master/3087.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7d96b40c328a60e7c12c9d6005c30d9c95e7a9/0_0_3087_1975/master/3087.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7d96b40c328a60e7c12c9d6005c30d9c95e7a9/0_0_3087_1975/master/3087.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Aneurin Donald, the one-time boy wonder, is now playing for Derbyshire.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7d96b40c328a60e7c12c9d6005c30d9c95e7a9/0_0_3087_1975/master/3087.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"284.70197602850664\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Aneurin Donald, the one-time boy wonder, is now playing for Derbyshire.</span> Photograph: George Wood/ECB/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></li><li data-spacefinder-role=\"nested\"><hr><h2 id=\"form-goes-out-the-window-in-a-derby\"><span>4. </span>Form goes out the window in a derby</h2><p>Top against bottom in the North Group, with Lancashire flying high and enjoying home advantage against a Yorkshire team with nothing to play for. A home banker surely?</p><p>Nobody told Bradford’s Jonny Bairstow (116) or Keighley’s Will Luxton (90), each of whose 17 sixes plucked a petal from the red rose as it wilted under the onslaught. Lancashire’s hired hands were spirited in their reply, but the two Tykes, backed up by a couple of wickets from Leeds’ Jordan Thompson, had done enough. It was a shock result that wasn’t really a shock at all.</p></li><li data-spacefinder-role=\"nested\"><hr><p>Danny Lamb is almost a reverse Aneurin Donald – it’s amazing to see that he’s still in his 20s. Now at Sussex, he enjoys the classic “bits and pieces” player’s stats, averaging between 30 and 33 across all three formats with the ball and 29 and 35 with the bat (OK, 15 in T20, but it would be 30 if he spent more time at the crease).</p><p>He showed his value in his team’s short trip to Canterbury, where he made only seven off 12 batting but, on as fourth change, he dismissed key men Daniel Bell-Drummond and Joe Denly then cleaned up the tail for a fivefer.</p><p>It’s easy to look down on the quasi all-rounders (those who would not get in the XI for either of their skills) but they are easy to relate to and easy to love because they’re always in the game. The Darren Stevens tribute acts will always have a place in the hearts of county cricket fans.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-spacefinder-role=\"nested\"><hr><h2 id=\"farhans-far-out-finish\"><span>6. </span>Farhan’s far out finish</h2><p>Though it does not find favour with readers, this column does advocate exploring tweaks to the Blast’s playing regulations to promote more tight finishes. Too many matches are won well before the tension that only a last-over finish can provide. Lots of options would be available, but I’d quite like a wildcard allowing the captain to call upon his best bowler for a fifth over any time in the last six.</p><p>They did get a thriller at Trent Bridge when Leicestershire made the short trip north and racked up a solid 188 for two. Joe Clarke, as he does, got the Nottinghamshire chase off to a good start and all looked well when Tom Moores hit the first two deliveries of the 18th over for six, leaving 10 to get off 16 balls.</p><p>But it’s best not to get out if you’re the set batter, and Moores did, to leave the last three wickets to get over the line. Liam Patterson-White couldn’t get enough of the strike and when he was out, No 11 Farhan Ahmed walked to the crease with two balls to face and two runs to get. The 17-year-old got it into the offside and set off on a harum-scarum attempt at two runs. With shouts coming from both sides of the boundary, the kid got home amid the chaos and the win was secured, nine down. Now that’s a finish.</p></li><hr></ol></figure><p><em><strong>This article is from <a href=\"http://nestaquin.wordpress.com/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">The 99.94 Cricket Blog</a></strong></em></p></div></div>"

It'll be a homecoming for Rory McIlroy, who will be looking for both his second British Open title and his second major win of the season after winning the Masters in April. The latest 2025 Open Championship odds via FanDuel list McIlroy as the second favorite at +700.</p><p>PGA Championship winner Scottie Scheffler is the +450 favorite in the latest PGA odds. Other top Open Championship contenders include Jon Rahm (+1200) and Bryson DeChambeau (+2000), with reigning British Open champion Xander Schauffele (+2500) and Ludvig Aberg (+2800) also in the mix. Scottish Open champion Chris Gotterup is a +9000 longshot.&nbsp;Before locking in your 2025 Open Championship picks, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship\" target=\"_blank\">see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.</p><p>This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- and the 2025 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">sports betting</a> picks could have seen massive returns on <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a></span>.

McIlroy won The Open in 2014 but missed the cut in his last Open Championship start a year ago. He also missed the cut in his only other visit to Royal Portrush, which came at the 2019 British Open.</p><p>Since completing the career Grand Slam at the Masters earlier this year, McIlroy's form hasn't kept pace in his ensuing major starts or on the PGA Tour as a whole. He finished 47th at the PGA Championship and 19th at the U.S. Open, marking just the second time over the last dozen years he had finishes outside the top 15 in consecutive major starts. He's not a strong pick to win it all, and there are far better values in the 2025 Open Championship field.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to fade here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Another surprise: Justin Thomas, a 50-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The British Open has traditionally not been the strongest event for Thomas, who is still looking for his first career top-10 finish in this tournament.</p><p>Thomas, however, has been playing some of his best golf of the past few years recently. He won the RBC Heritage, a Signature Event, in April. He also recorded top-10 finishes at the Travelers Championship and the Truist Championship since that point. The model has identified him as a top-10 contender at Royal Portrush, making him a strong pick for Open outright and top-10 bets.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-projected-leaderboard-surprising-predictions/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionship\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to pick here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>The model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 22-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title.

The trio’s arrival will inflate the number of Lions on tour to a whopping 44 with Owen Farrell, Ben White, Jamie Osborne and, most recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/12/jamie-george-lions-luke-cowan-dickie-garry-ringrose-first-australia-test\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Jamie George</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/13/rugby-union-lions-andy-farrell-australia-joe-schmidt-ian-foster\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Thomas Clarkson</a> having already been added to the party.</p><p>Back in 2017 when Warren Gatland called up six additional players – Allan Dell, Finn Russell, Kristian Dacey, Tomas Francis, Cory Hill and Gareth Davies – there was unhappiness within the squad that selection had been driven by geographical convenience rather than merit.</p><figure id=\"d20f5063-4484-45a1-9067-7205dbaa45b2\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Jamie George called up as Lions lose Cowan-Dickie and Ringrose for first Australia Test&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d20f5063-4484-45a1-9067-7205dbaa45b2&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/12/jamie-george-lions-luke-cowan-dickie-garry-ringrose-first-australia-test&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure><p>All three Scottish players had been preparing to face Samoa in New Zealand on Friday but, in this case, the Lions management say that geography was not the overriding factor. Sutherland was a Lion in South Africa four years ago where he played in six matches including two of the Tests, Graham was a strong candidate to join the squad in the first place and Ashman has won the nod over Wales’s Dewi Lake.</p><p>The number of extra bodies being bussed in, nevertheless, once more calls into question the wisdom of scheduling midweek tour games in between Test matches in the modern era. In 2017 some original Lions players were also upset on behalf of certain teammates who had narrowly missed out on initial selection only to be leapfrogged by less talented players who were simply lucky be located slightly closer.</p><p>The public backlash was so intense that Warren Gatland chose not to use all the members of the “Geography Six” as replacements, with only Russell and Dell eventually making it on to the pitch. This time it would appear the Lions management have sought to stagger the call-up announcements slightly and skipper Maro Itoje insists all the Scots will be warmly greeted. “I have no doubt they will be welcomed,” said Itoje, preparing to lead the Lions in to Saturday’s first Test. “The boss has called them in because he believes they will help the Lions to achieve their goal of winning a Test series. All the players that have been called in are quality players.</p><p>“They have a high level of experience and have achieved things in their career. We are all in this together. It’s not us and them. It doesn’t matter if there’s a late call-up. We’ve seen in the past how late call-ups have had huge impact on the tour in positive ways. I have no doubt that everyone who has called up will play a significant role in helping the team achieve its goal.”</p><p>Assistant coach John Dalziel also insisted the Lions were “not giving away opportunities lightly” but admitted the additional players could be released again after the game against the First Nations &amp; Pasifika XV in Melbourne next Tuesday. “There’s always been a plan in place and we’ve made the right one based on what we have,” said Dalziel. At least one member of the 2017 squad declined to talk to the six new arrivals eight years ago but Dalziel believes there will be no repeat this time. “I didn’t hear those stories, but I’d like to think our lads would be above that,” he said.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-9\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-9\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Ashman, who plays his club rugby for Edinburgh, has won 28 Scotland caps to date and made his international debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/07/scotland-australia-autumn-international-rugby-union-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">in November 2021 against Australia</a>. Graham has played for Scotland for seven years and has scored 31 tries in 47 Tests, although he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/12/rugby-union-wales-japan-scotland-fiji-france-all-blacks\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">sent off last Saturday</a> for collecting two yellow cards against Fiji. No ban has been forthcoming, however, so the wing has been free to fly in and join the Lions camp.</p><p>The weekend call-up for the Ireland prop Clarkson, meanwhile, has further bolstered the sizable Leinster presence on the tour to 14 while Itoje was also quizzed about the publicly-expressed aim by Henry Pollock and other Lions players that they want to hammer Australia 3-0 in the Test series. “If you were to ask any Wallabies players, I hope that’s their ambition too,” said Itoje. “Obviously we want to win every game we play but all we’re focused on is this Saturday. The other two games will look after themselves.”</p></div></div>"

Atlanta's Matt Olson will be the fan favorite, but Seattle's <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/\">Cal Raleigh</a>, is the betting favorite. However, a pair of 22-year-olds in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911704/james-wood/\">James Wood</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28839811/junior-caminero/\">Junior Caminero</a> will want to put on a show before playing in their first All-Star Games the next night. The MLB HR Derby will see seven of the eight participants making their derby debuts, while Acuna is appearing for the third time. </p><p> The 2025 MLB HR Derby takes place at 8 p.m. ET, with each player seeing 40 pitches in the first round. Four will then advance to the semifinals, in which they'll be seeded based on first-round performance, before the two winners then advance to the final which consists of 27 pitches. Raleigh is the +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300) in the 2025 MLB Home Run Derby odds, followed by <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2822182/oneil-cruz/\">Oneil Cruz</a> (+330) and Wood (+400). Olson, who replaced Ronald Acuna Jr. in the field, is a longshot at +900. The over/under for total homers in the Home Run Derby is 240.5.

A switch hitter, Raleigh has indicated that he'll hit from both sides of the plate in the derby, which is something only <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117469/adley-rutschman/\">Adley Rutschman</a> (2023) has done in the event's history. Rutschman failed to advance past the first round when he 20 homers left-handed and then seven more right-handed two years ago, and Severance isn't a fan of Raleigh attempting the feat. Of hitting from both sides of the plate at a Home Run Derby, Severance says, \"That seems a little complicated.\"</p><p>While Raleigh grew up close to Atlanta in North Carolina, he's not familiar with Truist Park, with just two prior games and four at-bats at the ballpark. That's the second fewest in the field, only behind Caminero who has never played in the venue, and those two are the only of the eight derby participants to never homer at Truist Park in an MLB game. Being unfamiliar with the dimensions, sightlines and shadows of Truist shouldn't be discounted for someone with the shortest odds.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Raleigh also has a couple of other factors working against him, with one being that no catcher has ever won the MLB Home Run Derby as it enters its 39th year. Perhaps the rigors of playing the position manifest in this type of event where stamina is important, as players could take over 100 swings if they advance to the final. Additionally, Raleigh doesn't enter the All-Star break playing his best as he hit over .300 in both May and June but is at a paltry .107 so far in July. Again, that could point to the demands of playing catcher as backstops usually see their numbers dip as the season goes on.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-mlb-home-run-derby-odds-picks-best-bets-and-predictions-for-mondays-all-star-game-event-from-proven-expert/#ttag=07112025_agg_cbssports_picks_baseball_mlb_Severance_MLBHRderby\" target=\"_blank\">See Severance's best bet for the 2025 Home Run Derby right here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to make 2025 Home Run Derby picks</h2><p>Severance has analyzed the 2025 Home Run Derby field and has locked in a best bet who he says \"might have the most power\" in this year's field.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-mlb-home-run-derby-odds-picks-best-bets-and-predictions-for-mondays-all-star-game-event-from-proven-expert/#ttag=07112025_agg_cbssports_picks_baseball_mlb_Severance_MLBHRderby\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get his pick and analysis at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So who wins the MLB Home Run Derby 2025? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-mlb-home-run-derby-odds-picks-best-bets-and-predictions-for-mondays-all-star-game-event-from-proven-expert/#ttag=07112025_agg_cbssports_picks_baseball_mlb_Severance_MLBHRderby\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine to see Severance's top 2025 Home Run Derby picks, all from the MLB expert who has returned nearly $1,700 on his MLB picks</a>, and find out.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>2025 MLB Home Run Derby odds, participants</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-mlb-home-run-derby-odds-picks-best-bets-and-predictions-for-mondays-all-star-game-event-from-proven-expert/#ttag=07112025_agg_cbssports_picks_baseball_mlb_Severance_MLBHRderby\" target=\"_blank\">See 2025 MLB Home Run Derby picks here</a></p>\n        \n\n<p>Cal Raleigh +300<br>Oneil Cruz +330<br>James Wood +400<br>Byron Buxton +850<br>Matt Olson +900<br>Junior Caminero +950<br>Brent Rooker +1000<br>Jazz Chisholm +1400</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

They matched England’s Euro 2022 record of 14 goals in the group stage. Alexia Putellas is continuing her charge for the Ballon d’Or with three goals and four assists and has lit up their midfield while the 18-year-old Vicky López has impressed in her first major tournament. While in sensational form going forward, their defence does leave opportunities for their opposition. They will be favourites to win the quarter-final against hosts Switzerland but it will be a mouth-watering occasion in Bern.</p><h2 id=\"2-sweden\">2) Sweden</h2><p>Sweden were undeniably impressive in the group stage. While Denmark caused them a few issues in their opening win, Peter Gerhardsson’s side truly got their title challenge up and running with a comprehensive victory over Poland and a demolition of Germany. That marked their first Euros win over the Germans in six attempts. Spreading goals around the team is a bonus but the defence remains their weakness, particularly when against pace. Nevertheless, they go into the quarter-finals unbeaten in 15 matches and full of confidence.</p><h2 id=\"3-france\">3) France</h2><p>France caught the eye by outplaying England in their Group D opener and they look like a team on an unbeaten run. The manner of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/netherlands-france-womens-euro-2025-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">comeback against the Netherlands</a> will only have helped their confidence. The strength of their wide play is second to none with Sandy Baltimore and Delphine Cascarino in good form. Their No 9 Marie-Antoinette Katoto has also opened her account for the tournament, putting to bed the ghosts of Euro 2022 where she suffered an ACL injury. As with many sides in this tournament, they have defensive frailties that can be exploited as all three opponents in the group showed.</p><gu-island name=\"InteractiveBlockComponent\" priority=\"critical\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=france&amp;player=20&quot;,&quot;scriptUrl&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Cascarino&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:2},&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;41e6ae36-a599-4f22-9cdf-4e08af3db35e&quot;,&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false}\"><figure id=\"41e6ae36-a599-4f22-9cdf-4e08af3db35e\" data-alt=\"Cascarino\" data-testid=\"interactive-element-Cascarino\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><a data-name=\"placeholder\" href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=france&amp;player=20\">Cascarino</a></figure></gu-island><h2 id=\"4-england\">4) England</h2><p>England started the tournament slowly with defeat by France but have started to click into gear. For Sarina Wiegman’s side it was more the manner of that opening performance that was disappointing, but they have since put things right. A couple of tweaks to their game plan and they scored a combined 10 goals against the Netherlands and Wales. Lauren James is showing exactly what she is about on this major stage while Ella Toone is playing some of the best football of her career. The Lionesses still look frail defensively, especially when faced with a strong transitional side.</p><h2 id=\"5-norway\">5) Norway</h2><p>Progressing with three wins from three looks impressive but when you delve into Norway’s performances things look a little less rosy. Gemma Grainger’s side were expected to top Group A but they have struggled for cohesion. Switzerland and Finland both gave them a scare but the experience and quality of Ada Hegerberg and Caroline Graham Hansen came through. With Italy up next, they will feel they have a chance to progress deep into the competition.</p><figure id=\"4925b28e-dc60-411a-9460-e18955b11c9a\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Caroline Graham Hansen (middle) celebrates with captain Ada Hegerberg after scoring against Finland.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1055f908441085dfb2bda7ac6a508069d5273c/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Caroline Graham Hansen (middle) celebrates with captain Ada Hegerberg after scoring against Finland.</span> Photograph: Mathias Bergeld/BILDBYRÅN/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"6-germany\">6) Germany</h2><p>The manner of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/sweden-germany-womens-euro-2025-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">4-1 drubbing by Sweden</a> will have left a sour taste before the quarter-finals. Two wins from two before that meeting in Zurich got the job done for Christian Wück’s side but they have not looked convincing, particularly defensively. The loss of captain Giulia Gwinn to a medial ligament knee injury in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/germany-poland-womens-euro-2025-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">their opening victory against Poland</a> was a blow and they will now have to do without her back-up Carlotta Wamser for the next match after her brilliant impression of a goalkeeper earned her a straight red card.</p><h2 id=\"7-switzerland\">7) Switzerland</h2><p>Football fever has swept through Switzerland as Pia Sundhage’s team progressed to the European Championship knockouts for the first time. The hosts’ prospects looked uncertain given their indifferent form, but they have impressed, their youthful side embracing the opportunities of a major tournament. Captain and centurion Lia Wälti continues to lead by example while Géraldine Reuteler has stood out with three Player of the Match winning performances. A dramatic injury-time equaliser from Riola Xhemaili against Finland to send them through only added to the fairytale.</p><h2 id=\"8-italy\">8) Italy</h2><p>Andrea Soncin’s side were many people’s dark horses coming into the tournament, and without setting the world alight, they have impressed in reaching the knockouts for the first time since 2013. An edgy win over Belgium after a wonder goal by Arianna Caruso got their campaign up and running but was followed by a disappointing draw with Portugal, marked by wastefulness in front of goal. But they put in a strong showing in defeat by Spain, particularly in the first half, to show they can grow into the competition. A quarter-final encounter with Norway is a huge opportunity.</p><gu-island name=\"InteractiveBlockComponent\" priority=\"critical\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=italy&amp;player=18&quot;,&quot;scriptUrl&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Caruso&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:2},&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;6568dd89-5733-41b3-9d3a-a51f092dbe2d&quot;,&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false}\"><figure id=\"6568dd89-5733-41b3-9d3a-a51f092dbe2d\" data-alt=\"Caruso\" data-testid=\"interactive-element-Caruso\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><a data-name=\"placeholder\" href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=italy&amp;player=18\">Caruso</a></figure></gu-island><h2 id=\"9-finland\">9) Finland</h2><p>One of the surprise packages, Finland gained admiration for their inspired performances despite their elimination. An opening win over Iceland marked their first at a Euros in 16 years and represented a good achievement for Marko Saloranta and his side. Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/06/norway-finland-euro-2025-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">performance against Norway caught the eye</a> despite defeat as they put Gemma Grainger’s team under significant pressure. The manner of the draw against Switzerland was heartbreaking – an injury-time equaliser from the hosts knocked Helmarit out – but this developing squad will take so much from the experience.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-21\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-21\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><h2 id=\"10-netherlands\">10) Netherlands</h2><p>A campaign that started brightly soon descended into chaos. Their opening day win and the celebrations around Vivianne Miedema’s 100th goal seem like a distant memory after two dispiriting defeats by England and France. Group D was always going to be a challenge but to concede nine in two matches is a serious concern. There is disruption behind the scenes with Andries Jonker’s departure imminent – and there was a press room spat between him and a Dutch journalist. Then Daniëlle van de Donk initially said she had been fit after not starting against England, before backtracking, while the captain Miedema did not get on the pitch in their final match.</p><h2 id=\"11-belgium\">11) Belgium</h2><p>Belgium’s performances did not reveal anything that was not already known about Elísabet Gunnarsdóttir’s side – strength in transition and dangerous in attack but leaky in defence and lacking structure. That counterattacking strength proved fruitful at times and they exploited Spain admirably before being dismantled at the other end of the field. A final-day victory over Portugal to avoid finishing last in Group C added a gloss and the 25-year-old forward, Mariam Toloba, was a stand-out performer throughout.</p><figure id=\"929efa32-1737-4d97-b47f-60c3220d9d70\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Mariam Toloba in action against Portugal.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf2cf81eccf788c25a53aedd80ed4451cfe5f23/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.6923343138951\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Mariam Toloba in action against Portugal.</span> Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"12-poland\">12) Poland</h2><p>Poland’s first major tournament will have given the coach, Nina Patalon, and her team plenty of learnings and memories as they look to build. They achieved a series of firsts – Natalia Padilla-Bidas made history with their first goal on this stage while they held off a Danish comeback to secure their first win in the final game. The opening performance against Germany was admirable despite defeat. It is an exciting time for the women’s game in Poland and this outing, however brief, will help.</p><h2 id=\"13-portugal\">13) Portugal</h2><p>Francisco Neto’s side came into the tournament on a downward spiral that was made more emphatic by the manner of their emotional opening day defeat by Spain. There is no shame in losing to <em>La Roja</em> but the five goals conceded just illustrated how poor they have been defensively in 2025. Diana Gomes’s late equaliser against Italy provided one of the more dramatic games of the group stage. Perhaps a rethink is needed as they look to World Cup qualification<strong>.</strong></p><h2 id=\"14-denmark\">14) Denmark</h2><p>Group C was always going to be tough for the Danes but this was their worst Euros performance. It can’t have helped that the manager, Andrée Jeglertz, was announced as Manchester City’s new manager on the eve of their first game. Denmark looked bright in spells but never really mounted a challenge and toiled when Pernille Harder was marked out of a game. They managed to salvage a little pride with late fightback against Poland but still succumbed to defeat and it proved too little too late. A sad ending to Nadia Nadim’s career.</p><h2 id=\"15-wales\">15) Wales</h2><p>The lowest-ranked team in the tournament were always going to struggle in the Group of the Death. Rhian Wilkinson’s side did not get the luck of the draw in their major tournament bow. Despite three defeats, there will be plenty the Welsh can take back to Wales to try and back up this achievement. That their first goal in a European Championships was scored by Jess Fishlock seemed inevitable and the 38-year-old will now have a big decision to make about her future. Wilkinson pointed to the fitness gap between her side and the others while also making a rallying call to increase access to sport for girls in Wales.</p><h2 id=\"16-iceland\">16) Iceland</h2><p>If Fifa World rankings are a real measure of a team, Iceland would have been the favourites in Group A despite registering one win since July 2024. However, Hildur Antonsdóttir’s opening-day red card set the tone for a difficult campaign all round for Þorsteinn Halldórsson’s side, that saw them defeated three times. A late rally against Norway gives hope for the future but there is an overreliance on the talent of Sveindís Jónsdóttir. The 20-year-old forward Katla Tryggvadóttir looked bright on her major tournament debut.</p></div></div>"

president of leading players' global union Fifpro.</b></p><p>In a scathing statement, Sergio Marchi appeared to compare the world governing body's president Gianni Infantino to the Roman emperor Nero.</p><p>And he also claimed Fifa \"chose to continue increasing its revenue at the expense of the players' bodies and health\".</p><p>It comes after BBC Sport learned that Fifpro <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1lj92jqr67o\">was not invited</a> to a key meeting on player welfare that Infantino held on the eve of the Club World Cup final with representatives from other unions.</p><p>Last year, amid a backlash over the expansion of the Club World Cup, Fifpro <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c981203e61qo\">filed a legal complaint</a> against Fifa, claiming it had abused its role under European competition law by adding more pressure to the fixture schedule.</p><p>Fifa has denied the claims, and at the weekend Infantino called the tournament \"the most successful club competition in the world\".</p><p>But tensions have now intensified, with Fifpro president Marchi insisting that while the Club World Cup \"generated enthusiasm among numerous fans and allowed some of the world's leading figures to be seen in a single tournament… this competition hides a dangerous disconnect with the true reality faced by the majority of footballers around the world\".</p><p>Marchi added: \"What was presented as a global celebration of football was nothing more than a fiction created by Fifa, promoted by its president, without dialogue, sensitivity, and respect for those who sustain the game with their daily efforts.</p><p>\"A grandiloquent staging inevitably reminiscent of the 'bread and circuses' of Nero's Rome, entertainment for the masses while behind the scenes inequality, precariousness, and the lack of protection for the true protagonists deepen.\"</p><p>Fifth Roman emperor Nero threw spectacular games and events which made him popular with ordinary people, but is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/programmes/articles/4DwgbSMcR5WZcxYjC2p1c9Z/nero-to-zero-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-brutal-roman-emperor\">better remembered</a> for his brutality and cruelty.</p><p>Fifa has previously said all its revenues for the tournament will be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjrne75xdqjo\">redistributed back to the club game</a> for participating and non-participating teams.</p></div><div data-component=\"image-block\"><figure><p><span><picture><source

What happened cannot be repeated under any circumstances at next year's Fifa World Cup.</p><p>\"We have been warning about the overcrowded schedule, the lack of physical and mental rest for players, and the lack of dialogue on the part of Fifa. This way of organising tournaments, without listening to the federation that represents the world's professional footballers' associations, is unilateral, authoritarian, and based solely on a logic of economic profitability, not human sustainability.</p><p>\"We cannot continue to play with the health of players to fuel a marketing machine.

And neither, as it turns out, is Suaalii, who spoke to us at lunchtime on Monday in Brisbane at the start of Test week.</p><p>Does he remember the contretemps at Murrayfield? Oh yes. Does he wish to elaborate? Oh no.</p><p>\"There's been a lot of recounting of that day,\" he said. \"I feel like there's been a lot of talk around that moment. At the end of the day, like I said, it's a game of footy. Whatever's said on the field stays on the field. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to play. Not too much to say about that.\"</p><p>He didn't really need to say a whole lot because, on his face, you could tell that something lingers about that coming-together.</p><p>There was a line picked up by the microphones that day. As he left the field, incensed, Suaalii turned to Tuipulotu and said: \"See you next time.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Next time might be this Saturday. There's a reasonable chance that Suaalii and Tuipulotu might come face-to-face again <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cy7n1x24d0ro\">in the first Test in Brisbane</a>, one with the 13 on his back and the other wearing 12. Different positions but close enough to each other to do damage.</p><p>There's pressure everywhere, of course, but when you scan the internet and find endless commentary about how Suaalii is the \"salvation of Australian rugby\" then you start to learn about the expectation on this guy's shoulders.</p><p>He's five games into his Test career, but the eulogising has flown indiscriminately.</p><p>The great Tim Horan talks about his size, speed, his talent in the air and his incredible power.</p><p>\"He tackles like a leaguie [rugby league player], leaps like a basketballer and marks like an AFL player,\" Horan said. \"The Wallabies need pace, agility and deception with a 'no backward step' mentality and he embodies all that.\"</p><p>Kurtley Beale talks about his aura. Former Sydney Roosters team-mate Victor Radley calls him a \"freak\".</p><p>The director of rugby at his former school says that at 13, Suaalii was 6ft tall and a man playing against children. He's 6ft 5in now. A physical specimen on a deal worth a reported A$5m (£2.4m) over three years.</p><p>Amid a cross-code bidding war to tempt him away from the NRL, the Australian Rugby Union did not break the bank for Suaalii just to play well for the Waratahs in Super Rugby. His impact has to be way bigger than that, way more profound.</p><p>They emptied the tank so that he would help lead the Wallabies out of the darkness and into a brighter future and the Lions series is the first, and a major, part of that. He has to light up this series.</p></div><div data-component=\"image-block\"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"><img alt=\"Joseph Suaalii pictured on debut for Sydney Roosters in May 2021, accelerating away from a Brisbane Broncos players who tries to tackle him\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/3493/live/7eabf3f0-6094-11f0-83e5-c99758354894.jpg 976w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"></picture></span><span role=\"text\"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Suaalii made his NRL debut for Sydney Roosters when he was just 17</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>So, pressure, yes.

He first won The Open at Carnoustie 18 years ago, successfully defended the title at Royal Birkdale and then went to Oakland Hills and won the US PGA Championship.</p><p>Three major wins in 13 months. \"Padraig got the ball rolling,\" said McIlroy, who made his Open debut in 2007 and finished as the leading amateur. \"I think the other Irish players looked at that and that gave them belief.\"</p><p>Harrington, who last month won the US Senior's Open for the second time, continues to possess a competitive edge that sets him apart. \"I did two things,\" he said.</p><p>\"One, I always talked about majors, that I would win plural majors. I talked myself up.</p><p>\"But I think the second thing came a bit with my personality. A bit instinctively, I didn't realise I wasn't meant to win.</p><p>\"Whereas the guys who went before me thought, no, an Irish guy can't do that, I didn't have any ceiling on what was possible.</p><p>\"That's how I got through the amateur game.

Graeme McDowell won the US Open at Pebble Beach in 2010, and McIlroy kept the trophy in Northern Ireland the following year.</p><p>\"I would have helped the following on Irish guys,\" Harrington said. \"They could say, 'hang on a second, we were number one in the amateur game in Ireland. We played with Paddy. We know what he's like. I can do that.'\"</p><p>The ripple became a wave as Dungannon's Darren Clarke won the 2011 Open at Royal St George's and McIlroy claimed three more majors, including The Open by the end of 2014.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"We-knew-it-would-be-a-success\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">'We knew it would be a success'</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The 1998 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61968177\">Good Friday Agreement</a> - the deal that brought an end to 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles - opened up further possibilities.</p><p>McIlroy told me: \"That momentum that we all had was there at that period of time and in conjunction with the R&amp;A looking at Royal Portrush to potentially host the Open Championship again.</p><p>\"And then for it to go there, I think it's [down to] Irish golf and the players that have come through and how well that we've done.</p><p>\"But I also think it's a great representation of how far Northern Ireland has come in the last 30 or 40 years.</p><p>\"Because in the 70s and the 80s and the 90s, no one would have dreamed of hosting an Open Championship in Northern Ireland in those times.\"</p><p>Harrington agreed. \"Once it went there, we knew it would be a success,\" said the 53-year-old Dubliner.</p><p>\"We'd played a lot of amateur golf up there.

He first won The Open at Carnoustie 18 years ago, successfully defended the title at Royal Birkdale and then went to Oakland Hills and won the US PGA Championship.</p><p>Three major wins in 13 months. \"Padraig got the ball rolling,\" said McIlroy, who made his Open debut in 2007 and finished as the leading amateur. \"I think the other Irish players looked at that and that gave them belief.\"</p><p>Harrington, who last month won the US Senior's Open for the second time, continues to possess a competitive edge that sets him apart. \"I did two things,\" he said.</p><p>\"One, I always talked about majors, that I would win plural majors. I talked myself up.</p><p>\"But I think the second thing came a bit with my personality. A bit instinctively, I didn't realise I wasn't meant to win.</p><p>\"Whereas the guys who went before me thought, no, an Irish guy can't do that, I didn't have any ceiling on what was possible.</p><p>\"That's how I got through the amateur game.

Graeme McDowell won the US Open at Pebble Beach in 2010, and McIlroy kept the trophy in Northern Ireland the following year.</p><p>\"I would have helped the following on Irish guys,\" Harrington said. \"They could say, 'hang on a second, we were number one in the amateur game in Ireland. We played with Paddy. We know what he's like. I can do that.'\"</p><p>The ripple became a wave as Dungannon's Darren Clarke won the 2011 Open at Royal St George's and McIlroy claimed three more majors, including The Open by the end of 2014.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"We-knew-it-would-be-a-success\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">'We knew it would be a success'</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The 1998 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61968177\">Good Friday Agreement</a> - the deal that brought an end to 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles - opened up further possibilities.</p><p>McIlroy told me: \"That momentum that we all had was there at that period of time and in conjunction with the R&amp;A looking at Royal Portrush to potentially host the Open Championship again.</p><p>\"And then for it to go there, I think it's [down to] Irish golf and the players that have come through and how well that we've done.</p><p>\"But I also think it's a great representation of how far Northern Ireland has come in the last 30 or 40 years.</p><p>\"Because in the 70s and the 80s and the 90s, no one would have dreamed of hosting an Open Championship in Northern Ireland in those times.\"</p><p>Harrington agreed. \"Once it went there, we knew it would be a success,\" said the 53-year-old Dubliner.</p><p>\"We'd played a lot of amateur golf up there.

He and Nakisa Bidarian (who was once the UFC’s chief strategy and chief financial officer) met in 2019 when Bidarian began planning the 2020 exhibition between Mike Tyson and Roy Jones for Triller. Paul had only one fight on his resume at the time – a victory over social media personality Ali Eson Gib. But Bidarian signed him for the primary support bout beneath Tyson-Jones, and Jake knocked out former NBA basketball player Nate Robinson in the second round. The following year, he and Bidarian founded MVP.</p><p>Bidarian has a reputation for being hard-working, abrasive and smart. One person who has worked with him says, “Nakisa always thinks he’s the smartest person in the room, and very often that’s true. But he has the personality of a porcupine and can be difficult to deal with.”</p><p>That said; another person who has worked with Bidarian opines, “Nakisa is a hard negotiator but he’s always professional. He thinks creatively outside the box. And once he makes a deal, he lives up to it. He doesn’t look at a contract as the starting point for a new round of negotiations, which distinguishes him from a lot of people in boxing.”</p><p>MVP calls itself a managerial company. But like Al Haymon’s Premier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Boxing</a> Champions (another “managerial” company), it functions as a promoter. In recent years, MVP has promoted numerous small fight cards on DAZN. But its greatest success has come with Jake Paul’s fights. Now it’s trying to build on Paul’s social media presence and ring exploits to establish a promotional company that isn’t reliant on Jake fighting to turn a profit.</p><p>Paul’s ring career has blurred the line between social media influencers and traditional boxers. After knocking out Gib and Robinson, he won four more fights against a string of aging former MMA combatants before losing a decision to Tommy Fury. That was followed by five more wins, the most notable of which was an eight-round decision over 58-year-old Mike Tyson last November. Two weeks ago, he decisioned an unmotivated, out-of-shape, long-past-his-prime Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.</p><p>Paul has the ring skills of a club fighter. That merits respect. But now that the novelty of his fighting has worn off, he needs a dance partner to attract a large audience willing to pay big money to watch him fight. Tyson-Paul fit that profile to perfection. The fight was marred by a lack of serious PED testing and questionable medical-clearance standards for Tyson. But it drew 72,300 fans to AT&amp;T Stadium in Texas. The live gate surpassed $18m, making it the largest on-site gate ever in the United States for a fight card held outside of Las Vegas.</p><figure id=\"35545dca-4b52-4bbd-83f7-9203448d0f43\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Katie Taylor, right, embraces Amanda Serrano after Friday’s fight.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3655a5f77154bc796e12114a0a7b193850b31cf7/0_0_3210_2140/master/3210.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Katie Taylor, right, embraces Amanda Serrano after Friday’s fight.</span> Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images for Netflix</figcaption></figure><p>It was also the first live professional sports event ever on Netflix and the most-streamed sports event of all time. More than 60m households around the world watched it. That made Taylor-Serrano II (which was on the undercard of Tyson-Paul) the most-watched women’s sporting event in US history. Building on that success, Netflix purchased rights to stream Taylor-Serrano III as well as the upcoming 13 September Saudi-backed encounter between Canelo Álvarez and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/terence-crawford\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Terence Crawford</a>.</p><p>Paul has mastered the art of making money through social media. “We’ve been fortunate to have Jake as the head of our spear,” Bidarian acknowledges. “Social media is the most important currency in the world today because the vast majority of Gen Z and younger get their news, get their content, get their updates from social media.”</p><figure id=\"29a826af-0e5c-4ce2-b2ca-bd219d081d33\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:12,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘We created history’: Katie Taylor savors long-sought closure in Serrano trilogy&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;29a826af-0e5c-4ce2-b2ca-bd219d081d33&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/12/katie-taylor-amanda-serrano-trilogy-quotes-msg-boxing&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure><p>But once Paul stops boxing, MVP’s biggest money-making vehicle will be gone. Jake simply showing up for someone else’s fight that he’s promoting won’t create much wealth.</p><p>“They’re trying to develop other stars to fill the void,” says a manager who has done business with MVP. “But most of their young fighters aren’t very good. Other than Amanda Serrano, they haven’t signed a fighter who can generate big money. And Amanda has to be paired with someone like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/katie-taylor\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Katie Taylor</a> to sell.”</p><p>Bidarian is believed to be trying to raise capital from outside sources to expand MVP. Meanwhile, the company is working to establish a reputation as the place for elite women boxers to be and build what Bidarian calls “a cohesive unfragmented women’s boxing program”.

Here the trilogy came about because, even though Taylor emerged victorious on the judges’ scorecards in Taylor-Serrano I and II, they were exceptionally good fights. And many knowledgeable observers thought that Serrano deserved the decision in one or both of them.</p><p>Taylor-Serrano I was a watershed moment for women’s boxing. Promoted by Eddie Hearn, it was contested at Madison Square Garden on 30 April 2022, before a sellout crowd of 19,187 and engendered a live gate of $1,450,180. The atmosphere was electric. The action was heated. Taylor won a 97-93, 96-93, 94-96 verdict.</p><p>Taylor-Serrano II (on the undercard of Tyson-Paul) was just as enthralling. Once again, Taylor prevailed; this time by a slender 95-94, 95-94, 95-94 margin.</p><p>On both occasions, Serrano was remarkably gracious in defeat and accepted her loss without public complaint. But her resentment showed at the 9 April kick-off press conference for her third encounter with Taylor.</p><p>Not one to shy away from hype, host Ariel Helwani began the press conference by calling it “one of the most important press conferences in combat sports history”. Eventually the fighters had their say.</p><p>Serrano called Taylor a great champion and said she respected her in and out of the ring. Katie responded, “There’s no animosity on my side. I’m just here to fight.”</p><p>But things got testy when Serrano said that she’d wanted 12 three-minute rounds for their upcoming fight rather than the 10 two-minute rounds that are traditional for women’s championship bouts and claimed that Taylor had reneged on a promise to accept that format. Taylor countered that she’d declined the request because the WBC wouldn’t sanction the fight on those terms and added, “The challenger shouldn’t be dictating the terms of the fight. Amanda’s not in a position to dictate and Amanda’s not in a position to change the format of women’s boxing.”</p><p>That pushed Serrano’s buttons and she turned to the judging of the first two fights, declaring, “The world has eyes. They saw what they saw. It sucks that three judges see something completely different. But millions of people saw it another way.”</p><p>“I’m not interested in what Amanda says about the fight,” Taylor countered. “I’m only interested in what the judges say about the fight. I am 2-and-0 here. I was the deserved winner. Here we are again, having a silly conversation because you’re trying to create a narrative that you were robbed in that fight. That’s not OK, Amanda.”</p><p>“A lot of times I let those comments go,” Taylor said afterward. “But enough is enough of all the silly comments and the complaints over the decision and stuff. I’m 2-and-0 against her. She actually feels like she won that fight, which is not correct. She wants to walk to the ring second. She wants to be announced second. It’s absolutely ridiculous. After I beat her a third time, I don’t want any more complaints.”</p><p>Fight week offered the usual mix of media workouts, photo ops and other promotional activities. Serrano gave the impression of enjoying it. Taylor is on the shy side and would rather train and fight than talk.</p><figure id=\"260f6007-7e43-49d2-a9ad-df74f920cc63\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-4\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Katie Taylor celebrates with her title belts in her dressing room after Friday’s win.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf97001641832f4ca5649feecba6c7967f78eb4/0_0_5000_3571/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"317.81899999999996\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Katie Taylor celebrates with her title belts in her dressing room after Friday’s win.</span> Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images for Netflix</figcaption></figure><p>MVP announced that the event would “break the official Guinness World Records<strong> </strong>title<strong> </strong>for the most world championship belts ever contested on a single fight card, male or female, with 17 world titles on the line across five bouts”. But while fighters and networks care about the belts, most fight fans don’t. Championships were devalued in boxing long ago. And that’s particularly true of women’s boxing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ariel Helwani upped the ante at the final pre-fight press conference, calling the event “the greatest fight card of all time”.</p><p>Some of the undercard bouts that preceded Taylor-Serrano III were competitive and spirited. Others weren’t. Of particular note, Shadasia Green won a 96-93, 95-94, 93-96 split-decision over Savannah Marshall in an action fight that saw both women dig deep and could have gone either way on the judges’ scorecards.</p><figure id=\"d2f0d340-afe5-4ae3-bdfb-e6898bd3e3b1\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:35,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Taylor outpoints Serrano to cap classic trilogy on historic all-women’s card&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d2f0d340-afe5-4ae3-bdfb-e6898bd3e3b1&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/12/katie-taylor-amanda-serrano-trilogy-fight-report&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure><p>Finally it was time for the main event.</p><p>Taylor-Serrano III was for all four of Taylor’s 140lb belts. But as a concession to Serrano, there was a 136lb contract weight.</p><p>The high stakes and enthusiastic crowd (which leaned toward Serrano) gave the bout high drama. But the action was far more muted than in their first two encounters. This time around, Taylor put on a defensive boxing clinic.</p><p>The first three rounds were tactically fought with both women probing for openings and finding little to exploit. A judge could have scored them either way. Taylor’s game plan was clear. She had no intention of engaging in firefight exchanges. She would move, box and pick up points when and where she could. She fought a smart, measured, disciplined fight with side-to-side movement that exposed Serrano’s limitations as a boxer. And Amanda had no Plan B to break through Katie’s defensive shield. Serrano clearly won round six. But other than that, her stalking was largely ineffective aggression.</p><p>Two of the judges scored the fight 97-93 for Taylor, which was on the mark. The third tally (95-95) was bad judging.</p><p>“The whole game plan,” Taylor said afterward, “was to not let her feet set. I knew I was capable of a performance like that in the other two fights as well. But the two fights previously ended up as complete wars, and I came out of the ring battered and bruised and I’m thinking, ‘Why am I just standing there, fighting?’”</p><p>Putting that comment in perspective; Serrano landed 173 punches to Taylor’s 147 in their first encounter. In Taylor-Serrano III, those numbers increased to 324 to 217 in Amanda’s favor. This time around, each fighter landed a meager 70 punches.</p><p>Both women were gracious in the aftermath of the fight.</p><p>“I’m so grateful for Amanda Serrano,” Taylor said. “What an amazing champion. And we created history together three times. My name will be embedded with hers forever. I’m very very happy about that.”</p><p>Serrano responded in kind, saying, “Thank you Katie Taylor for an incredible three fights and 30 rounds. It has truly been an honor to face you.”</p><p>As for the future; Taylor’s voice is starting to sound softer and a bit less crisp and clear than it once did. Serrano is showing the wear and tear of 52 professional fights. Each woman has earned life-changing money. Their health shouldn’t be trifled with. It would be nice if they both retired now.</p><ul>\n <li>\n  <p>Thomas Hauser’s email address is <a href=\"mailto:thomashauserwriter@gmail.com\" data-link-name=\"in body link | mailto:thomashauserwriter@gmail.com\">thomashauserwriter@gmail.com</a>.

We further reject attempts to mischaracterize the committee's views or divide our membership,\" the executive committee said in the statement obtained by ESPN's Adam Schefter on Sunday.</p><p>\"We have established a deliberate process to carefully assess the issues that have been raised and will not engage in a rush to judgement. We believe in and remain committed to working with our Executive Director and other members of NFLPA staff and player leadership who have a shared mission to advance the best interests of players. As we approach the 2025 season, we look forward to continuing our important work together and ensuring the strength and unity of our association.\"</p><p>ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr. and Kalyn Kahler reported last week that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story?_slug_=nflpa-head-works-firm-approved-invest-nfl&amp;id=45705432\" target=\"_blank\">Howell is working as a paid, part-time consultant for the Carlyle Group</a>, one of a select group of league-approved private equity firms now seeking minority ownership in NFL franchises. A source with knowledge of the situation told ESPN that a union lawyer asked Howell to consider resigning from the private equity firm to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest if it ends up taking an ownership stake in an NFL franchise, but Howell declined to step away from Carlyle.</p><p>However, a source familiar with the matter told ESPN that Howell recalls only that concerns were raised by \"a union employee,\" and he said he would \"do his due diligence\" before making a decision.</p><p>Van Natta and Kahler also reported, via sources, on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story?_slug_=nflpa-nfl-agreed-keep-collusion-findings-secret&amp;id=45703132\" target=\"_blank\">the unusual confidentiality agreement that hid the details of a Jan. 14 arbitration decision from players</a>, including a finding that league executives had urged team owners to reduce guaranteed player compensation.</p><p>Arbitrator Christopher Droney ruled that there wasn't sufficient evidence of collusion by owners in contract negotiations with quarterbacks after the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"539babc5-e5fb-753b-8ae1-c15032a91ef4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns</a> gave <a data-player-guid=\"b6ec8e9e-3d85-a1de-9d0a-5a51621a9c20\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson</a> a record $230 million fully guaranteed deal in 2022. Though Droney did not award any damages and dismissed the NFLPA's demand in its entirety, he found that the NFLPA showed \"by a clear preponderance of the evidence that concerted action was contemplated and invited\" by the NFL office at the annual league meeting that March.</p><p>ESPN reported that Howell briefed the players on the decision but did not detail the findings or provide copies. The confidentiality agreement kept the details of Droney's finding from the players until the \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" podcast published the full arbiter's report late last month.</p><p>Last Tuesday, the NFLPA, led by Howell, decided to seek an appeal of the ruling, a senior union source told ESPN's Van Natta and Kahler.</p><p>\"The appeal is a reflection of our obligation to enforce the CBA and our commitment to protecting our players' interests,\" the source said. \"We'll do what's best for players, and we'll exhaust our options in doing so.\"</p><p>Sources told ESPN's Van Natta and Kahler last week that the union last month hired Ronald C. Machen of law firm Wilmer Hale to work with a special committee of players to review Howell's activities as the executive director.</p><p>Howell was elected as the NFLPA's executive director in 2023, replacing DeMaurice Smith, who had served in the role since 2009.</p>\n</div></div>"

He is the first Italian player to win a Wimbledon singles title.</p><p>Sinner and Alcaraz have combined to win the past seven Grand Slam trophies, and nine of the past 12. Fittingly, this marked the first time the same two men faced off in the title matches at the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year since <a data-player-guid=\"6bf3e1d1-c102-93e9-a4e9-32ba6e82f887\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=425\">Roger Federer</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"f091e8bf-f001-4687-0448-4b009dd966e8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=261\">Rafael Nadal</a> did it in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It hadn't happened for more than a half-century before that trilogy.</p><p>Alcaraz, a 22-year-old from Spain, had won the past five head-to-head matches between the pair, most recently across five sets and nearly 5½ hours at Roland Garros on June 8 to improve to 5-0 in major finals.</p><p>\"I had a very tough loss in Paris. But at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how you win or you lose the important tournaments. You just have to understand what you did wrong. Trying to work on that -- that's exactly what we did. We tried to accept the loss and then just kept working,\" Sinner said during Sunday's on-court ceremony. \"And this is, for sure, why I'm holding this trophy here.\"</p><p>Sinner led 4-2 early in the match, but Alcaraz reeled off four straight games to snag the first set. That spurt included a 140 mph ace that sprayed the air with a cloud of white chalk dust and a set-capping, flick-of-a-backhand winner at an impossible angle after barely getting his racket on the ball.</p><p>As fans rose and roared, Alcaraz pointed to his ear and spun around, then pumped his right fist overhead.</p><p>Sinner was undaunted, quickly breaking to lead the second set and holding serve the rest of the way, despite being interrupted by a fan in the stands popping open a champagne bottle as Sinner was getting ready to serve out the game at 2-1 up. The cork landed at Sinner's feet.</p><p>\"No, only here at Wimbledon,\" a smiling Sinner said when asked if that had ever happened to him before. \"But that's exactly why we love playing here.\"</p><p>Sinner's return game was exceptional, even as Alcaraz served aggressively, which did lead to 15 aces -- but also to a 53% first-serve percentage and seven double faults.</p><p>While serving at 4-3, 15-40 in the fourth set, Sinner faced two break points. But he calmly took the next four points to win that game, then soon was serving out the match victory after a chorus of \"Car-los! Car-los!\" rang out from spectators.</p><p>\"The things that went his way in Paris,\" Sinner said, \"went my way this time.\"</p><p>When it ended, he put both hands on his white hat. After embracing Alcaraz, Sinner crouched with his head bowed, then pounded his right palm on the grass.</p><p>\"Thank you for the player you are,\" Sinner told Alcaraz. \"It's so difficult to play against you.\"</p><p>The 532-day span between Sinner's 2024 Australian Open victory and his Wimbledon win is the second shortest by any man to win his first four majors, after Federer (434 days from 2003 Wimbledon to 2004 US Open). In between, Sinner won his first US Open -- shortly after the world learned about a doping case that eventually led to a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story?_slug_=no-1-jannik-sinner-gets-3-month-ban-doping-settlement&amp;id=43854993\" target=\"_blank\">three-month ban</a> -- and repeated as champion in Melbourne.</p><p>With Prince William and Princess Kate in the Royal Box, along with King Felipe VI of Spain, Alcaraz stepped into the sunlight bathing Centre Court as the holder of a career-best 24-match unbeaten run. He had won 20 consecutive matches at the All England Club, including victories against <a data-player-guid=\"4a27bb1c-2422-55c3-208b-9e9d8c1f30af\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=296\">Novak Djokovic</a> in the 2023 and 2024 finals, and his .921 win percentage on grass (35-3) in his tour-level career was the best by any man in the Open era.</p><p>\"It's difficult to lose,\" Alcaraz said. \"It's always difficult to lose.\"</p><p>The last man to beat Alcaraz at Wimbledon? Sinner, in the fourth round in 2022.</p><p>\"I'm just really, really happy about having this rivalry with him,\" Alcaraz said about Sinner. \"It's great for us, and it is great for tennis.\"</p><p>Wearing the same tape job and white arm sleeve to protect his right elbow that he has been using since falling in the fourth round, Sinner never showed any issues, just as he hadn't while eliminating 24-time major champion Djokovic in the semifinals.</p><p>\"Today was important not just because it was a Grand Slam final, not just because it was Wimbledon, and not just because Carlos had won the last five matches against him,\" said Darren Cahill, an ESPN analyst and one of Sinner's two coaches, who had planned to leave the team at the end of 2025 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/45734850/jannik-sinner-wimbledon-title-wins-bet-darren-cahill-keep-coaching-him\" target=\"_blank\">but now might stick around</a>. \"He needed that win today. So he knew the importance of closing this one out when he had the opportunities.\"</p><p><em>ESPN Research and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</div></div>"

People are definitely tense around you. It is a tough place. The consequences of failure were so huge. If I didn’t win that day, I still wouldn’t be over it. How much it meant, where it was, all that stuff.</p><p>“Oakmont helped me, 100%. I went out in the final round there not to lose the tournament. At Portrush, I went out to win. I said to Neil [Manchip, Lowry’s coach] that Sunday morning: ‘If I can make five birdies today, nobody can beat me.’ Even if I made five bogeys as well and shot level, nobody was beating me in that weather. That was the mindset. At Oakmont, I went out to make pars and let it all slip.”</p><p>Lowry felt at home on the Dunluce Links and he was roared on towards victory by a mix of total strangers and those closest to him. “Until I played my tee shot on the 17th on Sunday, I didn’t allow myself to think, ‘This is it.’ I hit that one and realised I could kick it in from there, I had a six-shot lead.</p><p>“I was looking out for people. I saw a lot of friends at the top of the 18th grandstand. Turning the dog-leg corner at the last, I could see my daughter… she was only two-and-a-half at the time and had this bright yellow jacket on. I could see that right behind the flag, in the tunnel at the back of the 18th green. A wave of emotion came over me.

Rory [McIlroy] was the same. We played a lot, played really well in games against each other, then we would come on tour and the lack of crowds and energy affected us.

Yet it is a truism that one so talented should really have more than one major to their name. “It definitely helps that I have one because if I didn’t by now, it would be doing my head in,” he says.</p><p>“I have to stress this is not me lacking drive, but if I was to pack it in today I would be pretty happy with what I have. That doesn’t at all mean I don’t want more.”</p></div></div>"

He reclassified to the 2025 class, so is one of the younger players in the draft, not turning 18 until December, a big plus in analytic draft models. He's a clear shortstop with a good hit tool and contact ability, with his future power outcome the biggest question mark as he turns pro.</p><p><strong>Why the Nationals took him here: </strong>There was a lot of intrigue about which direction the Nationals would go in a draft without a slam-dunk No. 1 pick -- and Washington surprised everyone with this pick. Willits was one of the top players in this draft, but he was behind Ethan Holliday and Kade Anderson as options to go No. 1 overall. He's one of the youngest prospects in this draft -- and that's a very good thing for his potential, considering <a data-player-guid=\"62868d49-9586-ee9d-19b4-66fb91f26733\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32653/carlos-correa\">Carlos Correa</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"94848feb-9141-9679-d2cd-ae79905d969c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32129/francisco-lindor\">Francisco Lindor</a> were also both 17-year-old shortstops on draft night.</p><p>There's also a chance that taking Willits here could come with some bonus-money savings that sets Washington up for some splashy picks in the coming rounds. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong>Kevin McGonigle, with more speed and defense</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>2. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"053868c7-8bff-5edb-3cb6-f5490f33ef99\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a>: Tyler Bremner, RHP, UC Santa Barbara</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 18</p><p><strong>Who is Bremner?</strong> Bremner entered the season alongside Jamie Arnold as the top collegiate pitcher after a strong sophomore season and a summer pitching for USA Baseball's collegiate national team, but he scuffled early on with inconsistent stuff and results. He finished stronger, including a string of double-digit-strikeout games, and he threw strikes, walking just 19 batters in 77⅓ innings with 111 strikeouts. He sits 94-96, touching 98, but his plus changeup might be his best offering while his slider was hit hard and backed up compared to 2024.</p><p><strong>Why the Angels took him here: </strong>Two picks into this draft and teams are already sending a clear message, as Bremner is the second straight curveball: The talent at the top doesn't match that of recent drafts, so Washington and L.A. are likely saving money with their picks with underslot deals. Bremner does fit the Angels' model of drafting college prospects who can move quickly, but ESPN's Kiley McDaniel had Bremner ranked just 18th on his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45688041/2025-mlb-draft-rankings-top-250-prospects-final-kade-anderson-liam-doyle-ethan-holliday\">most recent draft board</a>. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> <a data-player-guid=\"a6551440-b17b-3fc1-60b7-5dbce0a5bda7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32640/michael-wacha\">Michael Wacha</a> with more upside</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/sea.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>3. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"56d60582-088f-6848-5180-1fb04440cf87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a>: Kade Anderson, LHP, LSU</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 1</p><p><strong>Who is Anderson? </strong>Winner of the Most Outstanding Player award at the College World Series in leading LSU to the title after allowing one run in 17 innings, including a 1-0 shutout in the finals, Anderson topped Division I with 180 strikeouts, finishing 12-1 with a 3.18 ERA. Anderson had Tommy John surgery in high school, missing his senior season, but he's a polished lefty with a five-pitch repertoire if you include both his fastballs.

Like his brother, Ethan is a left-handed hitter, although he's much bigger (6-foot-4 compared to 6-foot) and built more like their dad, thus projects to have similar 30-homer power. He lacks the range to stay at shortstop but should be an above-average defender at third base. There are some concerns about his performance last summer on the showcase circuit and weak competition this spring in high school, but scouts love the swing and power ceiling.</p><p><strong>Why the Rockies took him here:</strong> There was plenty of talk about Holliday being a possibility for the No. 1 pick, so the Rockies have to be happy about getting the player who might have the best chance of developing into a true major league star. His best-case scenario is reaching the majors as a power-hitting, good-fielding third baseman who turns into the Rockies' first franchise player since they traded away a power-hitting, good-fielding third baseman in Nolan Arenado. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> Left-handed-hitting version of <a data-player-guid=\"2eb5e599-5517-7cf4-8f12-de7e6bd899f3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33857/matt-chapman\">Matt Chapman</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"1a1ec65f-a81f-8ce9-9f38-7275b93a2474\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez\">Eugenio Suarez</a></p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/stl.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>5. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c781e7c6-2c5b-beaf-55b8-999c76f76661\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-cardinals\">St. Louis Cardinals</a>: Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 6</p><p><strong>Who is Doyle? </strong>One of the three highly rated lefty collegiate pitchers, Doyle went 10-4 with a 3.20 ERA for the Vols, striking out 164 in 95⅔ innings, finishing second in Division I in strikeouts and first in K's per nine. After sitting in the low 90s as a sophomore, Doyle sat in the mid-90s, peaking at 100 mph and often just blowing his heater by college hitters.

The question here is if the rest of Doyle's arsenal and delivery can be strong enough to keep him in the rotation. Best case, St. Louis just added a strong part of its rotation for years to come -- but a potential closer or top setup option isn't a bad fallback plan either. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp:</strong> <a data-player-guid=\"fe783a66-6c4d-3706-afae-cc30e5651f97\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4307825/spencer-strider\">Spencer Strider</a>, if he was left-handed but had real questions about his command/stamina/delivery</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/pit.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>6. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>: Seth Hernandez, RHP, Corona HS (Calif.)</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 4</p><p><strong>Who is Hernandez? </strong>No high school right-hander has ever gone first overall, but Hernandez put himself in that discussion as the clear top prep arm in the draft. With a projectable 6-4 frame, he followed up a strong summer in 2024 with a dominant high school season, touching triple digits but also showcasing a plus-plus changeup and an above-average 12-to-6 curveball with a high spin rate. He was athletic enough to play the field when he didn't pitch, which might help him overcome the risky history of first-round high school pitchers.</p><p><strong>Why the Pirates took him here: </strong>The Pirates have Paul Skenes in the majors and Bubba Chandler, perhaps the top pitching prospect in the minors, in Triple-A, and now they've added Hernandez, who might have the most upside of any pitcher in the draft, with a fastball up to 100 mph and plus-plus changeup. He's a good athlete (he was a second-round prospect as a hitter), which is another plus.

In Arquette, they get one of the top hitters in college baseball and a prospect who should be able to supply some power while climbing quickly to the majors.

The big question, though, is if his free-swinging style will work at the next level. <em>-- Mullen</em></p><p><strong>MLB player comp: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"948a03e2-0df4-d2e2-c11d-dbcd7d7b57b8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner\">Trea Turner</a> with a dash of Jett Williams and a dusting of <a data-player-guid=\"9a98f8e9-c371-32a1-ac9d-040b12582b8d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42547/anthony-volpe\">Anthony Volpe</a></p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/cws.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>10. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8f4800c6-3c05-b3d5-8186-9750cd72a3c2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a>: Billy Carlson, SS, Corona HS (Calif.)</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking: </strong>No. 8</p><p><strong>Who is Carlson? </strong>Seth Hernandez's high school teammate, Carlson is how you draw up a prep shortstop: above-average-to-plus bat speed and raw power, an 80-grade arm (up to 97 mph as a pitcher), range in the field and game performance.

Southisene certainly has some development ahead of him and maybe even ends up in the outfield, but he immediately becomes perhaps the top position player prospect in Atlanta's system. <em>-- Schoenfield</em></p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/kc.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2>23. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"11a5df00-0945-35a5-66fe-a3a107975558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-royals\">Kansas City Royals</a>: Sean Gamble, 2B, IMG Academy HS (Fla.)</h2><p><strong>Draft ranking:</strong> No. 35</p><p><strong>Who is Gamble? </strong>An Iowa native, Gamble played all four of his high school years at IMG Academy, where he has performed well against good competition on the showcase circuit, with plus bat speed from the left side and plus speed that might eventually see him land in center field, where he has seen action.

If the Royals think that he can stick in center field, the upside of this pick suddenly becomes a lot higher. Offensively, Gamble has a smooth left-handed swing and can drive the ball to all fields.

On that tour half a dozen players were called up primarily because of their geographical proximity rather than, in certain cases, on pure playing merit.</p><p>In this case, Sutherland was a Lion in South Africa four years ago where he played in six matches including two of the Tests, Graham was a strong candidate to make the squad in the first place, and Ashman has won the nod over Wales’s Dewi Lake.</p><p>Ashman, who plays his club rugby for Edinburgh, has won 28 caps to date and made his Scotland debut in November 2021 against Australia. Graham has played for Scotland for seven years and scored 31 tries in 47 Tests, although he was sent off at the weekend for collecting two yellow cards against Fiji.</p><p>No ban has been forthcoming, however, so the winger is free to join up with the Lions. The number of extra bodies being bussed in, nevertheless, again brings into question the logistics of modern day Lions tours with the management once more required to cobble together a team for midweek games sandwiched in between Test matches.</p></div></div>"

But after taking the first set, he was outplayed by Sinner, who is the first Italian to win the title.</p><p>It's the first time Sinner has beaten Alcaraz in their past six meetings, cutting the deficit in their head-to-head battles to 8-5. The pair are now 1-1 in Slam finals against each other and have separated themselves from the pack.</p><p>We break down what makes their rivalry special.</p><hr><h2>They bring out the best in each other</h2><p>Like all great rivalries, these two seem to force each other to new levels. At times, when they're going toe-to-toe from the baseline, it's like watching Pong, the vintage computer game, where the ball speeds up at every turn.</p><p>The shot-making is incredible, as Sinner showed with a between-the-legs half-volley in the final on Sunday, or as Alcaraz demonstrated with an outrageous stretch before hitting a sliced backhand pass. Three of their four Grand Slam battles have gone the distance, and their Roland Garros final this year is already being talked up as one of the all-time great matches.</p><p>Each says the other has made him a better player, and that the other inspires him to work harder, knowing that if they don't, the other one will be.</p><p>\"I'm really happy to be able to build a great relationship off the court but also a great rivalry on the court that makes me improve every day,\" Alcaraz said on Sunday.</p><h2>They have won the past seven majors between them</h2><p>When Djokovic, Federer and <a data-player-guid=\"f091e8bf-f001-4687-0448-4b009dd966e8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=261\">Rafael Nadal</a> were dominating the game, they monopolized the majors, too. From the start of 2004 to the end of Roland Garros, the Big Three won 65 of the 77 Grand Slams to be played -- a phenomenal era.</p><p>Alcaraz and Sinner are in their infancy, by comparison, but they have now won the past seven majors between them: Sinner winning four and Alcaraz winning three. Things can change quickly in tennis, and the youngsters like <a data-player-guid=\"9a28fc19-1dff-35eb-88f2-106e324b1333\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=11745\">Joao Fonseca</a> may challenge them in the years to come. But right now, it's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/45473582/2025-french-open-title-winner-men-alcaraz-sinner-big-2\">hard to see anyone else winning any of the four Slams</a>, if this duo stays fit.</p><h2>Their contrasting styles make for dramatic battles</h2><p>We're not quite talking about John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl, the ultimate contrast in styles or personalities; Sinner and Alcaraz genuinely like each other and respect each other, on and off the court. But they are also different enough, in terms of the way they play, to ensure that whenever they meet, drama is almost guaranteed.</p><p>Both are incredible athletes. Alcaraz has the flair -- the touch, the groundstrokes, the charisma -- while Sinner has the power, the poise, the unflappable nature. One rises, the other responds; when Alcaraz rushes the net, Sinner passes; when Sinner moves back, Alcaraz uses the drop shot. Neither gives an inch, each always believes they can dig themselves out of a hole, and the smile of Alcaraz is matched by the steel in the eyes of Sinner.</p><h2>Sinner's win is good for the rivalry</h2><p>Where does their rivalry sit in terms of tennis history? Well, Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert's record of 80 matches against each other -- an incredible 60 in finals -- will probably never be beaten, but the way these two are dominating the sport, equally adept on every surface, suggests they are likely to be playing each other for the biggest titles for many years to come.</p><p>A rivalry is only a rivalry if both players keep winning, and so in that sense, Sinner's victory was important, ending a run of five straight losses to Alcaraz, who now leads 8-5. Almost every time they play each other it seems to be a classic, and if they get anywhere near the likes of <a data-player-guid=\"4a27bb1c-2422-55c3-208b-9e9d8c1f30af\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=296\">Novak Djokovic</a> and Rafael Nadal (60); Djokovic and <a data-player-guid=\"6bf3e1d1-c102-93e9-a4e9-32ba6e82f887\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=425\">Roger Federer</a> (50) and Federer and Nadal (40), then we're in for a treat.</p>\n</div></div>"

Swiatek didn't seem concerned.</p><p>\"If I would lose here earlier, maybe I would be able to play two more weeks on grass and then be a better grass player,\" Swiatek said matter-of-factly. \"But if I had to choose, I love playing on clay, so I'm not going to give up that ever.\"</p><p>Swiatek then opted to skip all of the grass tournaments to focus on rest and recovery after the long clay season. She lost in the third round at the All England Club.</p><p>But this year, Swiatek did lose earlier at her beloved Roland Garros. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/45457723/aryna-sabalenka-ends-iga-swiatek-26-match-french-open-streak\">She was upset by world No. 1</a> <a data-player-guid=\"c91d133a-526a-ea8d-654c-7ef6915ad63b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3038\">Aryna Sabalenka</a> in the semifinals, ending her dream for a fourth consecutive title at the major. Swiatek -- albeit involuntarily -- did have more time to prepare for the grass.</p><p>Her words from a year ago turned out to be right: The additional weeks on the surface helped her become a better grass player. But even she likely couldn't have predicted just how good, and just how dominant, she would become. Or how she would thrive without the overwhelming attention and pressure that she faced at the French Open.</p><p>And she certainly couldn't have guessed that she would be the 2025 Wimbledon champion. But that's exactly what happened Saturday, following an impressive fortnight and a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/45724291/iga-swiatek-dominates-amanda-anisimova-win-wimbledon-2025-title\">staggering 6-0, 6-0 victory</a> in the final to win in less than an hour over No. 13 seed <a data-player-guid=\"223cc423-bf69-2077-800f-c38d0d1e79f7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3221\">Amanda Anisimova</a>.</p><p>\"Honestly, I didn't even dream [of this] because for me it was just way too far,\" Swiatek said on court just moments after securing the title. \"I feel like I'm already an experienced player, after winning Slams before, but I never really expected this one.\"</p><p>Swiatek, 24, has now won six Grand Slam titles, and becomes just the eighth woman, and the only active WTA player, to win major titles on all three surfaces. She's also the youngest to do so since <a data-player-guid=\"1ce0271d-9cba-c2c7-1c29-393ef26c6df6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=187\">Martina Hingis</a> in 2003. She's as surprised as anyone that she was able to do it.</p><hr><p><b>IRONICALLY, SWIATEK'S HIGH POINT</b> as a junior was at Wimbledon, when she won the girls' singles title in 2018.</p><p>It was her only Slam title as a junior, and she had been all but untouchable during her run. But <a href=\"https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2018-07-14/2018-07-14_swiatek_wins_girls_singles_title.html\">even the brief recap</a> on the Wimbledon website after her 6-4, 6-2 triumph in the final stated that \"clay remains her preferred surface.\"</p><p>Sure enough, the clay was where Swiatek initially found the most success as a professional. She reached her first WTA final on the surface and then, as an unseeded 19-year-old and a relative unknown, stunned the tennis world <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/30084335/breakthrough-2020-french-open-title-just-beginning-iga-swiatek\">by claiming the title at the pandemic-delayed 2020 French Open</a>.</p><p>While many were unfamiliar with Swiatek and her game before the tournament, she made quite the impression during her run.</p><p>\"The way she's playing right now, it would be hard to imagine she wouldn't win half a dozen majors,\" seven-time major champion and tennis analyst John McEnroe said after her victory. \"It's incredible.\"</p><p>The clay remained her bread-and-butter, but she also emerged as a strong hard-court player as well. She won her first title on the surface in Adelaide, a 500-level event, just months after her breakthrough in Paris. She recorded a historic 37-match winning streak in the spring of 2022 -- which included the titles at Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart, Rome and the French Open -- and clinched the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in April of that year, following the unexpected retirement of <a data-player-guid=\"6103e730-3773-928b-e612-b3e6fad8ff84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2031\">Ashleigh Barty</a>. Her winning streak was stopped in the third round of Wimbledon, but she won the US Open by year's end.</p><p>Swiatek held the top ranking for 75 weeks. After failing to defend her US Open title in 2023, she fell to No. 2 briefly, and Sabalenka took No. 1, but she reclaimed it just eight weeks later. The 2024 season was looking to be equally dominant for Swiatek, as she won four of the year's first six 1000-level titles and then was victorious again at the French Open.</p><p>\"She's No. 1. I would say she's really good in every asset of the game,\" Sabalenka said after losing to her in the Italian Open final last year.</p><p>But after hoisting her fifth major trophy, and fourth at Roland Garros, Swiatek struggled, by her standards anyway. The clear favorite for the 2024 Olympics  (held at Roland Garros), Swiatek walked away with the bronze after being upset in the semifinals. She then fell in the quarterfinals at the US Open. She parted ways with her longtime coach Tomasz Wiktorowski and began working with Wim Fissette soon after. Swiatek received a one-month suspension in November <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/42660782/iga-swiatek-accepts-one-month-suspension-doping-case\">after testing positive for a banned substance</a>.</p><p>In that time -- a near eternity for a player of her caliber -- she hadn't won another title. All eyes were on her at the 2025 French Open to see if she could turn things around. When she didn't, her ranking fell to a stunning No. 8.</p><p>It seemed unlikely that Wimbledon and the grass would be much better, as she had never fared well on the surface or at the tournament.</p><p>Grass is the shortest portion of the annual tennis calendar, and for the three previous years, Swiatek had won the French Open, only about three weeks before the start of Wimbledon. That left a very short window to prepare for grass.</p><p>\"I think the toughest transition is [on] the grass,\" Chris Evert, the 18-time major champion and ESPN analyst, said ahead of Wimbledon. \"The clay you've got five weeks [of] tournaments [on] the red clay. You can really get used to playing on clay by the time the French Open comes around, but Wimbledon is really tough, especially for players who do well at the French.\"</p><p>Evert mentioned <a data-player-guid=\"ca44c2b0-9dea-ab40-2541-b50a4442ff8e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3626\">Coco Gauff</a> as a recent example. The 2025 French Open champion returned to play after a whirlwind media tour for just one warmup tournament in Berlin and lost in her opening match. She then was upset in the first round at Wimbledon.</p><p>In addition to the quick turnaround, clay and grass surfaces are radically different. Even some of the most seasoned veterans struggle in the transition between the two.</p><p>\"Those two surfaces, red clay and grass, are polar opposites, and you need to make a lot of adjustments,\" Evert added. \"The court is different. Your positioning is different. You've got to shorten your strokes. You've got to always be moving into the net if you can. There are just so many things different on the clay that you have to think of and make adjustments.\"</p><p>Prior to this year, Swiatek's best result at Wimbledon had been a quarterfinal appearance in 2023. In her limited grass tournament appearances during that time -- she played in just three main draws outside of Wimbledon since turning professional -- she reached just one semifinal, also in 2023 at Bad Homburg.</p><p>But one year, one tournament, even one match, can change everything. Swiatek had said she was no longer focused on points or her ranking following her French Open exit, and said she would be turning her attention to the grass almost immediately.</p><p>\"Hopefully we're going to have some decent kind of little preseason on grass, because it's always been pretty hard to have that, especially when I want to be a little bit home,\" Swiatek said last month. \"But I don't feel like I need to be home right now, so maybe I'll go somewhere in Europe and practice.\"</p><p>Swiatek returned to competition a little less than three weeks later at Bad Homburg. She advanced to her first-ever grass final behind wins over two-time major champion <a data-player-guid=\"812f6593-cca7-7378-7e10-ea24e932564c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=421\">Victoria Azarenka</a> in the round of 16 and with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over 2024 Wimbledon finalist <a data-player-guid=\"1cb6cc14-00ad-6c8b-301e-aa8adc243503\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2615\">Jasmine Paolini</a> in the semifinals. She ultimately lost to <a data-player-guid=\"63f9c1e5-14bd-003f-c269-31543931ad1d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2113\">Jessica Pegula</a> for the title, but arrived to the All England Club with momentum on her side and, as she told reporters the next day, \"a lot of confidence.\"</p><p>But there were far fewer expectations for Swiatek at Wimbledon than at the French Open, and Sabalenka was the overwhelming favorite to win. That all seemed to suit Swiatek.</p><p>While many of her top-ranked peers, including No. 2 Gauff and No. 3 Pegula, fell early in the upset-riddled opening rounds, Swiatek was largely in control and seemed to improve with every match. En route to the final, she dropped just one set (to American Caty McNally, whom she had won the junior French Open doubles title with in 2018) and was propelled by her strong serve, losing only six service games in her first six matches. She routed <a data-player-guid=\"4a64595c-074a-b6e6-1a41-299469b5e1ea\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2183\">Belinda Bencic</a>, 6-2, 6-0, in the semifinals on Thursday.</p><p>\"I just definitely felt like she was completely on fire,\" Bencic later said. \"I will, of course, watch the match again and see also with my team what I could have done differently, but maybe I would have had to play my absolutely best tennis of my life and risk every shot to beat her today the way she played.\"</p><blockquote><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pasta with strawberries 🍓<a href=\"https://twitter.com/iga_swiatek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@iga_swiatek</a>'s favourite meal is an interesting one 😂<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wimbledon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Wimbledon</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FJNdwRBE8x\">pic.twitter.com/FJNdwRBE8x</a></p>— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wimbledon/status/1941538774325899697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p>Along the way, Swiatek seemed to be having fun. She went viral for her pasta-and-strawberries dish and for her affinity for the Wimbledon towels. She was hilariously spotted throughout the tournament hoarding as many as she could after matches, even good-naturedly putting her finger over her lip to the camera as if to keep it a secret when she put one in her bag after her quarterfinal win.</p><p>On Saturday during the final, she had her most dominant performance yet. Swiatek broke Anisimova in the opening game, and there was little doubt the rest of the way. She won the first set in 25 minutes and held Anisimova to just nine points. It was just the third women's major final, and second in the Open era, to feature a 6-0, 6-0 score. It had only previously happened at Wimbledon in 1911.</p><p>When asked by ESPN's Mary Joe Fernandez after the match to explain what she had just achieved, Swiatek said she didn't think she could.</p><blockquote>— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wimbledon/status/1940824844917969368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p>\"I was really competing throughout the whole two weeks,\" Swiatek said. \"No matter what happened before the season, I just trusted the process and the things that my coach wanted me to do on grass. So it was all pretty simple what I wanted to do on the court.</p><p>\"I think I was serving great and I just leaned on that. Had a lot of confidence on every match and, and this happened. So it's all pretty surreal and crazy. I can't explain that, but I'm super happy and I'll enjoy the next days for sure.\"</p><p>Her 35 total games lost throughout the tournament were the fewest by any women's champion at Wimbledon since <a data-player-guid=\"dd77b4c8-665f-6d85-1dd5-339aaafa02a8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1426\">Martina Navratilova</a> in 1990.</p><hr><p><b>AFTER AN EMOTIONAL</b> hug with Anisimova at the net at the match's conclusion, Swiatek ran over to her box to celebrate with her team. Despite the score and the lopsided contest, Swiatek appeared to be in disbelief. When she was back on the court ahead of the trophy ceremony, she emphatically shook her head when it was placed in her hands as she stared back up at those in the box.</p><p>With the Wimbledon trophy, Swiatek is now just one major title behind <a data-player-guid=\"bb2deb63-4fce-9e10-80e8-e16590139fb3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=403\">Venus Williams</a> for the most among active players on the WTA Tour. She will now be back up to No. 3 in the latest rankings.</p><p>While she had never been much of a factor at Wimbledon before, Swiatek found a way to win her perhaps unlikeliest of major titles, at perhaps the unlikeliest time in her young career. She still wouldn't call herself a grass-court specialist Saturday and admitted she didn't know what to expect going into the final.</p><p>\"I kind of just wanted to enjoy the moment because with my previous [Wimbledon] results, I wasn't sure if I'm going to have another chance,\" Swiatek told Fernandez. \"I still felt like an underdog and I wanted to really just soak in every minute of being on Centre Court and appreciating already what I did at this tournament, but on the other hand, going for more and being brave.\"</p><p>She may have been under the radar at the tournament, and even slightly unsure of herself, but that won't happen again. Nor will she be discounted at any tournament in the near future. Throughout the fortnight, she left little doubt about her ability and her willingness to adapt and grow as a player, regardless of surface. In doing so, she solidified her status as an all-surface player and reclaimed her status among the game's best. Swiatek is now once again on top of the tennis world.</p><p>Just over five weeks ago, Swiatek left Roland Garros disappointed and dejected. She hadn't won the title. Questions about her future and her recent inability to win titles swirled.</p><p>But on Saturday, as she stood on Centre Court with the admiring eyes of more than 14,000 fans and Catherine, the Princess of Wales, on her, she wondered if it was one of the best things that could have happened to her career. What comes next for Swiatek no one knows, but on Saturday, all felt right for her.</p><p>\"I don't really care what's going to happen,\" Swiatek said about the rest of the season. \"It's hard to compare [this title] to the other Grand Slams, but yeah, I feel like I'm just going to enjoy it and enjoy the way I felt on the court over the past few weeks. There were a lot of people, especially back home, [who] kind of doubted me and not making it easy for me to do my job, and I mean, the expectations and everything.</p><p>\"So I hope I prove to everybody that they should just kind of leave me alone, let me do my work, let me focus on myself, and I'll have great performances as I did today.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

Half a century later, the upset is remembered almost as much for how it happened as for the result.</p><p>The momentous Centre Court match pitted the professorial Ashe, 32, and the brash 23-year-old lefty, Connors, who had just challenged Ashe in court. Connors filed a June 1975 lawsuit alleging that Ashe, former president of the Association of Tennis Professionals, defamed him in a letter to the ATP that criticized Connors for not playing on the US Davis Cup team.</p><p>On this day of the gentlemen's final 50 years later, three tennis figures reflect on how Ashe, who won three majors, knocked off Connors, who won eight. How Ashe ditched his trademark power game, dictated play and dominated Connors 6-1, 6-1, 5-7, 6-4. And how Ashe left a lasting legacy in a life that ended due to AIDS-related pneumonia at age 49.</p><p><i>The following are edited excerpts from interviews at Wimbledon this fortnight with Chris Eubanks, a current pro, ESPN commentator and a 2023 Wimbledon quarterfinalist; Richard Evans, a British journalist, author, tennis historian and Ashe's friend; and Stan Smith, who won the US Open in 1971 and Wimbledon in 1972 and was Ashe's Davis Cup teammate and friend.</i></p><p><b>Richard Evans:</b> It was just a privilege to be there because we were all stunned, not at Arthur Ashe winning -- although he wasn't the favorite against Jimmy Connors -- but how he won it. The most extraordinary Wimbledon final I've ever seen, and I've seen a few. It was really all about Arthur understanding how he had to play to beat Jimmy Connors, who at that time people thought was invincible.</p><p><b>Chris Eubanks:</b> Most times players go on court, they're going out there guns blazing, especially in a final. They want to play to their strengths. He took a totally different approach.</p><p><b>Stan Smith:</b> Jimmy had won '74 -- beaten Ken Rosewall in the final. He was flying high, I think as confident as he's ever been, so that made what took place even more remarkable.</p><p><b>Richard Evans:</b> Charlie Pasarell [Ashe's friend and fellow player]; Arthur; another player called Freddy McNair; and Donald Dell, who was Arthur's best friend and agent, went to the Playboy Club [the night] before the Wimbledon final. And they sat down and mapped out a plan, because they all agreed and knew that if Arthur went out there on Centre Court at Wimbledon ... with his usual free-flowing, hard-hitting style, he'd lose, because that's what Connors loved. Jimmy was a little guy [5-foot-10]. He couldn't generate power himself. He needed to feed off his opponent's power. So they said, \"OK, we won't give him any.\" And to our amazement, Arthur started the match, soft-balling him, drop-shotting him, lobbing him, pushing the ball over the net. And Connors had nothing to work with.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> You can think of it, and you can strategize, and you can dream about it working, but to actually go out and implement that strategy was pretty amazing. You have to have the ability to do that. A lot of players can think of that strategy but they can't apply it. He was able to with really good touch and feel, which is really not his game, and Jimmy was kind of taken aback.</p><p>I think he just kind of was totally flummoxed by what was going on. He was staying way back, ready for that big serve. Arthur was slicing the thing wide, and Jimmy was way back and to the side when he's returning that ball, so he gave the whole court to Arthur to hit to. I'm sure he thought he's going to switch or change his strategy. He probably is still shocked that it took place and the way it took place.</p><p><b>Evans:</b> The most extraordinary aspect of it was that you can imagine and take any sport, ask any champion star to play the most important match of their lives and completely change their style. Many would say it's impossible. And Arthur stuck to it. He even stuck to it when Connors came back and won the third set, where many people would have panicked and reverted to what was natural to them. He didn't. A push and a shove and a drop shot, and Jimmy fell apart all over again. It was the most brilliant tactical match -- or sporting moment, really -- that I've ever seen in my life.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> You really haven't seen anything quite like that -- a complete switch in style of play, not only strategy but style of play, for a guy who didn't play that way well. And I didn't see it again from Arthur in other matches he played. We played each other a few times, and I saw him play and he was on the tour, so it was kind of a one-off, which is pretty amazing.</p><p><b>Evans:</b> The whole crowd was bemused, but pleased, because Arthur was very much more popular than Jimmy, who had his fans, but they couldn't do anything for him. We [Arthur and I] spoke about it a lot over time. It was his great ambition as a tennis player; it was what he'd been brought up to believe was the pinnacle of the sport. It would have been a real shame if his career had ended without being able to say, \"I am Wimbledon champion.\" He deserved to be Wimbledon champion, and my god, he earned it.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> I think he was proud that he kind of kept Jimmy so off-balance. I think when Arthur looked back at this, 10 years after it happened, he was even more pleased to see the way it happened and the fact that this lawsuit sort of really went away [Connors dropped it soon after his Wimbledon defeat]. And I don't think he had really bad feelings with Jimmy after that. He wasn't that type of guy. In fact, one of the strengths that he had is he didn't hold grudges and he realized that people had different motives of why they thought things, why they did things, and he tried to accept that and then move on and still try to improve the world.</p><p><b>Eubanks:</b> I think it was a huge moment historically. Obviously, him winning the US Open in '68, signifying the first in the Open era, was a big, historic milestone, but I think everyone knows the prestige that surrounds Wimbledon, and it just fits the reputation and legacy of someone who carried themselves with the dignity and the class of Arthur Ashe. It fits that he was able to come back and win it seven years after his first Grand Slam. Such a historical event, such a historical figure, it's a bit poetic -- being an American -- winning the US Open and also winning here at Wimbledon on these hallowed grounds. It was incredible, and it's such an honor to be able to follow along in his footsteps.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> It makes me feel sad that he's not here to be able to do that [celebrate the 50th anniversary of his title].</p><p><b>Eubanks:</b> I think there are certain names that would just continue to live on throughout time. I think even the younger generations, who may not know much about Arthur and his legacy, say, \"Hey, who is Arthur Ashe, and why do we have the largest tennis stadium in the world named after him?\" And then, I think once you see everything that he was able to accomplish on the court, everything he was able to accomplish off the court as a humanitarian, and just the life that he lived, I think it goes to show it's not just about the number of Grand Slam titles you can win. It's about the impact you have on the sport and the impact on the world. I think that impact will continue to be felt for tennis players and around the world for many children and people for years to come.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> Arthur was a very bright guy. He kept up with current events and certainly he had <a href=\"https://andscape.com/features/arthur-ashe-a-lifetime-of-service/\">a passion for helping other people</a>. He got involved with the apartheid issue, he got involved with heart issues and with AIDS issues. He was a great friend, and he had a good sense of humor and came up with some very funny comments along the way. His favorite T-shirt was \"Citizen of the World,\" and he looked at the big picture in his life, and that was what was most remarkable about him.</p><p><b>Eubanks:</b> I think [what was unique about him was] that calm and that stoic personality that you saw in the heat of battle. He never allowed for his emotions to get too far out of him, no matter how stressful the situation, no matter what type of adversity he dealt with on the court, off the court. He always was respectful, he always was a gentleman, he always was the role model that you would want for kids to be able to watch and still was a champion in his own right. He was able to showcase that you can be a champion and still have a certain respect, a certain class and decorum that many kids and many tennis fans can look and aspire to be like.</p><p><b>Evans:</b> He was highly respected. Arthur didn't change. He always knew exactly what he was doing. And he wasn't a shouter and a yeller and a banner-waver, although later on he did get arrested in D.C. [during a 1985 anti-apartheid rally outside the South African embassy and in 1992 outside the White House protesting for Haitian refugees' rights]. He'd have been disappointed that more Black players didn't come through quicker, but there's been a huge development in that aspect. He would want more. He would be out there helping youngsters become tennis players.</p><p><b>Eubanks:</b> I think it's continued to grow, and it's truly been an honor to be able to be a part of that, to see the generations that have come after. I truly believe in kids being able to see someone that looks like them having success in certain fields will inspire them to want to get involved in that sport, to say, \"Hey, maybe I can do it.\" We're seeing more and more people of color, Black people getting involved in tennis, loving it, from even a fan standpoint getting involved in the sport -- it helps the sport continue to grow, and I think it will allow the cultural significance of what Arthur, Althea [Gibson, the first Black woman to a major title, who won five -- including Wimbledon in 1957 and 1958] and all of the pioneers who came before to continue to live on for many years to come.</p>\n</div></div>"

Instead, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/41120095/edgar-berlanga-biography-boxing-record-fights-more\">Edgar Berlanga</a> -- who lost a terribly one-sided fight to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/38447326/canelo-alvarez-biography-boxing-record-fights-more\">Canelo Alvarez</a> in September -- was elevated to the main event.</p><p>It was clear that Alalshikh was making a statement that he's against the idea of <a href=\"https://x.com/Turki_alalshikh/status/1932607271101473099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">\"Tom &amp; Jerry fights\"</a> (read: where one boxer runs from the other), and Stevenson's last few fights, while dominant, fit the bill. Stevenson didn't take many risks.</p><p>For the duration of the promotion for his WBC lightweight title defense against the offensive-minded William Zepeda, Stevenson promised that he wouldn't be running from his opponent. And when the fight took place at Louis Armstrong Stadium on Saturday, Stevenson not only delivered on his promise, but <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45727691/shakur-stevenson-tops-william-zepeda-unanimous-decision-keep-belt\">he delivered a one-sided drubbing to Zepeda</a> with a near shutout victory.</p><p>And after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45727893/hamzah-sheeraz-posts-fifth-round-tko-edgar-berlanga\">Hamzah Sheeraz wiped out Berlanga</a>, the supposed star of the show in five rounds, it was clear that Stevenson should never, ever be a co-main event fighter again.</p><p>\"I came in here to prove a point,\" Stevenson said after winning a unanimous decision. \"It wasn't the performance I was looking for because I came in here trying to prove a point, I was trying to fight. So, I took more punishment than usual. But at the end of the day, I told y'all whatever it takes to get the job done.\"</p><p>Stevenson landed an absurdly high 52.5% of his punches (295 of 565) over the course of the 12-round fight. Zepeda, while busy, struggled to connect against an opponent who stood right in front of him, landing 272 of 979 punches for 27.8%, according to CompuBox.</p><p>Reading those numbers, you wonder what Stevenson meant when he said that he took more punishment than usual. When Stevenson isn't trying to stay in the pocket, he's using his lateral movement to stay out of range. According to Compubox, Stevenson allows the fewest shots to land compared to other championship-caliber fighters, with a miniscule 5.4 punches per round. On Saturday, Zepeda landed 22.6 punches per round. But Stevenson won 10 of 12 rounds on two judges' scorecards and 11 of 12 rounds on the third scorecard.</p><p>Statement made.</p><p>\"Shakur Stevenson shows he's the real deal with a huge win over William Zepeda,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/Turki_alalshikh/status/1944227694717116567\">Alalshikh posted on X</a> after the fight.</p><p>Whatever the reason there was for him to be in the co-main event, the champion proved that he is good enough to win fights in whatever way he wants. He's a brilliant fighter who shouldn't be forced to fight a different way <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45698930/shakur-stevenson-casual-boxing-fans-william-zepeda\">because casual fans</a> find it unexciting.</p><p>Although knockouts are exciting, Sheeraz's beatdown of Berlanga shouldn't be expected from fighters in order to be in the main event. Boxing is an art, and the greatest practitioners of the sweet science hope to exit the sport with their wits intact. Penalizing brilliant fighters like Stevenson because their opponents aren't good enough to beat them sends the wrong message. This is already a tough sport and asking fighters to bludgeon each other for the sake of entertainment and abandon the defensive side of the game is preposterous.</p><p>Stevenson showed what he could do when he felt like he needed to, but now the onus shouldn't be on him. Instead, his opponents should work harder to find ways to beat him. Hopefully, this is the last time we see a fighter punished for being too good.</p>\n</div></div>"

Konstas totalled an even 50, averaging 8. The 19-year-old now won’t be there for the start of Ashes, and his partner shouldn’t be, though the team’s coterie approach is more likely to protect Khawaja.</p><p>Like the bobsled in Cool Runnings, things went downhill fast. With the lights taking effect to start the evening session, Konstas edged to slip for a duck. Khawaja and Steve Smith both edged into their stumps for 14 and 5 respectively, Australia’s No 4 dismissed after jumping around during a peppering from Alzarri Joseph.</p><p>At 28 for 3, Sabina Park’s modest crowd was roaring like 10 times the size. The new pink Dukes ball was soaring off the pitch. The next streak of three wickets followed soon afterwards, taking the score to 69 for 6, after Travis Head and Alex Carey edged into the slips either side of Beau Webster getting another piece of bowling brilliance from Joseph, seaming the ball away from his defensive shot to beat the bat and hit off stump.</p><p>Green was the one to cope with the bowling, though he was involved in three simple run out chances that the West Indies fielders somehow botched each time. Green finished the night on 42 with some support from his captain Pat Cummins, whose modest tally of 25 balls faced was better than all of the dismissed players.</p><p>With the lead currently contained to 181, West Indies should be feeling good about themselves, but the problem as ever is the batting. After being choked out for 143 during daylight hours, even the current lead would be an unlikely target against the quality of Australia’s attack.</p><figure id=\"b2811442-28bf-4c87-986a-9393b4b1591d\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320d5dc3f19e363b739c6153382e2f0f8d0a5d72/0_0_4674_3116/master/4674.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320d5dc3f19e363b739c6153382e2f0f8d0a5d72/0_0_4674_3116/master/4674.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320d5dc3f19e363b739c6153382e2f0f8d0a5d72/0_0_4674_3116/master/4674.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320d5dc3f19e363b739c6153382e2f0f8d0a5d72/0_0_4674_3116/master/4674.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320d5dc3f19e363b739c6153382e2f0f8d0a5d72/0_0_4674_3116/master/4674.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320d5dc3f19e363b739c6153382e2f0f8d0a5d72/0_0_4674_3116/master/4674.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Shai Hope is bowled by Scott Boland at Sabina Park\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320d5dc3f19e363b739c6153382e2f0f8d0a5d72/0_0_4674_3116/master/4674.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>West Indies batter Shai Hope is bowled by Australia fast bowler Scott Boland on day two of the third Test at Sabina Park.</span> Photograph: Ricardo Mazalán/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Scott Boland peeled the wickets away one by one from the start of the day.

John Campbell, who was moved to No 4 after an injury stopped him opening the previous evening, top-scored with 36. The bowling was tight and the ball gave Australia assistance, but with the sedentary batting, the whole innings was one long non-event. It wasn’t even an anti-climax, but that relies on some initial promise of a peak.</p><p>Boland had the best figures with 3 for 34, vindication for him replacing Nathan Lyon’s spin in this game, while Konstas got one last moment of Test enjoyment with a sensational throw from the boundary into Boland’s waiting hands on the full, allowing the bowler to run out Justin Greaves.</p><p>That contributed to wrapping up the second innings with a lead of 82, an imposing number in the conditions, and the reason the Australians will be comfortable overnight despite yet another batting failure. They might end up as the worst-performing team to win a 3-0 whitewash. As in the first two matches, West Indies are still in with a chance at the business end of the match, but they’ve squandered both to date. Third time lucky is a nice phrase and a poor predictor.</p></div></div>"
