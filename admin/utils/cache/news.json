The Red Bulls are currently eighth in the conference standings and are unbeaten in four of their last five matches, including a 5-3 win against the New England Revolution their last time out. Meanwhile, Lionel Messi and the Herons are fifth in the standings and looking to rebound after a disappointing 3-0 loss to FC Cincinnati.</p><p>Kickoff from Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J. is set for 7:30 p.m. ET. The visitors are +120 favorites (risk $100 to win $120) on the 90-minute money line in the latest New York Red Bulls vs. Inter Miami odds, while the Red Bulls are +175 underdogs. A draw is priced at +260 and the over/under for total goals scored is 3.5.

It was also the sixth time in the past seven games in which Messi has scored two goals.</p><p>\"The reality is we had five games in the last two weeks, four of which were away. It is a complicated stage, especially because of the travel and the lack of rest between games,\" Miami coach Javier Mascherano said after the match. \"The game against Cincinnati was a reflection of the exhaustion the team carries, but now we have a long week. We will use it to give rest to those who are more tired, and with the expectation to recover a couple players that are injured and add them to the roster.\"</p><p>The Red Bulls (9-9-6, 33 points) failed to string together consecutive wins at home and lost to Inter Miami for the second time this season. Mascherano's team is in fifth place in the Eastern Conference, six points behind Philadelphia, but have three games in hand due to its participation in the Club World Cup this summer.</p><p>New York scored its lone goal in the 15th minute when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/148641/Emil-Forsberg\">Emil Forsberg</a> lifted a corner kick in front of Miami goalkeeper <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/297047/Rocco-R%C3%ADos-Novo\">Rocco Rios Novo</a>'s line of sight. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/227054/Alexander-Hack\">Alexander Hack</a>&nbsp;knocked it home for the score despite having defender <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/318181/Federico-Redondo\">Federico Redondo</a> draped all over him.</p><p>Rios Novo made his second start this season for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/102985/Oscar-Ustari\">Oscar Ustari</a>, who sat out with an injury.</p><section id=\"\"><figure><p><img alt=\"Lionel Messi celebrates with teammates after a Miami goal against the New York Red Bulls.\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></p><figcaption>Lionel Messi celebrates with teammates after a Miami goal against the New York Red Bulls.</figcaption><div><p><span>Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><hr></section><p><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/121021/Jordi-Alba\">Jordi Alba</a>, who exited the game in the 84th minute with what appeared to be a leg cramp, scored his first goal of the season in MLS league play off a cross from Messi in the 24th minute to tie the score 1-1.</p><p>Inter Miami took the lead for good in the 27th when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/125088/Luis-Su%C3%A1rez\">Luis Suarez</a>, who assisted on the first goal, sent a ball ahead to Messi, who then directed it quickly to Alba, who then crossed it back to Segovia for an easy shot into the back of the net.</p><p>In the third minute of first-half stoppage time, Redondo advanced the ball into the Red Bulls' box but could not fire off a shot. Segovia, though, surged in and fired a shot off a rebound past Carlos Miguel Coronel for a third goal.</p><p>Messi followed with goals in the 60th and 75th minutes to seal the outcome, to the delight of the scores of Miami supporters in the stands despite it being a road game.</p><p>\"No, it's not a surprise [to see the madness that Messi causes] because I have been with him for eight years at Barca and 15 with Argentina,\" Mascherano said. \"Especially in places where he doesn't go with continuity people go crazy. I have seen it in airports, hotels, he generates this everywhere. I don't think it's only because of his football talent, but because of his admiration as an athlete and the way he's transcended football.</p><p>\"Leo Messi, Michael Jordan, Rafa Nadal, these are people that have transcended the sport. We are very privileged the people that are close and can witness this.\"</p><p>Messi increased his total goals in MLS games to 18 this season and has contributed on 27 scores.

      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><div><ul><li><p>ESPN News Services</p></li></ul><p><span>Jul 19, 2025, 04:18 PM ET</span></p></div><p>PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- The question <a data-player-guid=\"38cbeebe-aac8-fb36-dce0-cf45436086e4\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9478/scottie-scheffler\">Scottie Scheffler</a> was asking of himself at the start of the week could very well be posed to those chasing him in the British Open.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/45745697/scottie-scheffler-take-success-golf-point\">What's the point?</a></p><p>Scheffler delivered another example Saturday at Royal Portrush of why he has dominated golf the last three years. He was the only player in the last eight groups not to make a bogey on his way to a 4-under 67 that allowed him to open a four-shot lead as he goes for the third leg of the career Grand Slam.</p><p>Scheffler has won the last 10 times he has led after 54 holes. It's never easy, no matter how he makes it look. But on this gorgeous day he was in full command of his game, and he now is in prime position to get his second major win of the year.</p><p>He was helped by a 6-iron to 10 feet for eagle on the par-5 seventh, and saved by three big par saves, two on the back nine, to keep everyone at a distance.</p><p>\"Talking of execution, he's probably the best in the business right now,\" <a data-player-guid=\"65575c5e-0ef2-9f58-6495-42da8638a332\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/3470/rory-mcilroy\">Rory McIlroy</a> said after a 5-under 66 that brought him to only within six shots of Scheffler.</p><p>Scheffler had the golf world buzzing earlier this week when he said celebrations don't last but a few minutes. He loves the competition. He loves the work. But in terms of fulfillment, he often questions why he wants to win so badly when the thrill of winning is fleeting.</p><p>Ahead of him is competition, and still plenty of work.</p><p>He was at 14-under 199, four shots ahead of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9221/haotong-li\">Haotong Li</a> of China, who delivered his own mystery by saying he had no idea how he recovered from the full swing yips a few years ago to be in the final group of a major for the first time.</p><p>Another shot back was <a data-player-guid=\"a11204a7-ef27-3f00-a28e-358ee5984e77\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9037/matt-fitzpatrick\">Matt Fitzpatrick</a>, who was tied with Scheffler through six holes but couldn't stay with him when the No. 1 player began to pull away. Fitzpatrick missed a pair of short par putts and had to settle for a par 71.</p><p>The biggest roars belonged to McIlroy, so much that it felt as though all of Northern Ireland was behind him. He opened with three birdies in four holes. The roar that shook Royal Portrush came on the par-5 12th when McIlroy holed a 55-foot eagle putt that gave him a spark and the gallery hope -- even though he still was six behind.</p><p>He produced only one more birdie the rest of the way and still faced a big climb.</p><p>\"I played well enough today to at least feel like I have a chance tomorrow,\" McIlroy said. \"Yeah, it's going to be tough to catch him tomorrow if he keeps playing the way he does. But if I can get out tomorrow and get off to a similar start to what I did today, get the crowd going ... you never know. But I just need to go out and play another really good round of golf tomorrow and see what happens.\"</p><p>But this championship is now in the hands of Scheffler, who has been No. 1 in the world longer than anyone since <a data-player-guid=\"b967ea91-ed2c-fad0-cf10-ba1dda3f869e\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/462/tiger-woods\">Tiger Woods</a>. And there was nothing Saturday to indicate he was going to make it easy on anyone chasing him.</p><p>\"I'm just trying to execute, not overthinking things,\" Scheffler said. \"I feel like I've been doing the right thing so far, and I'm looking forward to the challenge of tomorrow.\"</p><p>After his first three-putt of the tournament -- making par after reaching the par-5 second hole in two shots -- Scheffler made a 10-foot par putt that was as big as any. In deep trouble behind the 11th green, he hacked out to 10 feet to save par, then saved another par from the deep grass left of the 14th fairway.</p><p>Royal Portrush has a nasty par-3 at No. 16 known as \"Calamity Corner.\" Scheffler made birdie there for the third straight day, this time a 3-iron that settled 15 feet below the cup.</p><p>Each shot helped him pull away from the field. Each shot moved him closer to the Claret Jug, to go along with the PGA Championship he won by 5 shots in May and the two Masters green jackets he has won in the last four years.</p><p>In fact, if Scheffler maintains his advantage Sunday, he'd join Ben Hogan in 1953 and Woods in 2000 as the only golfers to win multiple majors by four or more strokes in the same year.</p><p>\"Scottie is ... it's inevitable,\" McIlroy said. \"Even when he doesn't have his best stuff, he's become a complete player.\"</p><p>This is what McIlroy noticed last year, when Scheffler won nine times around the world. What impressed him was that Scheffler played so many bogey-free rounds.</p><p>Scheffler picked a great time for another one.</p><p>\"I think the card could look stress-free, but I had two really nice par saves on the back nine that were key ... two really important putts,\" he said. \"I think any time you can keep a clean card around a major championship, you're going to be having a pretty good day.\"</p><p>Fitzpatrick did his best to keep pace, but he missed a 4-foot par putt on the 13th, got a bad bounce on the 17th that led to another bogey and wound up five shots behind.</p><p>\"Just didn't make any putts. I didn't hit it close enough,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"Drove it well enough, didn't hit it close enough. Just made way less putts than Scottie.\"</p><p>Scheffler will be paired in the last group with Li, who made history in 2020 at the PGA Championship when he held the 36-hole lead, becoming the first player from China to lead in a major. Li didn't make his first bogey until the 13th hole, and he dropped another shot on the 18th by driving into a pot bunker.</p><p>Scottish Open champion <a data-player-guid=\"5298f3ab-57a0-3df2-b4c6-4b659bf19334\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/469075/chris-gotterup\">Chris Gotterup</a>, in his first appearance in the British Open, had a 68 and joined the group at 8-under 205 that included McIlroy, <a data-player-guid=\"91d6bef0-8a59-459a-04ed-11121ff3d5e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5408/harris-english\">Harris English</a> (68) and <a data-player-guid=\"ab95205e-c964-97c7-c309-9841844bc546\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5553/tyrrell-hatton\">Tyrrell Hatton</a> (68).</p><p>This is Scheffler's largest 54-hole lead in a major -- he was up by three shots at the PGA Championship and in the 2022 Masters.</p><p><i>Information from ESPN Research and The Associated Press was used in this report.</i></p>\n</div></div>"

He is the lone first-round pick in this year's draft class who has not signed his rookie deal.</p><p>Stewart, the 17th overall pick out of Texas A&amp;M, did not participate in any of the offseason workouts because of a contract dispute over the language that could potentially void the guaranteed money in his deal. Before Saturday, Stewart and linebacker Demetrius Knight, the team's second-round pick, were the only members of Cincinnati's six-person class who had not inked their rookie deals.</p><p>However, Knight made his deal official on Saturday afternoon ahead of the starting training camp. The difference in the details is notable and shows the gap in Stewart's negotiation. According to a source familiar with the negotiations, the percentage of Knight's signing bonus that was paid up front was not offered to Stewart. Knight's signing bonus is projected at $3.2 million, according to OverTheCap.com. Stewart is projected to receive a signing bonus of $10.4 million.</p><p>Earlier in the week, Texas A&amp;M coach Mike Elko said on \"SportsCenter\" that Stewart has no intentions of returning to college to play for the Aggies. Under the current collective bargaining agreement between the NFL Players Association and the NFL, the team that drafted a player retains their rights through the following year's draft. Since Stewart declared for the draft after his junior year, he would need to likely sue the NCAA in order to gain his final year of eligibility.</p><p>Cincinnati's veterans are set to report on Tuesday, one day before the team begins its training camp in downtown Cincinnati.</p>\n</div></div></article></section></div>"

The Londoner was unable to repeat the heroics of last September, when he sent Joshua to the canvas four times in a Round 5 KO win. In contrast to that coruscating win, Dubois was left counted out in a fight Usyk dictated from the start.</p><p>It was even better than the last time Usyk defeated Dubois, by Round 9 stoppage, in August 2023 and he is now expected to box again later this year, possibly against New Zealand's Joseph Parker.</p><p>Since being stopped in Round 9 by Usyk in August 2023, Dubois has been much improved, with stoppage wins over Jarrell Miller, Filip Hrgovic and Joshua. But he was unable to establish any authority in front of his home fans.</p><p>Usyk was quickly into his rhythm and did most of the work in Round 1, piercing Dubois' guard with his southpaw jab.</p><p>Dubois, who is 11 years younger than Usyk and weighed in 26 pounds heavier than Usyk, put together a strong series of punches late in Round 1.</p><p>But Usyk produced some quality work in Round 2, as he slipped Dubois punches to repeatedly land solid left hands.</p><p>A big left hook momentarily shook Dubois in Round 3, as Usyk's smart movement denied Dubois any openings.</p><p>Usyk complained about a low blow in Round 4 before a strong finish to the round. In Round 5, Usyk landed a left-right combination as Dubois began to look more open and a glancing right to the head sent Dubois to his knees for the first count.</p><p>Moments after Dubois got up, Usyk finished it. After Dubois missed with a right hand, Usyk uncorked a sweeping left hook to return the Englishman to the canvas. Dubois was left flat on his back and was counted out.</p><p>It was a smart, savage and scintillating stoppage from imperious Usyk who is beyond reach it seems for any of the current heavyweights.</p>\n</div></div>"

Paul, the 20-year veteran, is a free agent. The Clippers want to add more playmaking and ballhandling, and the franchise's former quarterback from the Lob City era and all-time assists leader is a possibility.</p><p>\"What I'd say about Chris is he's a great player,\" Frank said when asked if the Clippers will sign Paul next. \"He's a great Clipper. He obviously possesses some of the qualities we [are looking for]. And, of course, we're strongly, strongly considering him.\"</p><p>The Clippers' strong offseason also included adding power forward <a data-player-guid=\"796e45a0-b375-dfdf-c240-b7550add4966\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3908845/john-collins\">John Collins</a> and center <a data-player-guid=\"3496fbc1-fa88-c332-7f91-f015006e0c8b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez\">Brook Lopez</a> and creating salary cap flexibility so they can be opportunistic in the next two summers to potentially go after stars.</p><p>Beal signed with the Clippers for two years and $11 million with a player option, his agent Mark Bartelstein told ESPN's Shams Charania on Wednesday. Collins will make $26.5 million in the final season of his contract. <a data-player-guid=\"35b0f455-b1df-0986-121d-27d2b6c18122\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a> agreed to a two-year, $81.5 million deal, and the second year has a player option and is partially guaranteed.

But I think everyone is super, super motivated.\"</p><p>Frank noted that Harden was working out Saturday a few feet away from him in the practice facility as he was on a call with reporters. Harden played a role in helping recruit Beal to the Clippers, even spending 30 minutes on the phone with Bartelstein, according to Frank.</p><p>Beal averaged 17 points and shot 38.6% from 3 in 53 games last season for the Suns. It was the fewest points Beal has averaged in a season since 2014-15. Beal saw his status as a full-time starter change as the guard came off the bench in 15 games, the first time he was a reserve since the 2015-16 season.</p><p>But the Clippers believe they will be a better fit for Beal. They will be getting a 32-year-old guard who has averaged 21.5 points, 4.3 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 37.6% from behind the arc for his career.</p><p>Beal not only will start at shooting guard but is also expected to help fill the shooting and scoring void left by <a data-player-guid=\"4941d040-1812-cbb0-27bf-598cd624bc84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2595516/norman-powell\">Norman Powell</a>, who was traded to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"81e3212c-30ef-9b1b-5edb-453b13ff265a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a> in the deal that helped the Clippers land Collins.</p><p>Beal's shooting and scoring is an ideal fit alongside Harden and <a data-player-guid=\"87ff907c-c68c-a82d-1215-37e05d0c62ef\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a>, and he can help take the ballhandling and distributing burden off the former.</p><p>\"Not to take any sort of slight at Phoenix, but playing with James is a whole lot different than what their situation was,\" Frank said. \"Obviously, Brad had great success playing with John Wall [in Washington]. He actually had great success playing with Russ [Westbrook in Washington]. So, we can look at those situations.</p><p>\"I think some of the areas that, especially in his Washington days, that he was able to explore with not the same level of talent [there], I think we'll be able to get a little bit more out of [here].

To his right, more fans pushed against the ropes just to try and get a little closer. As he waited to hit, McIlroy allowed himself a smile. The chants soon began.</p><p>\"Rory! Rory! Rory!\"</p><p>They had been going on all day -- loud as he made birdie on the opening hole, louder still when he tapped in for another birdie on 2 and as loud as they had been all week when he hit his approach shot on the par-4 fourth and started 3-under through four. Eight holes later, on the 12th, the noise reached a climax. McIlroy's 56-foot eagle putt tipped into the bottom of the hole. A fist pump. A roar. This was the moment they had all been waiting for.</p><p>\"The roar when this ball was in was insane. It was insane all day, but the noise after that putt went in was incredible,\" McIlroy said. \"That was a really cool moment ... could be one of the coolest moments I've ever had on a golf course.\"</p><p>All day, the thousands of fans -- be it from Northern Ireland or beyond -- seemed to carry McIlroy from hole to hole. Birdie or bogey, the noise was there, crescendoing as he reached every green.</p><p>At every turn, through the dunes and the crosswalks, at every crowded hill and gathering spot, the crowd was a reminder that McIlroy was, and has been, the main event this week. Outside of the hotel next to the fourth fairway, a group of workers all stood in a single file line to watch McIlroy come through. Next to the green on the fifth, fans made the climb from the nearby beach to the top of a dune that allowed them to get a glimpse of the action.</p><p>Once McIlroy was able to hit off that 17th tee, his shot found the right gallery. One fan picked up his ball -- anything to feel closer to their hometown hero. While standing in a swarm of his followers, McIlroy replaced it, lined up the tough approach shot over a greenside bunker and landed it safely on the green. He walked forward and the crowd that had split like the Red Sea to let him in re-formed behind him, getting louder by the second.</p><p>\"Rory! Rory! Rory!\"</p><p>At various points throughout Saturday, the dream of a homecoming win to them, and to McIlroy, felt alive. And yet, in between moments of madness, the sport's most inevitable force loomed in the silence.</p><p>Enter <a data-player-guid=\"38cbeebe-aac8-fb36-dce0-cf45436086e4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9478/scottie-scheffler\">Scottie Scheffler</a>.</p><p>The 17th green and the 13th green at Royal Portrush are connected and, as McIlroy stalked his birdie putt, Scheffler stood on top of the opposite hill. Scheffler's tee shot landed -- where else? -- pin high. McIlroy had been stealing glimpses at scoreboards throughout the day to see where he stood. This time, the harsh reality of what he was going up against was staring right back at him.</p><p>\"Scottie Scheffler is -- it's inevitable,\" McIlroy said. \"Even when he doesn't have his best stuff. He's just so solid. He doesn't make mistakes.\"</p><p>Scheffler made par on 13 and added another birdie on Calamity Corner, the tough, long, par-3 16th hole that has given players fits all week. Not Scheffler. He has birdied it all three days.</p><p>\"There doesn't seem to be any weakness there,\" McIlroy said. \"Whenever you're trying to chase down a guy like that, it's hard to do.\"</p><p>It's not just McIlroy's dream that Scheffler is foiling. Matthew Fitzpatrick is five shots back heading into Sunday. He was only one shot back to start the day. <a data-player-guid=\"4c308ece-76d6-b5d7-697c-7d1d3535f1d0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5409/russell-henley\">Russell Henley</a> shot 65 on Saturday and <a data-player-guid=\"e23e62a8-8995-6b06-42f2-018c8a27e916\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/10140/xander-schauffele\">Xander Schauffele</a> shot 66. Both are seven shots behind and feel like long shots heading into Sunday.</p><p>\"When I watch Scottie play a lot, he just looks blacked out to me, just doing his thing. He's just in his own world and nothing's going to bother him,\" Schauffele said. \"He gets to that place often, which is a good thing for him.\"</p><p>\"He's unbelievable,\" said <a data-player-guid=\"91d6bef0-8a59-459a-04ed-11121ff3d5e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5408/harris-english\">Harris English</a>, who, like McIlroy, is six shots back. \"I can't say anything bad about the guy. It's impressive to watch, and what he's doing is incredible.\"</p><p>Even <a data-player-guid=\"f407b075-96bc-e0d7-7e69-6eef7abf0c48\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9221/haotong-li\">Haotong Li</a>, who did not fade and shot a round of 69 that put him four shots back of Scheffler and in Sunday's final group, couldn't help but acknowledge his standing.</p><p>\"Four shots behind, kind of like play for second,\" Li said. \"Especially play[ing] with world No. 1.\"</p><p>There's something almost unnerving about the way that, as players can't help but recognize Scheffler's exceptional performances, Scheffler himself will downplay them at every step. Even when presented with an objective example of his own greatness -- the fact that he has closed out nine straight 54-hole leads -- Scheffler shrugs.</p><p>\"Your guess is as good as mine,\" Scheffler said to the question of why he has been such an effective closer. \"I like being out here competing.\"</p><p>Even as he bemoans the fickle nature of winning like he did earlier this week, Scheffler's obsession with competing -- whether he likes it or not -- has brought him to a place where he is being chased by everyone while he is chasing history, the ghosts of golf's past and a <a data-player-guid=\"b967ea91-ed2c-fad0-cf10-ba1dda3f869e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/462/tiger-woods\">Tiger Woods</a> comparison that continues to gain, not lose, steam. With a victory Sunday, Scheffler will be the fourth player to win The Open, the Masters and the PGA Championship before their 30th birthday. The last to do that was Woods.</p><p>McIlroy and everyone else behind him have to believe they control their destinies on Sunday. But in reality, their hopes hinge on the performance of a guy who vanquishes dreams for a living.</p>\n</div></div>"

It was a dreadful lapse in judgement, becoming the quickest red card in Women's Euros history, too, and it set the Germans up for the biggest fight of their lives.</p><p>And fight they did. Germany grappled for 120 minutes, with Berger at the heart of the fight back, making nine saves. One of those was an impeccable diving save to her right, arm stretched behind her to prevent an own goal as <a data-player-guid=\"6cfbfe85-4a84-3bb0-95a9-e08550fc4df6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/354419/janina-minge\">Janina Minge</a>'s clearance almost ended up in her own net.

She called 50 fouls across 120 minutes -- but only showed five yellows -- making the game too stop and start for either team to really get going.</p><p>St Jakob Park had been electric all evening, but the stadium erupted when Germany's momentum finally gathered in extra time. Despite being faced with a barrage of pacey French attacks, Germany had some of the best opportunities of the evening, and the fans were behind them all the way.</p><p>Whistles, shouts and chants flooded the stadium to the point that any French support was being drowned out by echoes of boos and jibes inundating the ground.</p><p>Both teams showed impressive travelling support with 34,128 fans in house. They were divided in who they wanted to win, but they were aligned on one thing: the refereeing was inconsistent and shoddy and the vocal supporters made their feelings heard.</p><p>Despite this, there was always a glimmer of hope, for Germany against France, with the top European side having a dismal track record in major tournaments.</p><p>France have never beaten Germany in a major women's tournament before, now stretching to 12 losses in 12 games. They did defeat Germany in the Nations League finals, though it was a short-lived victory.</p><p>This is the third time France have been eliminated from the Euros in a penalty shootout, too, a thought that likely would have been on their minds as they entered the final stage of the game.</p><p>There was a start contrast in the body language between the German and French players as the shootout began. The Germans were confident while the French were nervous, some not looking in the right direction and were visibly shaken as Berger made perfect saves.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45777867\" data-cerebro-id=\"687c1f76f2f39a6611756ac1\" data-title=\"Laurens: France's Euro 2025 exit a 'massive failure'\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0719%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0719%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0719%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45777867\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:42</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Laurens: France's Euro 2025 exit a 'massive failure'</p><p>Julien Laurens reacts to France's penalty shootout defeat to Germany to miss out on a semifinal spot at Euro 2025.</p></div></div><p>France's struggles go beyond penalty kicks though. This is the fourth Euros quarterfinal they've lost. In nine major tournament quarterfinals, they've only surpassed this stage once -- during 2022 Euros, when they then lost to Germany in the semifinals.</p><p>The French team has, in seven Euros, five World Cups and three Olympics, never made a tournament final. For all of their experience and ability, France have fallen short desperately and unforgivably short in major tournaments. Their form outside of Euros and World Cups poses a stark difference to their lacklustre form when in a competition.</p><p>Simply put, it was the quintessential France performance at a major tournament. They had a perfect opportunity served on a platter to take advantage of the eight-time winners with only ten players on the pitch. After facing a red card in the final group stage game to get here, Germany then lost 4-1 to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bbcbd33c-6b7a-5014-8fb5-fa60cd55a021\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2764\">Sweden</a>, proving their weaknesses.</p><p>France should have learned from that group stage game, especially, after saving the penalty which would have surely sealed their fate. The opportunity was there to rattle the former champions, but France were unable to take it.</p><p>They could not conjure an attack worthy of stealing back a lead. They were consistently profligate, with two goals were disallowed due to offside and only half of their 18 shots were on target. That being said, Germany's defence was stalwart, organised and they frustrated France, forcing them into poor decision making and applying pressure to make the final touch ineffective.</p><p>They will be celebrating long into the night but face a long recovery ahead of them before facing <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b40064c7-ecaa-338f-74a8-a3eb43071ec3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=17640\">Spain</a> in the semifinal on Wednesday. They will need to figure a plan out quickly, especially as they'll be without Nusken (yellow car accumulation) and Hendrich (red card) along with Guilia Gwinn's extended absence (knee injury), as their profligacy in front of goal will not suffice against the World Champions.</p><p>France are now back to the drawing board. With their tournament record continuing to get worse, despite significant changes under new manager Laurent Bonadei and a fresh-faced squad, the curse has continued. Perhaps the shock omission of <a data-player-guid=\"baccbb9f-8c10-6014-e4cc-1afb260050a3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158816/wendie-renard\">Wendie Renard</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"132f74ed-cec5-3828-85cb-534a0aa31f6f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158820/eugenie-le-sommer\">Eugénie Le Sommer</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"8f6f27f7-d642-d3cb-4e69-da91a43ffc3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/219119/kenza-dali\">Kenza Dali</a> has hurt their campaign more than first realised.</p><p>The inquest is unlikely to be pretty, but with a World Cup in two years, France have time to hopefully conjure some answers. Germany, meanwhile, are one step closer to reaching a second-straight Euros final.</p>\n</div></div>"

Usyk also dropped Dubois to the canvas earlier in Round 5 with a right hand in an utterly imperious performance from the Ukrainian.</p><p>As long as Usyk (24-0, 15 KOs) does not lose a potential trilogy fight with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/38406539/tyson-fury-biography-boxing-record-fights-more\">Tyson Fury</a> in April 2026, or another title defence later this year probably against former WBO titleholder Joseph Parker, the undisputed heavyweight king will go down in history as the best heavyweight for the past two decades. Not only that, Usyk can also be considered the best cruiserweight for three decades since the likes of Dwight Muhammad Qawi and Evander Holyfield ruled in the mid-1980s.</p><p>Usyk was the first undisputed cruiserweight champion and reigned the division from 2016 to 2018, before stepping up to heavyweight. He has now made five heavyweight title defences against top level opponents -- former champions and current champions.</p><p>Usyk's achievements at heavyweight have surpassed what he managed at cruiserweight, and he has beaten the best of his era (Fury, Dubois and Anthony Joshua) -- twice --  to put any arguments beyond doubt as to who is the best. Dubois argued he scored a legitimate body punch in their first encounter two years ago, but it was (rightly) ruled a low blow. Usyk overwhelmed the big-punching, spirited Briton the rest of the fight for a ninth-round TKO, and in the rematch produced an even more emphatic conclusion.</p><p>Parker (36-3, 24 KOs), 33, will beat his friend Fury to Usyk it seems, as WBO mandatory challenger.</p><p>\"The WBO say he has to fight Joseph Parker next, so that will be the fight,\" Queensberry Promotions promoter Frank Warren said.</p><p>It is hard to envisage how a resurgent Parker, who is in the best form of his life, will threaten Usyk's legacy.</p><p>Parker won the WBO belt with a points decision over Andy Ruiz in 2016, then lost it in a third defence and title unification fight versus Anthony Joshua in March 2018. Impressive wins over Deontay Wilder, Zhilei Zhang and Martin Bakole in the last two years have resurrected Parker's career, but Usyk's ring IQ, movement and sublime skills are on a different level to Parker and the others.</p><p>Fury and Joshua, both two-time world champions, had good wins over Wladimir Klitschko, and Fury also stopped the dangerous puncher Wilder twice in world title fights.</p><p>But Usyk's unblemished record, with a total 13 world title fight victories as well as a 2012 Olympic gold medal, stacks up better. Usyk's fellow countrymen Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, with their superior reach and height could well have made things difficult for Usyk.</p><p>Wladimir's jab-and-grab strategy was impregnable at times during his nine-and-a-half year reign, and it may have frustrated Usyk to the point of defeat. Vitali and Wladimir ruled the heavyweight division between them, holding all the belts at one time, from 2004 when Vitali became champion following his loss on cuts to Lewis in 2003, to when Fury boxed the ears off Wladimir in 2015.</p><p>Wladimir made a staggering 18 title defences in a second reign as unified world champion (2006-2015), with his best wins over David Haye, Alexander Povetkin and Jean Marc Mormeck. Vitali (45-2, 41 KOs) made two defences of the WBO belt, before 10 defences over two reigns as WBC champion, which were interrupted by injury, with destructive wins over Samuel Peter, Danny Williams and Herbie Hide.</p><p>- <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45777455/usyk-knocks-dubois-become-undisputed-heavyweight-champion\" target=\"_blank\">Usyk knocks out Dubois to become undisputed heavyweight champion</a></strong><br>\n- <strong><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45737495/in-camp-oleksandr-usyk-scenes-boxing-heavyweight-champion\" target=\"_blank\">In camp with Oleksandr Usyk: Behind the scenes with a heavyweight champion</a><br>\n- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45768242/pacquiao-barrios-usyk-dubois-tszyu-fundora-live-boxing-updates-results-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">Fight results: Usyk stops Dubois, regains undisputed championship</a></strong></p><p>The Klitschko brothers' numbers are greater than those so far compiled by Usyk (23-0, 14 KOs), who has made five heavyweight title defences and six cruiserweight title defences. But Usyk has better names on his record, and is a three-time undisputed world champion.</p><p>Usyk became the first recognised undisputed world heavyweight champion since Lewis (41-2, 32 KOs), who beat such fighters as all-time greats Holyfield, Mike Tyson and Klitschko over three reigns as champion, with 17 wins, 2 losses, and 1 draw in world heavyweight title fights.</p><p>Like Vitali, Wladimir and Lewis, Usyk launched his professional career off the back of an Olympic gold medal triumph and as he closes in on the end of his career, whether it is later this year against Parker or next year against Fury, his legacy looks the strongest of any heavyweight since Lewis.</p>\n</div></div>"

UFC 318 lands in New Orleans with Dustin Poirier looking to go out on top. Poirier headlines his final PPV event in his retirement fight when he takes on Max Holloway for a third at the Smoothie King Center with the ceremonial \"BMF\" title on the line.</p><p>Poirier is 2-0 in their series, submitting Holloway in 2012 and winning an interim lightweight title fight via decision in 2019.

If people appreciate that, I appreciate them for recognizing it.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Elsewhere on Saturday night, a former Bellator MMA champion gets another shot in the Octagon when Patricio Pitbull makes the walk against Dan Ige at featherweight. Pitbull earned two divisional titles under Bellator at featherweight and lightweight, but struggled mightily in his UFC debut against Yair Rodriguez in April. Now, he takes on Ige, who is 2-3 in his last five but coming off a TKO over Sean Woodson his last time out.</p><p>Below is the complete fight card for UFC 318, along with the latest odds.

Plus, we dive into what lies ahead for the top performers in 2025-26.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Best rookies in Vegas</h2><p><b>1. <a data-player-guid=\"3da4dcbe-ff57-3082-a02a-48ec86e1ba8b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4702384/nique-clifford\">Nique Clifford</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e266c4ea-9af3-1bd8-06fb-fd608fd30e26\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings\">Sacramento Kings</a> </b><br>\n<b>2. Cooper Flagg, Dallas Mavericks </b><br>\n<b>3. <a data-player-guid=\"6d6b4455-4c69-3296-96e1-e20ed80ec16f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5239590/liam-mcneeley\">Liam McNeeley</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"377633c2-0dd1-91a1-83c0-9ed2d0c00ea1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets\">Charlotte Hornets</a> </b></p><p>The 23-year-old Clifford was among the most polished rookies in this year's class after five years of college experience, averaging 18.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 5.0 assists in Vegas. Given how much of Clifford's breakout as an upperclassman was related to shooting, it's encouraging to see him go 9-of-17 (53%) from the NBA 3-point line. It's not realistic to keep that up, but his savvy playmaking will be a strength so long as opponents respect his jumper.</p><p>By design, Flagg's role in summer league was more akin to what we usually see from second-year players getting force-fed additional opportunities on the ball. Playing as a point forward, Flagg had the third-highest usage rate thus far. He'll need to tighten his handle to play that sort of role in NBA games, but he showed the ability to stay efficient at high volume against the Spurs, getting to the foul line a remarkable 13 times.</p><p>McNeeley has outplayed teammate <a data-player-guid=\"d706a855-1bca-34f6-9dd7-6684dd22c3ee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5061575/kon-knueppel\">Kon Knueppel</a>, the No. 4 pick, who bounced back after a rough debut. Taken 29th, McNeeley had 22 points, 12 rebounds and 6 assists -- better than his career high in rebounds at UConn, and one of his top assist totals -- in his debut. McNeeley made three 3-pointers in both games he played, encouraging after he shot 32% from the college line.</p><hr><h2>Most promising rookies</h2><p><b>1. Cooper Flagg, Mavericks </b><br>\n<b>2. Dylan Harper, San Antonio Spurs </b><br>\n<b>3. <a data-player-guid=\"432b4847-f726-3711-898d-9e507c8f5bf2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5238230/tre-johnson\">Tre Johnson</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"64d73af6-b8ec-e213-87e8-a4eab3a692e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/wsh/washington-wizards\">Washington Wizards</a> </b></p><p>Flagg's potential speaks for itself. But Harper was one of the two players with an even higher usage rate (39%), and although his efficiency buckled under that load (36% shooting, including 1-of-8 on 3s), we saw plenty of the skills that made him the No. 2 pick. When Harper is playing with the talented teammates who sat courtside at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, including <a data-player-guid=\"0e8844b2-d923-3926-82d2-f19a29d69490\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama\">Victor Wembanyama</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"26c7892b-12d0-3b1d-9645-f881921a1a20\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4845367/stephon-castle\">Stephon Castle</a>, he might have more assists than the 2.0 per game he averaged -- and fewer shot attempts.</p><p>No. 3 pick <a data-player-guid=\"d5a0355a-95f4-38ed-b96d-ea0302ebbd0b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5124612/vj-edgecombe\">VJ Edgecombe</a> showed plenty of promise in his debut at the Salt Lake City summer league (28 points, 10 rebounds, 4 assists), but since we're including only Vegas, I'll give No. 6 pick Tre Johnson the edge here. Johnson's size, including a wingspan measured longer than 6-foot-10 at the combine, separates him from score-first shooting guards who can't get off their shot as easily. He shot 69% on 2s and 5-of-11 from 3, looking smooth in the process.</p><hr><h2>Most intriguing rookie</h2><p><b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5217746/yang-hansen\">Yang Hansen</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a> </b></p><p>After Flagg, no rookie drew more eyeballs than Hansen, the highest draft pick (No. 16) from China since Yi Jianlian in 2007. Hansen's passing from the perimeter stands out at 7-foot-1. He had 15 assists in four games, with several of them being of the highlight variety. Hansen also showed better shot blocking than expected (2.3 per game) and went 4-of-12 from 3-point range.</p><p>He must improve his rebounding, having averaged just 5.0 per game, but he didn't look like a reach during summer league.</p><h2>Best undrafted rookie</h2><p><b><a data-player-guid=\"6f14c1f9-a90a-3b6c-82df-cac4f5feb197\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5144071/eli-john-ndiaye\">Eli John N'Diaye</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"15096a54-f015-c987-5ec8-55afedf6272f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks</a></b></p><p>N'Diaye, a native of Senegal who has played with Spanish power Real Madrid, signed a two-way contract with the Hawks after going undrafted. He played just one game in Vegas before suffering a wrist injury, but he had 12 points and six boards in 21 minutes.</p><hr><h2>Slowest-starting rookie</h2><p><b><a data-player-guid=\"a34d3e64-4f77-38de-8d04-34456599255d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5144091/jeremiah-fears\">Jeremiah Fears</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9461f397-7882-94c0-c18c-e89bdc9e570e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans Pelicans</a></b></p><p>The Pelicans' giant frontcourt of first-round picks <a data-player-guid=\"7fc094e9-59a0-3026-bbd8-6208f3ae1826\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5061589/yves-missi\">Yves Missi</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"0e7f21a8-df8c-3ace-8cf6-c7ff07c756fa\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4869780/derik-queen\">Derik Queen</a>, both primarily centers, didn't leave much room for Fears to operate offensively. Still, his shoot-first style raised questions about his ability to make an immediate contribution.

Manny Pacquiao makes his return from a four-year absence (and retirement) to try and once again capture gold. Pacquiao is set to take on WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in the main event from the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/manny-pacquiao-vs-mario-barrios-fight-card-date-odds-ppv-price-start-time-location-complete-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">MGM Grand Garden Arena on Saturday night in Las Vegas</a></span>.</p><p>Pacquiao was last seen in a pro fight in August 2021 when he was outclassed by Yordenis Ugas, which led to his eventual retirement from the sport. Now, after being inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame, Pacquiao wants to give it one more go at the age of 46 against a champion who has had an up-and-down career to date.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I've been a challenger many times and it's always the same feeling,\" Pacquiao said. \"I'm excited to take the belt. He's a good fighter also, but our job is to entertain the fans. We're gonna give them a real fight. Saturday night it's going to be a great fight. It's been a while that I've been out of the ring, but I'm still active and exercising all the time. I'm going to prove to everyone that I'm in great condition.\"</p><p>The undercard also sees a terrific rematch for the unified junior middleweight titles when champion Sebastian Fundora takes on Tim Tszyu. Fundora earned a split decision win in their first meeting that turned into a bloody war thanks to an inadvertent elbow that Fundora landed on Tszyu's head that opened a nasty gash. Now, Tszyu looks for his revenge against an opponent he had an argument for beating in the first fight in March 2024.</p>\n        \n\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/boxing-predictions-best-bets-odds-top-picks-to-consider-for-pacquiao-vs-barrios-usyk-vs-dubois-2/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Boxing predictions, best bets, odds: Top picks to consider for Pacquiao vs. Barrios, Usyk vs. Dubois 2</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brent Brookhouse                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Boxing predictions, best bets, odds: Top picks to consider for Pacquiao vs. Barrios, Usyk vs. Dubois 2\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/17/1c86cd52-7dec-4c96-b5d8-5004963eb5ff/thumbnail/270x152/ca80e7615e1659c975629ad89c0f2dc0/mario-barrios-hat.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Plus, former titleholder Isaac Cruz is back in action at junior welterweight.

I think we had close to 40 players in our league meeting,\" Collier said. \"I think it just sends a really strong message that we're standing really firm on the certain areas that we feel really strongly about that we need to improve on, and I think we got that message across.\"</p>\n<p>In October 2024, the Women's National Basketball Players Association opted out of the current CBA, which will run through the end of the 2025 season. Since then, little progress has been made on a new CBA. The league and the WNBPA met in person this weekend for the first time since December, but the talks only served to frustrate the players.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"I think [Thursday's] meeting was good for the fact that we could be in the same room as the league and the board of governors and that type of thing, but I think, to be frank, it was a wasted opportunity,\" <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">New York Liberty</a> star <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678022/breanna-stewart/\">Breanna Stewart</a> said. \"We could have really gotten into a deeper dive of everything, but we there was a lot of fluff that we couldn't get past, and it sucks because situations like that aren't gonna happen again because players are playing for different teams and different leagues and this is the only time to have a group together like this.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/breanna-stewart-says-wnba-players-cba-meeting-with-league-was-a-wasted-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Breanna Stewart says WNBA players' CBA meeting with league was a 'wasted opportunity'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Jack Maloney                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Breanna Stewart says WNBA players' CBA meeting with league was a 'wasted opportunity'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/18/43d80224-372d-4d80-b661-63e38c4553e2/thumbnail/270x152/e6da32f2921ea74855f188a30868f920/breanna-stewart-imagn.png\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>From the day the players opted out, they have made it clear they are seeking \"transformational change.\" While the league has been sympathetic to issues such as family planning, it has not been as keen on the players' demands for higher salaries and a bigger share of revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Based on their most recent proposal, we just aren't able to get to a place where we're actually even talking about the same thing,\" Stewart said. \"So I think that's the hardest thing. Our first offer and then their counter was, like, black and white.\"</p>\n        \n\n\n<p>The two sides hope to have a new agreement in place by October, but are quickly running out of time to make that happen. While it's possible for deadlines to be extended -- the most recent CBA was ratified in January 2020, as commissioner Cathy Engelbert noted Saturday during her pre-All-Star Game press conference -- any delay would have affect the rest of the offseason calendar.&nbsp;</p><p>This is set to be a busy and groundbreaking winter. Two new expansion teams, the Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo, will enter the league, and nearly every player that is not on a rookie scale contract is set to be a free agent. The expansion drafts and free agency cannot take place until a new CBA is in place.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither side wants to rush through key portions of the offseason, or worse, have a work stoppage. But as of now, neither side has shown any willingness to budge. The players have been a united front all weekend, as their warm-up shirts re-emphasized.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"Yeah, I think for myself that was the best part of [the meeting] being in the room and there's over 40 other players in this league, and I'm sure a lot more would have loved to be in there if they were in Indianapolis,\" Clark said. \"And I think that's the most powerful thing is all the girls from across the league just being in that room together... like [Collier] said, we should be paid more. And hopefully that's the case moving forward as the league continues to grow. I think that's something that's probably the most important thing that we're in the room advocating about.\"</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Before the game she met the media with fellow All-Star captain <a data-player-guid=\"3050c42f-4845-9e46-c003-1b0adb4c5e14\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3917450/napheesa-collier\">Napheesa Collier</a> of the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d815e23c-aa3e-3490-d7be-f876d1e30e8a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-lynx\">Minnesota Lynx</a>. The two teased each other about whose team was going to win, and they addressed some questions about the on-going collective bargaining agreement negotiations.</p><p>Clark also spoke about how she's been feeling during a celebratory weekend hosted by her franchise</p><p>\"When the injury happened, it was pretty frustrating considering I knew what the coming days were gonna hold for myself,\" she said. \"But ... [this weekend] wasn't going to be taken away from me. Sure, maybe I'm not able to play the games, but I can still be here and participate, and I have a ton of friends and family in town that are having a really good time. So I've been trying to enjoy the best I can.</p><p>\"Still getting to be around and be a part of everything is really important for myself and for the fans. They've been out in full force, whether they're coming into the game tonight or whether they're just enjoying all the festivities that are around our city. So just really happy, not only for Indianapolis and state of Indiana and our organization, but really just the league. I think the weekend has been absolutely incredible.\"</p><p>As a rookie, Clark had 4 points, 10 assists and 2 steals in last year's All-Star Game in Phoenix. She played for Team WNBA, which beat Team USA 117-109 in a contest that helped prepare the U.S. squad for the Olympics. Clark went on to lead the league in assists and 3-pointers as the Fever made the playoffs for the first time since 2016.</p><p>Clark had never missed a game in her college career at Iowa or in her first WNBA season. But this year, she has been out 10 regular-season games plus the Commissioner's Cup final because of injuries to her left quad, left groin and right groin.</p><p>\"I feel like there's been quite a few injuries over the course of the beginning of the season for quite a few people,\" said Clark, who had to miss Saturday's game along with fellow injured All-Stars <a data-player-guid=\"940914f8-5293-4fb8-0f4c-7c5436f2c5bd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4398674/rhyne-howard\">Rhyne Howard</a> of the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bceea196-4263-d338-17a7-9ae40f3aed3f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-dream\">Atlanta Dream</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"d4c403bb-a2c8-ed6b-aeaa-c290d8afea9b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4281929/satou-sabally\">Satou Sabally</a> of the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"514d18a9-00a8-d52b-dda2-37d707f19bd0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-mercury\">Phoenix Mercury</a>. \"So a lot of people [are] in the same boat as myself.</p><p>\"I'm not going to say I've been getting around-the-clock treatment. I've been still trying to enjoy this weekend, and having the balance of that at the same time [as] soaking all of this in. And, you know, once [Sunday] comes around, I will completely shift my focus to getting as healthy as possible.\"</p><p>The Fever, 12-11 and Commissioner's Cup champions, have three games this coming week: Tuesday at New York (ESPN, 8 p.m. ET), Thursday at home vs. Las Vegas and Sunday at Chicago (ABC, 3 p.m. ET).</p>\n</div></div>"

One maul steal by England flanker Chandler Cunningham-South led to what appeared to be a try for Joe Carpenter, the debutant full-back, until video found a knock-on. There was no problem with the wing Caden Murley’s finish for the third, snappishly directed by Ford. His conversion went wide and that, finally, was the half, 19-0 to England.</p><p>England scrum-half Jack van Poortvliet scooted over shortly after the restart. Ford converted. It took a while for the fifth try to arrive, but it did, through a break by wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and support from Harry Randall, the substitute scrum-half. Ford converted for 33-0. Gabriel Oghre, debutant replacement hooker, scored from a maul and another bench new boy, Charlie Atkinson, converted.</p><p>The game ended with consolation for the Eagles, flanker Christian Poidevin (son of Australia great Simon) running smart from a lineout to put Shilo Klein, the replacement hooker, over the line at last. The conversion was wide, the game was done.</p><p>With World Cups on US soil in 2031 (men) and 2033 (women), World Rugby could do with a more competitive product.

The final four countries include a defending Euro champion, a women's World Cup title holder, a tournament dark horse, and a David among multiple Goliaths. Only one of them can lift Europe's most prestigious trophy on Sunday, July 27.</p><p>The road to the semifinals was a chaotic journey in a tournament that has been filled with plenty of drama and goals. <span>England</span> seek a repeat as the Lionesses get stronger each game, while <span>Spain</span> have impressed with their signature flair in possession on the hunt to add a Euro title to their World Cup triumph. <span>Germany</span>&nbsp;are a proven foe with physical play and organization, and Italy remain a surprising underdog, making history along the way.</p><p>The final four will clash in an epic semifinal round to determine who will advance to compete for Europe's ultimate prize. The stakes keep getting higher, and all eyes will be on the final two nations. But which two teams could be a dream final pairing? As England battle Italy on Tuesday and Germany face Spain on Wednesday, it's time to have a little fun by ranking four potential Euro finals:</p><h2>No. 4: Italy vs. Spain</h2><p>It's Cinderella against the machine dream killer. Italy have slammed the door shut on outsiders' low expectations with help from Cristina Girelli's three clutch goals in the tournament. They'd be hopeful to replicate a 1997 Euro semifinal upset against Spain in a championship final, but this is a different era. Spain's playmaking and firepower could be a nightmare for Italy's compact defense, but anything can happen in tournament football.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>No. 3: England vs. Germany</h2><p>A proper European heavyweight battle, as some might say. But not me. Sure, these are two of the most celebrated teams in Europe, but this would ultimately be a repeat of the 2022 Euro final. As memorable as Chloe Kelly's 2022 championship celebration was when the squad etched their names into history, sequels are just never as good as the originals. Still, getting the chance to see goalkeepers Ann-Katrin Berger and Hannah Hampton go head-to-head would be another great chapter in the rivalry.</p><h2>No. 2: Italy vs. Germany</h2><p>I'll be upfront and say this match has the potential to be a defensive gridlock, and that's just never fun for neutrals or tournament football. However, a dark horse and an underdog battling it out for supremacy while a pair of Europe's elite are on the outside looking in? That's the stuff a hater's dreams are made of. Germany's physicality and set-piece dominance against Italy's creative counterattacks could be a fun final. There's always the possibility this pairing could be more than just a bunch of congestion. In fact, maybe there's room for more tactical exchanges with a sprinkling of chaos -- a perfect recipe for a championship.&nbsp;</p><h2>No. 1: England vs. Spain</h2><p>If Germany vs. England is too early of an unwanted sequel, then England vs. Spain is more of a spin-off between titans. A rematch of the 2023 World Cup final, Spain's march in the 2025 Euro comes after a 2022 Euro quarterfinal exit and a 2023 World Cup triumph. La Roja's backline has hardly been put through the ringer this tournament, and the Lionesses could be the ultimate test.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Spain's <span>Esther Gonzalez</span> leads the Golden Boot race with four goals, and Alexia Putellas has a stacked resume for player of the tournament. Meanwhile, England's goal scoring has been spread across the roster, while Alessia Russo leads the team in assists (three) and general relentlessness. Will a tactical overplay by Sarina Wiegman prove golden, or will Spain's staple possession-based \"tiki-taka\" cement their status as champions? Either way, it'll be a battle for a definitive reign as Europe's dominant force.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Whether Pacquiao's decision to return to the ring proves to be ill-advised or a moment that grows his legend is still to be seen.</p><p>At 46, Pacquiao is older than George Foreman when Foreman defeated Michael Moorer to win the IBF and WBA heavyweight titles in 1994. Pacquiao also hasn't fought professionally in just shy of four years, retiring after being beaten by Yordenis Ugas in August 2021. That Ugas fight came more than two years after Pacquiao's previous bout.</p><p>Pacquiao is boxing's only eight-division world champion, winning his first title, the WBC flyweight belt, at 19. He kept climbing in weight and finding more and more success as he emerged as one of boxing's biggest stars alongside rival Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p><p>Pacquiao and Mayweather would eventually find their way into the ring together, ending years of \"will they, won't they\" negotiations and producing a less-than-thrilling fight a few years past its best-by date. Pacquiao had already lost a close split decision to Timothy Bradley and been knocked out cold in his fourth bout with Juan Manuel Marquez before meeting Mayweather.</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"I've been enjoying training camp like I did in the past. Just like when I was 26-years-old,\" Pacquiao said at the final press conference. \"The discipline is still the same. Even with my layoff, my passion is still there.</p><p>\"I'm here because I love to go toe-to-toe. I want to give the fans what they want. That's my goal every time I step into the ring.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/why-manny-pacquiao-believes-that-even-at-46-an-upset-could-be-brewing-against-mario-barrios-on-saturday/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Why Manny Pacquiao believes that, even at 46, an upset could be brewing against Mario Barrios on Saturday</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brian Campbell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Why Manny Pacquiao believes that, even at 46, an upset could be brewing against Mario Barrios on Saturday\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/16/04712343-0d36-4266-8a85-fc6e0f37ab2f/thumbnail/270x152/140f1efd689d61f5a29e55cc12f7ca1f/manny-pacquiao-camp-smile.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Despite the Mayweather loss, Pacquiao would go on to have two more championship reigns at welterweight, the last of which came with his win over Keith Thurman in 2019 when Pacquiao was 40 years old, more than 20 years after he won his first world title.</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"I'm here again for another big fight. I'm so thankful to the fans for all their support,\" Pacquiao said. \"Without the fans, boxing is dead. I really appreciate their support. I'm OK being the underdog. I've been the underdog many times. I'm always bringing surprises.\"</p><p>Now, Pacquiao looks to come back from a retirement, and a six-year stretch that has seen him fight professionally just once, to face a young, hungry champion in Barrios.</p><p>\"We're back in boxing again. We're going to show the world that boxing is still alive and kicking. Manny Pacquiao is still here. I'm back,\" Pacquiao said. \"It's amazing to still be fighting here in this arena. It's a blessing to still be here giving good fights for the fans. I'm excited for the fans.</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"I respect Barrios, he's a champion and he works hard also. This is for the fans.\"</p><p>Barrios is no stranger to the spotlight. In 2021, he fought Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis, giving a fine account of himself in a slugfest before Davis scored a stoppage in the 11th round. Barrios followed up that loss with a decision loss to Keith Thurman in another headline fight.</p><p>Barrios has not lost since dropping the decision to Thurman, picking up the interim WBA welterweight title with a win over Yordenis Ugas along the way. That title was eventually upgraded to a full championship after Terence Crawford moved up in weight after becoming undisputed at 147 pounds.</p>\n        \n\n<p>In November, Barrios made the first defense of his world title, going to a draw with Abel Ramos.</p><p>\"It's been a long camp and we're ready to step in there come Saturday,\" Barrios said. \"This is historic. Hats off to Pacquiao for daring to be great. But it's my time now and I'm gonna show that come Saturday.</p><p>\"I'm not going in there looking for the knockout, but I'm going in there with bad intentions and power in both hands. I won't hesitate to pull the trigger.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>The undercard features another title bout when WBC and WBO junior middleweight champion Sebastian Fundora takes on Tim Tszyu for a second time. Fundora earned the title with his first win over Tszyu, a 2024 split decision that was a contender for Fight of the Year that became a bloody war thanks to a stray elbow. Now fresh off TKO win over Chordale Booker in March, Funodra looks to repeat the feat once more.</p><p>Plus, former titleholder Isaac Cruz is back in action at junior welterweight. Cruz was expected to face Angel Fierro, but Fierro was forced to withdraw from the bout on Friday due to a bad weight cut. In his place will be Omar Salcido. And opening the PPV is a featherweight showdown between former junior featherweight champion Brandon Figueroa and Joet Gonzalez.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the rest of the card with the latest odds before making a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Barrios vs. Pacquiao fight card, odds</h2><p>Odds via BetRivers</p><ul><li>Mario Barrios (c) -275 vs. Manny Pacquiao +210, WBC welterweight title</li><li>Tim Tszyu -155 vs. Sebastian Fundora (c) +125, WBC junior middleweight title</li><li>Isaac Cruz -550 vs. Omar Salcido +380, junior welterweights</li><li>Brandon Figueroa -260 vs. Joet Gonzalez +200, featherweights</li><li>David Picasso -2000 vs. Kyonosuke Kameda +950, junior featherweights</li><li>Mark Magsayo -800 vs. Jorge Mata +500, lightweights</li><li>Gary Allen Russell Jr. -1600 vs. Hugo Castaneda +800, junior lightweights</li></ul><h2>Prediction</h2><p>Pacquiao looks to be in fantastic physical shape ahead of the fight, and he has spoken several times vowing to show \"the old Pacquiao\" on Saturday night. Therein lies the question at the center of this fight: Will we actually see the old Pacquiao or just <em>an</em>&nbsp;old Pacquiao.</p><p>Against Ugas, Pacquiao didn't show much of what made him a special fighter in the past, and he left the ring beat up and looking like a fighter ready to move on from fighting. It's hard to see how four years out of the ring and four more years of life have transformed Pacquiao into someone who will show up in the ring looking like a younger version of himself.</p><p>Barrios is also going to have some big physical advantages in the fight, most notably four inches of reach and more than six inches of height. Pacquiao is going to have to navigate those disadvantages in order to get inside and get any offense going. It's unlikely that it will be an easy task as Barrios is very active with his punches, which should let him punish Pacquiao before Pacquiao can get close enough to let his hands go.</p>\n        \n\n<p>At some point, it seems there's a fair chance that Barrios hurts Pacquiao enough that the fight gets stopped, whether it's Pacquiao being unable to rise from the canvas or the referee or corner stepping in to save Pacquaio from further punishment. <strong><em>Pick: Mario Barrios via TKO8</em></strong></p><p><strong>Who wins Mario Barrios vs. Manny Pacquiao</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and which method of victory prop could bring a massive return?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/manny-pacquiao-vs-mario-barrios-accomplished-boxing-analyst-reveals-selections-for-july-19-welterweight-title-fight/#ttag=071825_agg_cbssports_picks_boxing_other_JoshNagel_MarioBarriosMannyPacquiao\" target=\"_blank\">Join SportsLine here to see which bets you need to make for the fight</a>, all from the accomplished veteran combat sports analyst who has consistently delivered winners.</strong></p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

It was a dreadful lapse in judgement, becoming the quickest red card in Women's Euros history, too, and it set the Germans up for the biggest fight of their lives.</p><p>And fight they did. Germany grappled for 120 minutes, with Berger at the heart of the fight back, making nine saves. One of those was an impeccable diving save to her right, arm stretched behind her to prevent an own goal as <a data-player-guid=\"6cfbfe85-4a84-3bb0-95a9-e08550fc4df6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/354419/janina-minge\">Janina Minge</a>'s clearance almost ended up in her own net.

She called 50 fouls across 120 minutes -- but only showed five yellows -- making the game too stop and start for either team to really get going.</p><p>St Jakob Park had been electric all evening, but the stadium erupted when Germany's momentum finally gathered in extra time. Despite being faced with a barrage of pacey French attacks, Germany had some of the best opportunities of the evening, and the fans were behind them all the way.</p><p>Whistles, shouts and chants flooded the stadium to the point that any French support was being drowned out by echoes of boos and jibes inundating the ground.</p><p>Both teams showed impressive travelling support with 34,128 fans in house. They were divided in who they wanted to win, but they were aligned on one thing: the refereeing was inconsistent and shoddy and the vocal supporters made their feelings heard.</p><p>Despite this, there was always a glimmer of hope, for Germany against France, with the top European side having a dismal track record in major tournaments.</p><p>France have never beaten Germany in a major women's tournament before, now stretching to 12 losses in 12 games. They did defeat Germany in the Nations League finals, though it was a short-lived victory.</p><p>This is the third time France have been eliminated from the Euros in a penalty shootout, too, a thought that likely would have been on their minds as they entered the final stage of the game.</p><p>There was a start contrast in the body language between the German and French players as the shootout began. The Germans were confident while the French were nervous, some not looking in the right direction and were visibly shaken as Berger made perfect saves.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45777867\" data-cerebro-id=\"687c1f76f2f39a6611756ac1\" data-title=\"Laurens: France's Euro 2025 exit a 'massive failure'\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0719%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0719%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0719%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250719_COM_SOC_Analysis_Laurens_Frances_Euro_2025_exit_a_massive_failure_20250719_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45777867\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:42</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Laurens: France's Euro 2025 exit a 'massive failure'</p><p>Julien Laurens reacts to France's penalty shootout defeat to Germany to miss out on a semifinal spot at Euro 2025.</p></div></div><p>France's struggles go beyond penalty kicks though. This is the fourth Euros quarterfinal they've lost. In nine major tournament quarterfinals, they've only surpassed this stage once -- during 2022 Euros, when they then lost to Germany in the semifinals.</p><p>The French team has, in seven Euros, five World Cups and three Olympics, never made a tournament final. For all of their experience and ability, France have fallen short desperately and unforgivably short in major tournaments. Their form outside of Euros and World Cups poses a stark difference to their lacklustre form when in a competition.</p><p>Simply put, it was the quintessential France performance at a major tournament. They had a perfect opportunity served on a platter to take advantage of the eight-time winners with only ten players on the pitch. After facing a red card in the final group stage game to get here, Germany then lost 4-1 to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bbcbd33c-6b7a-5014-8fb5-fa60cd55a021\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2764\">Sweden</a>, proving their weaknesses.</p><p>France should have learned from that group stage game, especially, after saving the penalty which would have surely sealed their fate. The opportunity was there to rattle the former champions, but France were unable to take it.</p><p>They could not conjure an attack worthy of stealing back a lead. They were consistently profligate, with two goals were disallowed due to offside and only half of their 18 shots were on target. That being said, Germany's defence was stalwart, organised and they frustrated France, forcing them into poor decision making and applying pressure to make the final touch ineffective.</p><p>They will be celebrating long into the night but face a long recovery ahead of them before facing <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b40064c7-ecaa-338f-74a8-a3eb43071ec3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=17640\">Spain</a> in the semifinal on Wednesday. They will need to figure a plan out quickly, especially as they'll be without Nusken (yellow car accumulation) and Hendrich (red card) along with Guilia Gwinn's extended absence (knee injury), as their profligacy in front of goal will not suffice against the World Champions.</p><p>France are now back to the drawing board. With their tournament record continuing to get worse, despite significant changes under new manager Laurent Bonadei and a fresh-faced squad, the curse has continued. Perhaps the shock omission of <a data-player-guid=\"baccbb9f-8c10-6014-e4cc-1afb260050a3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158816/wendie-renard\">Wendie Renard</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"132f74ed-cec5-3828-85cb-534a0aa31f6f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158820/eugenie-le-sommer\">Eugénie Le Sommer</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"8f6f27f7-d642-d3cb-4e69-da91a43ffc3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/219119/kenza-dali\">Kenza Dali</a> has hurt their campaign more than first realised.</p><p>The inquest is unlikely to be pretty, but with a World Cup in two years, France have time to hopefully conjure some answers. Germany, meanwhile, are one step closer to reaching a second-straight Euros final.</p>\n</div></div>"

Anyone who has followed its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">sports betting</a>&nbsp;picks could have seen big returns.

However, this is his first appearance in a major championship since 2022, and he only has one top-15 finish at a major during his career. He has done well to hang around thus far, but he will be playing in a pressure-packed final pairing on Sunday and the model does not have him staying in the top five by the end of the round.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-updated-projected-leaderboard-surprising-sunday-predictions/#ttag=07192025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipSunday\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to fade at SportsLine</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Another surprise: Xander Schauffele, an 80-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.&nbsp;</p><p>The defending Open Championship winner put together one of the most impressive rounds of the day on Saturday, shooting 5 under to move into eighth place on the leaderboard. Schauffele is only three shots back of Li for second place, and he can lean on his major experience from last year. He also won the PGA Championship last year while finishing inside the top eight at all four majors, so he knows what it takes to make a run on Sunday. The model likes him as a deep longshot to win and recommends him as a top-five bet (+170) as well.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-updated-projected-leaderboard-surprising-sunday-predictions/#ttag=07192025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipSunday\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to back at SportsLine</a>.</p><h2>How to make 2025 Open Championship picks</h2><p>The model is targeting three massive triple-digit longshots who could make a surprising run on Sunday.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-open-championship-odds-picks-proven-golf-model-reveals-updated-projected-leaderboard-surprising-sunday-predictions/#ttag=07192025_agg_cbssports_picks_golf_pgatour_model_OpenChampionshipSunday\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see the model's picks here</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>So, who will win the Open Championship 2025, and which longshots stun the golfing world?

He has taken on a high-level of competition and now will face a 35-year-old Veretennikov, who is 0-2 in the UFC. Veretennikov is a decent kickboxer with punching power, but Prado is a much more dynamic striker. Veretennikov is 12 years older and seems like a journeyman that the prospect Prado can bounce back against.

Game prediction</h2><p>Collier has been a force to be reckoned with this season, but she also made sure to pick a well-rounded roster with players who can dominate on both sides of the court. While Collier leads the league in points per game, Reese leads in rebounds and Alyssa Thomas leads in assists. Meanwhile, Stewart is a versatile forward who can contribute in multiple areas. Team Clark still has a lot of star power, but the squad wull miss Clark's shooting and passing abilities against such tough competition. Team Collier appears to have a bit of an edge.&nbsp;<strong>Prediction</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>Team Collier 124, Team Clark 117</strong></p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Now, he takes on Ige, who is 2-3 in his last five but coming off a TKO over Sean Woodson his last time out.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/dustin-poirier-gets-to-walk-off-into-the-sunset-as-one-of-mmas-rare-good-guys-im-just-living-my-life/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Dustin Poirier gets to walk off into the sunset as one of MMA's rare good guys: 'I'm just living my life'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Dustin Poirier gets to walk off into the sunset as one of MMA's rare good guys: 'I'm just living my life'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/18/363806da-7873-4cbc-b8aa-9384e537a8fb/thumbnail/270x152/dbae27f904e17e5366ddc9d30b53eb8f/dustin-poirier-peace-presser.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>With so much happening on Saturday night, let's look closer at the full fight card with the latest odds before we get to our staff predictions and picks for the PPV portion of the festivities.</p><h2>UFC 318 fight card, odds</h2><ul><li>Max Holloway (c) -130 vs. Dustin Poirier +110, lightweights, \"BMF\" title<br></li><li>Roman Kopylov -240 vs. Paulo Costa +200, middleweights</li><li>Kevin Holland -450 vs. Daniel Rodriguez, welterweights</li><li>Dan Ige -210 vs. Patricio Pitbull +175, featherweights</li><li>Daniel Zellhuber -550 vs. Michael Johnson +400, lightweights</li><li>Vinicius Oliveira -165 vs. Kyler Phillips +140, bantamweights</li><li>Brendan Allen -205 vs. Marvin Vettori +170, middleweights</li><li>Francisco Prado -140 vs. Nikolay Veretennikov +120, welterweights</li><li>Ateba Gautier -550 vs. Robert Valentin +400, middleweights</li><li>Islam Dulatov -600 vs. Adam Fugitt +430, welterweights</li><li>Jimmy Crute -280 vs. Marcin Prachnio +230, light heavyweights</li><li>Ryan Spann -220 vs. Lukasz Brzeski +180, light heavyweights</li><li>Brunno Ferreira -700 vs. Jackson McVey +500, middleweights</li><li>Carli Judice -300 vs. Nicolle Caliari +240, women's flyweights</li></ul><p>With such a massive main event on tap, the crew at CBS Sports went ahead with predictions and picks for the main card.&nbsp;<em>Here are your pick makers: Brent Brookhouse (Combat sports writer), Brian Campbell (Combat sports writer), Shakiel Mahjouri (writer), Michael Mormile (producer) and Brandon Wise (senior editor).</em></p>\n        \n\n<h2>UFC 318 picks, predictions</h2><table data-title=\"7x6 Table\"><tbody><tr><th><br>   </th><th>Campbell</th><th>Brookhouse</th><th>Mahjouri</th><th>Mormile</th><th>Wise</th></tr><tr><td>Poirier vs. Holloway</td><td>Poirier</td><td>Holloway</td><td>Holloway</td><td>Holloway</td><td>Holloway</td></tr><tr><td>Costa vs. Kopylov</td><td>Costa</td><td>Costa</td><td>Kopylov</td><td>Kopylov</td><td>Kopylov</td></tr><tr><td>Holland vs. Rodriguez</td><td>Holland</td><td>Holland</td><td>Holland</td><td>Holland</td><td>Holland</td></tr><tr><td>Ige vs. Pitbull</td><td>Pitbull</td><td>Ige</td><td>Pitbull</td><td>Pitbull</td><td>Ige</td></tr><tr><td>Zellhuber vs. Johnson</td><td>Zellhuber</td><td>Zellhuber</td><td>Zellhuber</td><td>Zellhuber</td><td>Zellhuber</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Poirier vs. Holloway</h2><p><strong>Campbell:&nbsp;</strong>The 36-year-old Poirier has no shortage of motivation to author a storybook ending to his battle-tested UFC career, in his home state of Louisiana, no less. But even though he's a slight betting underdog against the younger Holloway, who begins his first full-time run as a 155-pounder, Poirier has vowed to let it all hang out in his final fight and appears to have gotten himself in as good of shape as we have ever seen him. Poirier remains the bigger fighter and more natural lightweight. And the same thing that lifted him past Holloway in their 2019 rematch for the interim title -- his edge in punching power -- remains a major part of the equation in their trilogy. In about the most perfect setting for a career sendoff as UFC has ever facilitated, Poirier will have the crowd and the mental edge of having already defeated him twice. Not to mention, Holloway is fresh off of the first knockout loss of his career.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brookhouse: </strong>I would certainly love to see Poirier end his story on a high, but that's so rarely the case when it comes to prizefighting. Not to go full \"MMA math\" with the pick, but both men's respective showings against Justin Gathje are key to where they stand at this moment in time. While Poirier was flattened by a brutal kick, Holloway outworked Gaethje before daring him to stand and trade, producing one of the most iconic moments in UFC history. Holloway's pace and accuracy are still top-notch, and he just seems like he's ready to finally get a win over Poirier.</p><p><strong>Mahjouri: </strong>Holloway's performance against Justin Gaethje was illuminating. This isn't the same fighter Poirier big brothered in 2019. Holloway can fill out a lightweight frame while retaining the speed and movement that made him a remarkable featherweight champion. Yes, he's coming off his first knockout loss, but I credit that more to Topuria's power than Holloway's deteriorating chin. It wouldn't surprise me if Poirier sweeps the series, but something tells me Holloway is a touch sharper these days.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Costa vs. Kopylov</h2><p><strong>Campbell:&nbsp;</strong>The explosive former title challenger has been wildly inconsistent since his 2020 loss to Israel Adesanya and enters this co-main event showcase having lost four of his last five overall. So, while it's understandable because of that to see Costa as the betting underdog against Kopylov, who enters having won six out of his last seven, it doesn't tell the full story. At 34, Costa remains dangerous at all times and has fought well in each of his recent three decision losses. The biggest thing holding Costa back from the winning column has been his increasingly cavalier approach to his game planning. A natural counterpuncher, Costa focuses too much on swinging for the fences rather than winning rounds. But with the combination of him badly needing a win and Kopylov having not defeated elite competition throughout his recent streak, there's enough confidence to suggest a big-time bounce back for Costa is in order. If his occasionally unhinged behavior at Wednesday's final press conference is any indication, as Costa spoke more about his current beef outside the cage with Khamzat Chimaev than the threat of Kopylov, it shows that the wildcard Costa is motivated to defend his spot in the title picture.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brookhouse:</strong> Kopylov hasn't exactly faced a murderer's row on his 6-1 run since 2022, not that such a run is ever easy in the Octagon. Costa figures to provide far more resistance than those Kopylov opponents. This is a dangerous fight for both men, but Costa is the man who needs the win more and has more experience against high-level competition. As long as Costa keeps his head on his shoulders and fights to his strengths rather than looking for a wild brawl, he has the tools to get it done and pick up a badly needed victory.</p><p><strong>Mahjouri:&nbsp;</strong>Kopylov's game is evolving. The striking phenom developed his grappling after losing to Anthony Hernandez. That's enough to win me over against Costa. \"Borrachinha\" is a talented striker, but his commitment to fighting is questionable. Costa has experience, though it's worth noting he hasn't beaten someone under 38 years old since 2018. Kopylov's striking, recent improvements and relative youth are the difference makers.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Holland vs. Rodriguez</h2><p><strong>Campbell:&nbsp;</strong>Entering his fourth fight of 2025 (with announced ambitions to finish with seven) and his second in the last 42 days, Holland remains on pace to be remembered as the Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone of the era immediately after the UFC Hall of Famer's came to a close. If it were up to Holland, he would fight every weekend to support a lifestyle he has referred to as expensive. And while Holland has made ill-advised decisions in the past to accept difficult middleweight bouts on short notice regardless of how it might stunt his current streak as a fringe title contender at welterweight. Luckily for Holland, he's entering his third straight fight at 170 pounds and is riding a two-fight win streak with a renewed sense of swagger. Even if Holland doesn't ever shake his \"Cowboy\" ways, at 32, he remains a difficult out for anybody in the division. Rodriguez, at 38, is riding a two-fight win streak of his own but isn't nearly as fresh as Holland in his current form. This one should be fun and competitive with a Holland stoppage win not out of the question.</p><p><strong>Mahjouri:&nbsp;</strong>Holland hasn't looked this serious since knocking out Ronaldo Souza in 2020. Credit that to his committed welterweight campaign after consecutive wins against Vicente Luque and Gunnar Nelson. Rodriguez is another once-touted contender in rebuild mode. \"D-Rod\" is a dogged striker, but lacks the well-roundedness to manage Holland's various threats. Give me Holland by KO or submission.</p><p><strong>Who wins UFC 318: Holloway vs. Poirier 3, and how exactly does the fight end?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ufc-318-odds-picks-seasoned-mma-analyst-reveals-selections-for-holloway-vs-poirier-and-other-new-orleans-matchups-on-july-19/#ttag=07192025_agg_cbssports_picks_ufc_mma_kylemarleyexpert_UFC318HollowayPoirier\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert</a>&nbsp;who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.</strong></p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

The former eight-division champion has decided to return to boxing after nearly four years away to try and win another world title at the age of 46 on Saturday. He challenges WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in the main event of a PBC on Prime PPV at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.</p><p>Pacquiao has not fought professionally since August 2021 when he lost a WBA welterweight title fight to Yordenis Ugas. Adding to that inactivity, the Ugas fight was Pacquiao's first fight in more than two years when he defeated Keith Thurman by split decision for the WBA welterweight title.</p><p>Despite this, Pacquiao, 46, is looking to do the unthinkable and knock off a 30-year-old champion to beat his own record as the oldest man to win a welterweight title, an accomplishment achieved when Pacquiao was 40.</p>\n        \n\n<p>The undercard features another title bout when WBC and WBO junior middleweight champion Sebastian Fundora takes on Tim Tszyu for a second time. Fundora earned the title with his first win over Tszyu, a 2024 split decision that was a contender for Fight of the Year that became a bloody war thanks to a stray elbow. Now fresh off TKO win over Chordale Booker in March, Funodra looks to repeat the feat once more.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the fight card with the latest odds.

Instead, following a brief struggle stretch, McIlroy was second on the odds board behind Scottie Scheffler.</p><p>That has proven to be the correct decision by oddsmakers as Scheffler shot a career-low round of 64 in a major championship to move into a one-stroke lead entering Moving Day. While McIlroy is firmly in contention -- far better than he stood at the weekend in 2019 at Royal Portrush when he missed the cut -- he's seven back of his toughest competitor with only so much time remaining to narrow the gap and surpass the No. 1 player in the world.</p><p>Eighteen-hole co-leaders Matt Fitzpatrick is just one back of Scheffler, while Harris English, Brian Harman, Robert MacIntyre, Tyrrell Hatton and Tony Finau are some of the other notable names between Scheffler and McIlroy on the leaderboard. The Claret Jug and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-british-open-purse-prize-money-payouts-for-every-golfer-from-17-million-purse-at-royal-portrush/\" target=\"_blank\">$3.1 million winner's share from the 2025 Open purse</a></span> are still completely up for grabs, and with so much golf left to play, anything can happen at Royal Portrush.</p><p>While attending The Open Championship is undoubtedly a memorable experience, simply being able to watch golf on one of the game's grandest stages each year is an incredible treat.

But the knockout was complete and the culmination of another masterclass by Usyk who, in only his eighth fight as a heavyweight, having moved up from cruiserweight, sealed his domination of boxing’s flagship division.</p><p>Usyk raised his arms high as Dubois managed the slow, bleak walk back to the refuge of his shocked team. The champion then sank down on his knees on the blue canvas, covering his face with the gloves as the magnitude of his brilliant performance sank in. Usyk has now regained the IBF title which boxing politics had taken from him and gifted to Dubois last year. That largely meaningless trinket joins the WBA, WBC and WBO baubles which Usyk already owns and restores his status as the unanimous king of the heavyweight division – a position he first achieved 14 months ago when beating Tyson Fury. Dubois joins both Fury and Anthony Joshua in having suffered successive defeats by the Ukrainian wizard.</p><figure id=\"5d422ee5-1f59-47b1-9bf5-ab16cc38ecbd\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74943adb3cc3e41615033b8c3ce570a66f697c0/0_0_3451_2301/master/3451.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74943adb3cc3e41615033b8c3ce570a66f697c0/0_0_3451_2301/master/3451.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74943adb3cc3e41615033b8c3ce570a66f697c0/0_0_3451_2301/master/3451.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74943adb3cc3e41615033b8c3ce570a66f697c0/0_0_3451_2301/master/3451.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74943adb3cc3e41615033b8c3ce570a66f697c0/0_0_3451_2301/master/3451.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74943adb3cc3e41615033b8c3ce570a66f697c0/0_0_3451_2301/master/3451.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Daniel Dubois on the canvas in the fifth round\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c74943adb3cc3e41615033b8c3ce570a66f697c0/0_0_3451_2301/master/3451.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.70964937699216\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Daniel Dubois on the canvas in the fifth round.</span> Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Before he left the dressing room to start the fight Dubois was embraced by his father, Stan, who has exerted such a controlling influence over his career while always predicting that he would one day become the dominant heavyweight on the planet. Usyk, however, awaited.</p><p>Dubois walked to the ring first as the words “It’s my redemption story” were emblazoned across the screens inside Wembley. By the time he reached the entrance to the arena he was moving at a fast lick, almost breaking into a little jog at one point, looking full of menacing intent. Dennis Brown’s old-school reggae classic, Want To Be No General, boomed around him.</p><p>At the first sight of the great Ukrainian, chants of “U-syk … U-syk … U-syk” reverberated around Wembley as he began his far more stately march to the ring. An eerie version of Ave Maria accompanied him. His face was etched in concentration and determination until, climbing over the ropes, he raised his right arm high. He was kissed and hugged by his cornermen just before the first bell.</p><p>Usyk landed the first jabs as he showed his readiness to match Dubois in an immediate desire to control the centre of the ring. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Boxing</a> out of his usual southpaw stance, Usyk snaked out his crisp right jab, clipping Dubois cleanly. But with 30 seconds left in the round Dubois backed up Usyk in his corner. Usyk recognised the danger and managed to ghost away and then detonate a hard left against Dubois’ head.</p><figure id=\"a25ca31b-35ea-40cd-b4b3-1c638b42cee7\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715b3b2e144fe2bb15a47900c48e39ca32a150bf/0_0_5033_3369/master/5033.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715b3b2e144fe2bb15a47900c48e39ca32a150bf/0_0_5033_3369/master/5033.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715b3b2e144fe2bb15a47900c48e39ca32a150bf/0_0_5033_3369/master/5033.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715b3b2e144fe2bb15a47900c48e39ca32a150bf/0_0_5033_3369/master/5033.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715b3b2e144fe2bb15a47900c48e39ca32a150bf/0_0_5033_3369/master/5033.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715b3b2e144fe2bb15a47900c48e39ca32a150bf/0_0_5033_3369/master/5033.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Oleksandr Usyk lands the knockout blow on Daniel Dubois\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715b3b2e144fe2bb15a47900c48e39ca32a150bf/0_0_5033_3369/master/5033.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"297.8750248360819\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Oleksandr Usyk lands the knockout blow on Daniel Dubois.</span> Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>In the second round, sweat rolled down Dubois’ back as Usyk ducked under a scything right and snapped back his rival’s head with a beautiful straight left.

The unbeaten heavyweight champion walks slowly to the ring to a haunting version of Ave Maria by Tommee Profitt and Stanaj. He’s wearing a silver hooded robe and looks all business. Nothing new there. He makes the final approach to Браття by Василь Жадан, one of his more familiar ringwalk songs. The lights have gone down and Daniel Dubois is making his ring entrance. A half-dozen stage pyrotechnicians are doing their thing on stage to a Chase & Status banger. And now here’s Dubois, making the long way to the ring wearing a sleeveless black shirt with black shorts. He looks calm and composed, making his final approach as Dennis Brown’s Want To Be No General blasts from the stadium sound system.  Continue reading...",

Compubox’s punch statistics bear out a somewhat even fight: Usyk has landed 28 of 67 power shots (42%) compared to 22 of 67 for Dubois (33%).</p><p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 10-9 Dubois (Usyk 39-37 Dubois)</strong></p><figure id=\"661d4eab-b388-441d-8c81-3a77dc056b15\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-7\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b92c2cf0ac02a632538320d2bc5a3639947e85/0_0_2448_1565/master/2448.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b92c2cf0ac02a632538320d2bc5a3639947e85/0_0_2448_1565/master/2448.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b92c2cf0ac02a632538320d2bc5a3639947e85/0_0_2448_1565/master/2448.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b92c2cf0ac02a632538320d2bc5a3639947e85/0_0_2448_1565/master/2448.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Daniel Dubois takes a punch from Usyk.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b92c2cf0ac02a632538320d2bc5a3639947e85/0_0_2448_1565/master/2448.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\" height=\"297.27328431372547\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Daniel Dubois takes a punch from Usyk.</span> Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></article><article id=\"block-687c0f0d8f082b80ee738729\"><header></header><p><strong>Round 3</strong></p><p>Dubois rebounded nicely at the start of the third.

Ninety thousand fans are expected tonight, which is 6,000 less than last September when Daniel Dubois shocked Anthony Joshua and many in British boxing by crushing his older rival. But it’s still an impressive crowd as Dubois lacks the kind of vast following Joshua and Tyson Fury have built up over the last dozen years.</p>\n <p>The main undercard fight between Lawrence Okolie, campaigning as a heavyweight now, and the South African Kevin Lerena is approaching the later rounds. Okolie can be a destructive puncher and Lerena knocked down Dubois multiple times during their slu-fest in 2022. But this scrap is a more typical Okokie bout – low on thrills and high on tedium. At the moment there is a low hum around Wembley which only breaks out into something more enthusiastic when the bell rings for the end of another round and one of the usual old fight-night ditties is cranked up.</p>\n <p>In contrast to Okolie and Lerena, Jake Paul caught the attention of the crowd who responded with deep and sustained booing when he arrived 30 minutes ago with his fiancée, the Dutch speed skating star Jutta Leerdam. But we’re all really just waiting for the lights to dim and Usyk and Dubois to make their ring walks. The atmosphere then, unlike now, will be electric …</p>\n</blockquote><figure id=\"626a122c-0dd1-4c74-8750-c1df82900fe3\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-15\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26bc89bbbda9c8fec6390c266e5276e5c65875f/0_0_3607_2368/master/3607.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26bc89bbbda9c8fec6390c266e5276e5c65875f/0_0_3607_2368/master/3607.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26bc89bbbda9c8fec6390c266e5276e5c65875f/0_0_3607_2368/master/3607.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26bc89bbbda9c8fec6390c266e5276e5c65875f/0_0_3607_2368/master/3607.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Lawrence Okolie punches Kevin Lerena during the final undercard bout at Wembley.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26bc89bbbda9c8fec6390c266e5276e5c65875f/0_0_3607_2368/master/3607.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\" height=\"305.27308012198506\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Lawrence Okolie punches Kevin Lerena during the final undercard bout at Wembley.</span> Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></article><article id=\"block-687bffe18f082b80ee7386c8\"><header></header><p><strong>Also here at Wembley is Hamzah Sheeraz, the rising British star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/13/hamzah-sheeraz-knockout-berlanga-stevenson-zepeda-fight-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">fresh off his career-best win</a> last Saturday in New York.</strong> Fighting in the main event of a Ring Magazine card at Louis Armstrong Stadium – the first boxing show ever held at the US Open tennis venue – the 26-year-old from Ilford dropped Edgar Berlanga twice in the fourth round before finishing him just 17 seconds into the fifth.

preliminary of the evening, a scheduled 12-round heavyweight bout</strong>. Before that, Daniel Lapin extended his unbeaten run to 12-0 with a mostly forgettable points win over Lewis Edmondson in a 10-round light heavyweight scrap. The Ukrainian southpaw edged it on two of the three scorecards, 96–94, while the third judge had it even at 95–95, a reflection of a fight short on clean action and high on clinches.</p><p>Edmondson, coming off two strong wins including a breakout performance against Dan Azeez, struggled to find rhythm against the awkward 6ft 6in Lapin. Both men were guilty of excessive holding, and referee Marcus McDonnell repeatedly intervened to separate them and issue warnings. Lapin landed occasional left hands, while Edmondson responded with sporadic right hooks, but neither fighter was able to impose their will. The contest deteriorated into a maul by the later rounds, drawing ironic cheers from the crowd. In the end, Lapin’s slightly sharper work down the stretch proved just enough.</p><figure id=\"a2ed9e49-1bb1-499f-b494-668a104054cc\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-21\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ed1a25efe27636ed0b86a5913f263011410b37/0_0_5857_3905/master/5857.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ed1a25efe27636ed0b86a5913f263011410b37/0_0_5857_3905/master/5857.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ed1a25efe27636ed0b86a5913f263011410b37/0_0_5857_3905/master/5857.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ed1a25efe27636ed0b86a5913f263011410b37/0_0_5857_3905/master/5857.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Daniel Lapin was nearly sent over the top rope twice during the eighth round of Saturday's fight with Lewis Edmondson.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ed1a25efe27636ed0b86a5913f263011410b37/0_0_5857_3905/master/5857.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\" height=\"310.02646406009904\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Daniel Lapin was nearly sent over the top rope twice during the eighth round of Saturday’s fight with Lewis Edmondson.</span> Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></article><article id=\"block-687a4dd38f0826202a135882\"><header><h2>Preamble</h2></header><p><strong>The stakes could hardly be higher.</strong> On Saturday night at Wembley Stadium, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/oleksandr-usyk\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Oleksandr Usyk</a> and Daniel Dubois will square off once again, this time with every major heavyweight title on the line and a crowd of 90,000 watching from the stands.</p><p>It’s been nearly two years since their first encounter in Wroclaw, where Usyk weathered a contentious low blow and stopped Dubois in the ninth round. That bout ended with more questions than answers. Was Dubois denied a fair shot by referee Luis Pabon’s ruling? Or did Usyk simply prove, as he has time and again, that he’s one of the sport’s most complete fighters?</p><p>Since then, the Ukrainian southpaw has only strengthened his case. Back-to-back wins over Tyson Fury in Saudi Arabia made him the first undisputed world heavyweight champion in nearly a quarter-century. He briefly relinquished his IBF title to pursue a rematch with Fury – a belt that eventually made its way to Dubois – but on Saturday he has the chance to collect it once again and become a two-time undisputed champion.</p><p>Usyk has made a habit of dismantling British heavyweights, from Anthony Joshua to Derek Chisora to Fury, and arrives in London unbeaten as a pro, a perfect 23-0 with 14 wins coming inside the distance. He’s heavier than ever, but still moves with the grace of a former cruiserweight king and Olympic gold medallist.</p><figure id=\"4acefa16-a848-48a7-b823-bbcd2ce0e95e\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-22\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e4b45e550ad88eebd9f48bdd73c0d3a850bf58/0_0_4506_3004/master/4506.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e4b45e550ad88eebd9f48bdd73c0d3a850bf58/0_0_4506_3004/master/4506.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e4b45e550ad88eebd9f48bdd73c0d3a850bf58/0_0_4506_3004/master/4506.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e4b45e550ad88eebd9f48bdd73c0d3a850bf58/0_0_4506_3004/master/4506.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Usyk and Dubois look on at yesterday’s weigh-in.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e4b45e550ad88eebd9f48bdd73c0d3a850bf58/0_0_4506_3004/master/4506.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\" height=\"310\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Usyk and Dubois look on at yesterday’s weigh-in.</span> Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Dubois, however, insists this time will be different. The 27-year-old Londoner is riding high off three straight knockout wins, capped by a stunning stoppage of Joshua last September at this very stadium. He’s been rebuilt, rededicated and restructured under the ever-watchful eye of his father, Stan Dubois, who remains the architect of his career.</p><p>Still, questions linger. Can Dubois cope with Usyk’s jab and angles? Can he close the distance without getting picked apart? Or will Saturday mark yet another masterclass from the man who continues to outwit and outfight the best of Britain?</p><p>Lennox Lewis remains the last British man to unify the heavyweight division. If Dubois can spring the upset, he’ll do what Fury and Joshua could not and join Lewis in the history books.</p><p>The main event ringwalks are expected around 9.45pm local time.

It was a blatant, cynical foul and frankly bizarre behaviour from the 33-year-old Hendrich, one of the most experienced players on the pitch. Grace Geyoro duly stepped up and did what scarcely anybody has been able to do in this tournament so far and converted her penalty. Berger got a hand to Geyoro’s spot-kick but could not keep it out and the midfielder became France’s all-time top scorer at Women’s European Championships.</p><p>For the remainder of the first half, Germany defied their numerical disadvantage with a brave performance of counterattacking football and they equalised when Sjoeke Nüsken darted to the near post, unmarked, to meet Klara Bühl’s corner and loop an excellent header into the far corner.</p><p>France thought they had scored an outstanding team goal before half-time, when Delphine Cascarino’s instinctive backheel into the net rounded off a flowing move, but Cascarino had been in an offside position. Another offside flag decision, confirmed by the video assistant referee, also ruled out a French “goal” early in the second half, when Geyoro tucked in on the rebound from Berger’s close-range save from Marie-Antoinette Katoto, but Maëlle Lakrar was offside and deemed to have interfered with play, much to the frustration of France and Geyoro, who had run to celebrate with her jubilant teammates next to the substitutes bench.</p><figure id=\"ea6ab20d-2ae8-4e27-9e15-db631dffbf0d\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Sjoeke Nüsken of Germany celebrates her equaliser\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8242c48e7429c26a5d37046653539293f97d062/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Sjoeke Nüsken of Germany celebrates her equaliser after her side had already been reduced to 10 players.</span> Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Germany were doing an excellent job of stifling their opponents with a valiant defensive display and then – suddenly – at the other end, they were awarded a penalty when Selma Bacha clumsily fouled the superb Jule Brand.

She was magnificent again in the shootout, making two saves – including the decisive sudden-death strike from Alice Sombath – to complete a stunning result.

The teams also met in the semi-finals of the Euros three years ago in Milton Keynes, when the Germans emerged victorious after a talismanic performance from their now-retired striker Alexandra Popp, but this was supposedly a new France, a fresher France, and more technically impressive France team and one which had enjoyed three wins out of three to finish top of Group D, scoring 11 group-stage goals in the process. Yet they could not break this stubborn Germany defence down and they will surely see this as the greatest of all their many missed opportunities down the years.</p></div></div>"

He has driven in 14 runs in his last 13 games, and he is facing Braves starting pitcher Joey Wentz, who is making his first start since 2023. Wentz was added to Atlanta's roster earlier this week to assist the depleted rotation. This is a brutal matchup for Wentz in his first start in two years, and SportsLine's model projects 3.06 total bases for Judge, which can be wagered on at <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored mtech\">BetMGM.</a></p><h2>Shota Imanaga, Cubs, Under 2.5 earned runs allowed (-120)  </h2><p>Chicago is trying to extend its winning streak to four games, and it has the perfect pitcher on the mound to make that happen. Imanaga, who is 6-3 with a 2.65 ERA, has been outstanding since returning from the injured list. He is 3-1 with a 2.31 ERA in four starts since returning, allowing just one run in seven innings against the Yankees in his most recent outing. Imanaga allowed just one run in 6.1 innings in his lone start against Boston, which came last season. SportsLine's model has Imanaga finishing with 1.9 earned runs allowed, and this MLB prop can be <a href=\"https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/acq-bet-and-get?wpcid=399151&amp;wpsrc=3100&amp;wpcn=119&amp;wpscn=CBS&amp;wpcrn=Sports&amp;wpscid=xx&amp;wpcrid=xx&amp;pt_sessionId=mcjflxzi2ql27_c8921\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">played at DraftKings</a> by using the latest&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings promo code</a></span>.</p><h2>Christian Yelich, Brewers, Over 0.5 RBIs (+195)</h2><p>The Brewers are on a roll heading into their game against the Dodgers on Saturday night, and Yelich has been a big reason for their success. He had a single against Los Angeles on Friday to extend his on-base streak to 25 games. Yelich has a team-high 65 RBIs in 92 games, hinting at some immediate value at this price. Once Milwaukee's winning streak is accounted for, this bet looks even better. The model has him finishing with 0.7 RBIs on Saturday to provide value at +195 at BetMGM.&nbsp;</p><h2>Want more MLB player prop picks for Saturday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's MLB picks for some popular player props on Saturday.

Even then, there could be quite a few rookie holdouts.&nbsp;</p><p>A total of 257 players were selected in the 2025 <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>, but 31 players remained unsigned going into Thursday. The problem for most teams is they haven't been able to get their second-round pick under contract. Of the 32 players selected in that round, only three had signed their rookie deal heading into Thursday morning. However, the floodgates opened over the past three days with 22 signing their rookie deals over that span.&nbsp;</p><p>As things stand, eight players remain unsigned, which means eight players could still hold out.&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, let's take a round-by-round look at the unsigned players and whether each player might be able to get a deal done before their team starts training camp.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Unsigned first-round picks (1)</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Bengals rookie report date:</strong>&nbsp;July 19</li></ul><p>By now, you've probably heard about all the drama here. Things are getting contentious between <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28923420/shemar-stewart/\">Shemar Stewart</a> and the Bengals. The team threw a curveball in their contract negotiations with him by adding new&nbsp;<em>language</em>&nbsp;to his deal that the Bengals didn't use with their past two first-round picks. Stewart doesn't want the language in there, the Bengals do, and now, the two sides are in a stalemate. Stewart skipped all of OTAs and although he showed up, he didn't practice at mandatory minicamp. If we don't see one side blink soon, it's pretty much a guarantee that Stewart will hold out.&nbsp;</p><p>For the second straight year, there are 31 first-round draft picks signed by July 16, and for the second-straight year, the Bengals are the one team that has yet to get their first-rounder under contract.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-breaking-down-exactly-why-bengals-shemar-stewart-remains-only-unsigned-2025-first-round-pick/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Agent's Take: Breaking down exactly why Bengals' Shemar Stewart remains only unsigned 2025 first-round pick</p>\n                <p>\n                    Joel Corry                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Agent's Take: Breaking down exactly why Bengals' Shemar Stewart remains only unsigned 2025 first-round pick\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/16/077ab4f4-a89d-49a3-bc1d-443c0be8dd04/thumbnail/270x152/5db3d49ed8f236181adc2e387dee4f5d/shemar-stewart.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Unsigned second-round picks (7)</h2><p><strong>36th:</strong>&nbsp;RB&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28878286/quinshon-judkins/\">Quinshon Judkins</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a>&nbsp;(Rookie report date: July 18)<br><strong>47th:</strong>&nbsp;CB&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1906884/will-johnson/\">Will Johnson</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a>&nbsp;(Rookie report date: July 22)<br><strong>48th:</strong>&nbsp;OT&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26545232/aireontae-ersery/\">Aireontae Ersery</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a>&nbsp;(Rookie report date: July 22)<br><strong>51st:</strong>&nbsp; LB&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28921128/nic-scourton/\">Nic Scourton</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a>&nbsp;(Rookie report date: July 21)<br><strong>52nd:</strong>&nbsp; LB&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26723538/oluwafemi-oladejo/\">Oluwafemi Oladejo</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Titans</a>&nbsp;(Rookie report date: July 22)<br><strong>53rd:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;CB&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28924605/benjamin-morrison/\">Benjamin Morrison</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a>&nbsp;(Rookie report date: July 21)<br><strong>64th:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26698125/andrew-mukuba/\">Andrew Mukuba</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a>&nbsp;(Rookie report date: July 22)</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Signed second-round picks (25)</h2><p><strong>33rd:&nbsp;</strong>LB Carson Schwesinger, Browns<strong><br>34th:&nbsp;</strong>WR Jayden Higgins, Texans<br><strong>35th:</strong>&nbsp;S&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28903245/nick-emmanwori/\">Nick Emmanwori</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a>&nbsp;<br><strong>37th:</strong> G Jonah Savaiinaea, Miami Dolphins&nbsp;<br><strong>38th: </strong>RB TreVeyon Henderson, New England Patriots&nbsp;<br><strong>39th:</strong> WR Luther Burden III, Bears&nbsp;<br><strong>40th:</strong>&nbsp;QB&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964064/tyler-shough/\">Tyler Shough</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">Saints</a>&nbsp;<br><strong>41st:</strong>&nbsp;DT&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26723652/t-j-sanders/\">T.J.

Former <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> agent Joel Corry answered this question last month, and it seems like a good time to go over it again. Essentially, the hold up has to do with contract guarantees. The Texans decided to make history with the contract they gave <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26708551/jayden-higgins/\">Jayden Higgins</a>, and that decision threw a wrench into the entire second round.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Texans make history with Jayden Higgins' contract.</strong>&nbsp;Every player selected in the first round gets a fully guaranteed rookie contract, but that's not the case with players taken in the second round. Well, it wasn't until this year. When Higgins signed his deal on May 8, he became the&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2025-nfl-draft-this-second-round-pick-just-signed-a-historic-rookie-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">first second-round pick in NFL history to get a fully guaranteed rookie deal</a></span>, and he wasn't even the first pick of the second round. He was the second pick of the round at 34th overall.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Browns hand out the same deal.&nbsp;</strong>Higgins' deal with the Texans put the Browns in a spot where they had to give a fully guaranteed contract to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26724333/carson-schwesinger/\">Carson Schwesinger</a>, who was the first pick in the second round (33rd overall). The linebacker ended up getting a fully guaranteed deal, and in what was probably not a coincidence,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/browns-sign-two-2025-draft-picks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">he got it one day after</a>&nbsp;Higgins officially signed his contract. In 2024, the first pick of the second round (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26717289/keon-coleman/\">Keon Coleman</a>) only got 95.7% of his contract guaranteed, but Schwesinger got 100%.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Savaiinaea, Burden makes history:</strong>&nbsp;Dolphins guard Jonah Savaiinaea and Bears wide receiver Luther Burden III were the first players at their draft positions to receive fully-guaranteed contracts.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Tyler Shough makes things complicated:&nbsp;</strong>The Saints quarterback was taken with the 40th overall pick, and he wanted a fully guaranteed deal since he's likely going to be the team's starting quarterback this year. This started a domino effect of second-round picks who, like Shough, may also received fully guaranteed deals, specifically for the players taken between the 35th and 39th picks. One exception will likely be Browns running back Quinshon Judkins, the 36th overall pick, who was&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-rookie-rb-quinshon-judkins-arrested-faces-battery-charge-after-alleged-domestic-violence-incident/\" target=\"_blank\">arrested on July 12</a></span>&nbsp;on a troubling domestic violence charge. Judkins could face a suspension from the NFL and didn't report for training camp with the rest of the Browns' rookies on Friday.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Shough did reportedly <a href=\"https://x.com/AdamSchefter/status/1946620021847032147\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">get his coveted, fully guaranteed deal</a> on Saturday, which includes a roster bonus structure not featured in any first-round deals. That will allow Shough to receive the majority of his compensation each year during the first week of training camp.</p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

They marked the occasion with a big No. 5 on the Home Run Apple in center field.</p>\n<p>\"I never accomplished my goal of bringing a World Series back to Queens,  but I promise you I gave it everything I had and wanted it just as  badly as you did,\" Wright said during the ceremony while flanked by his family, teammates, coaches, and Mets legends. \"... That night [of my final game], I fully realized the extent of the relationship I had  developed with the city of New York, and in particular this Mets  fanbase.\"  </p>\n<p>Wright, 42, was the No. 38 overall pick in the 2001 draft and spent his entire professional career with the Mets. Over his 14 years in Queens, Wright authored a  batting line of .296/.376/.491 (133 OPS+) with 242 home runs; 390  doubles; 196 stolen bases; and 1,777 hits. Along the way, he amassed  seven All-Star selections, two Gold Gloves, two Silver Sluggers, and  four top-10 finishes in the National League MVP vote. Wright's career  WAR of 49.2 ranks second all-time in Mets franchise history -- behind  leader Tom Seaver and just ahead of Dwight Gooden.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Absent so many  injuries, Wright would probably be headed for the Hall of Fame. However, a  series of back, neck, and shoulder injuries cut his career short, and  ate into the late-career value he was able to muster. Still and yet,  Wright holds Mets franchise records for walks, hits, doubles, RBI, and  runs scored, among other things. He played his final game in September 2018.</p><p>Since taking control of the Mets in November 2020, owner Steve Cohen has  embraced the club's history and honored several of the team's all-time  greats. Gooden (No. 16), Keith Hernandez (No. 17), Darryl Strawberry (No. 18), Jerry Koosman (No.  36), and Willie Mays (No. 24), and now Wright (No. 5) have all had  their numbers retired since Cohen purchased the team.</p>\n        \n\n<p>No. 5 is the 11th retired number in Mets history, joining No. 14   (Gi Hodges), No. 16 (Gooden), No. 17 (Hernandez), No. 18 (Strawberry), No. 24 (Mays), No. 31   (Mike Piazza), No. 36 (Koosman), No. 37 (Casey Stengel), No. 41  (Seaver), and the universally retired No. 42 (Jackson Robinson).</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Two years later at Augusta, by one. Both times he left with the Green Jacket.</p><p>In May, the American parlayed a three-stoke lead into a six-shot win in the US PGA.</p><p>And now at Royal Portrush in this year's Open Championship, Scheffler has cleaved open an advantage of four shots after 54 holes following a display of understated authority in the hazy Northern Irish sunshine.</p><p>The 29-year-old's dominance has looked increasingly unassailable as the past couple of days have unfolded on the Antrim coast.</p><p>The unheralded Li Haotang of China is his nearest challenger. England's Matt Fitzpatrick is one further back. Rory McIlroy is six behind. </p><p>So is the third leg of a career Grand Slam now inevitable or can someone, somehow, deny Scheffler his fourth major and first outside the United States?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"Is-Scheffler-next-to-join-elite-club-\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">Is Scheffler next to join elite club? </span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Fitzpatrick had suggested after the second round that Scheffler - as world number one - would carry the burden of expectation around the links over this weekend.</p><p>But if he felt any pressure, he didn't show it in a serene round of 67. </p><p>Scheffler completed his day's work without a blemish on the card, an eagle and two birdies perfectly timed to ease himself clear of his rivals at just the right moments.</p><p>Now he is 18 holes away from becoming just the fourth player to win a Masters, US PGA Championship and Open before the age of 30 – after Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.</p><p>And should he do so, he would also become only the second player to win the Claret Jug while topping the world rankings, after Woods, who did it three times.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Not bad for someone who started his week in Northern Ireland by saying professional golf was \"not a fulfilling life\" and questioned \"the point\" of zealously pursuing victories.</p><p>And while he might not wring the same satisfaction from it as some, he could be three-quarters of a way to a career Grand Slam by the end of Sunday.</p><p>Given he's had four top-10s in the last eight US Opens, the chances are he'll join McIlroy in attaining membership of that elite club of six men some time soon.</p><p>\"I'm just trying to execute, not overthinking things,\" Scheffler said after his 67 on Saturday. \"I feel like I've been doing the right thing so far.</p><p>\"It would be nice [to win] but I'm not going to be thinking about that tonight.

my ball.</p><p>“It was so, so strange. I thought I was going to get a flier, and I looked up at my ball, and I could see it spinning up against the wind.”</p><p>It costs McIlroy a bogey five, and to add further insult he hears the roars signifying that Scottie Scheffler has just moved to 12 under par, seven shots clear of his score. But after the cruel comes the divine.</p><p>McIlroy is now on the 12th, about to caress a 56-foot eagle putt down the slope, right to left.

And it does. Only to slow down again. “It’s gotta go,” he says again.</p><p>The roars tell you what happens next. The ball disappears down the hole. And suddenly fans are jumping. Many throw their hands in the air. There are cries of “Rory! Rory!”. He is now seven under and beaming.</p><p>“The eagle on 12 was one of the coolest moments of my career – it’s one of the largest roars I’ve ever heard on a golf course,” he says later. “To get those shots back straight away was nice.”</p><p>The crowds surrounding McIlroy were so deep throughout the third round that many supporters were forced to rely on secondary senses to work out what was going on. The frequent eruptions from the galleries. The urgent cries of encouragement. And, especially in the first few holes, the smell that something mystical might be in the air.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-12\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id=\"32b30b13-854b-452d-810b-41d3bfd55198\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:13,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Air of inevitability blows in as Scottie Scheffler seizes control of the Open&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;32b30b13-854b-452d-810b-41d3bfd55198&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/19/air-of-inevitability-scottie-scheffler-seizes-control-of-the-open-golf-matt-fitzpatrick-li-haotong&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:6,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure><p>No wonder people were getting excited, especially after McIlroy made birdies on the 1st, 2nd and 4th. But then chances went begging. The 375-yard par-four 5th has been one of the easiest holes all week. But after a booming drive into the light rough, McIlroy was unable to get up and down for birdie. While on the par-five 7th, which had a scoring average of 4.53 on the day, another chance slipped by.</p><p>Still, another birdie at the 15th left the Northern Irishman signing for a 66 and tied for fourth on eight under. He is six shots behind Scheffler. But he is still hoping for a miracle.</p><p>“It was incredible,” he said of the atmosphere. “It was so much fun. I got off to the perfect start, three under [on the day] through 4. Felt like at the end of the front nine there, at least through 11, the par on 7 felt like a bogey, and then the bogey on 11.</p><p>“Then to play those last seven holes at three under I thought was a good effort. Yeah, I played well. I rode my luck at times, but it was an incredible atmosphere out there. I feel like I’ve at least given myself half a chance tomorrow.”</p><p>The same could not be said for the champion here six years ago, Shane Lowry, who shot a three-over-par 74 and then revealed he had been up most of the night with a stomach bug. “I’m not great,” he says. “I haven’t eaten today yet. I tried to get a protein drink down me after eight holes, and I felt like throwing up all over the place. Yeah, it’s been a tough day, but I’m not going to make excuses. I played poorly today and obviously had a bad finish.”</p><p>Lowry, who is now three over for the tournament, adds: “You get home late and have to dust yourself off and wake up at 2.30am with cramps in my stomach. “</p><p>McIlroy will hope for a smoother night before the mayhem begins again. “I started Oppenheimer last night,” he says. “Try to get through another hour of it tonight and maybe finish it tomorrow morning.”</p><p>He knows, though, that the way Scheffler is playing, it would take something out of a Hollywood movie to defeat him.</p></div></div>"

The Knicks could avoid the salary cap's second apron by signing Simmons and adding one rookie deal, according to Begley.</p><p>Simmons is a two-time All-Defensive selection and earned NBA Rookie of the Year honors in 2016, but his production has dwindled due to availability since the end of the 2020-21 campaign with the 76ers.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-free-agency-jonathan-kuminga-and-josh-giddey-among-notable-unsigned-players-remaining/live/\" target=\"_blank\">few notables left unsigned in free agency</a>, one can assume Simmons will be primarily viewed as a cost-effective depth option wherever he lands.

Scheffler jabbed back by collecting two shots of his own at the 7th but Fitzpatrick’s birdie at the same hole kept matters interesting. Scheffler reached 13 under par by picking up a shot at the 8th.</p><p>On the back nine there were two ridiculous par saves from Scheffler, at the 11th and 14th after finding deep foliage. The 16th is called Calamity for a reason; Scheffler made a mockery of its reputation courtesy of a birdie two. Fitzpatrick had erred at the short 13th, with his birdie two holes later offset by another mistake on the penultimate hole. The Yorkshireman closed on nine under after his level-par 71.</p><p>Scheffler has promised not to overthink his position. This seems his finest attribute, a mindset that does not move dependent on leaderboards. “I like being out here competing,” Scheffler said. “This is why we work so hard, to have opportunities like this and I’m excited for the challenge of tomorrow. Winning major championships is not an easy task and I’ve put myself in a good position.</p><p>“Going into tomorrow I’m going to step up there on the 1st tee and I’m going to be trying to get the ball in the fairway. When I get to the second shot I’m going to be trying to get that ball on the green. There’s not really too much else going on.” Simple, so blissfully simple. Try telling that to poor Matti Schmid, who shot 79.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-10\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id=\"888a9e8c-67d0-43cc-8b6b-d3b4f7affbb9\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaffd5f45736969793cd53ff36149127e9e3d7b3/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaffd5f45736969793cd53ff36149127e9e3d7b3/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaffd5f45736969793cd53ff36149127e9e3d7b3/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaffd5f45736969793cd53ff36149127e9e3d7b3/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaffd5f45736969793cd53ff36149127e9e3d7b3/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaffd5f45736969793cd53ff36149127e9e3d7b3/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Matt Fitzpatrick tees off on the7th hole during the third day of the Open at Royal Portrush\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaffd5f45736969793cd53ff36149127e9e3d7b3/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.8115234375\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Matt Fitzpatrick is leading the British challenge in third, five shots behind Scheffler, in spite of a bad day on the greens.</span> Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Fitzpatrick bemoaned problems on the greens. What was the issue with putts, Matt? “They just wouldn’t go in,” he replied with admirable candour. Fitzpatrick added: “Let’s be realistic, he’s five ahead. It’s not easy. But if you get off to a good start, then obviously put a bit of pressure on early doors and hope for the best ... You get three under through six, like some of the guys today, the 7th the par five and all of a sudden you’re kind of right back in it, you would hope. It’s clear what I have to do tomorrow.”</p><p>The tournament minus Scheffler is a decent one. Rory McIlroy reached eight under par with a dramatic 66, his lowest score of the week, before wonderful crowds. McIlroy’s homecoming has been already been everything he could have imagined. The Belfast boy has Chris Gotterup, Harris English and Tyrrell Hatton for scoring company.</p><p>On a day when chances were aplenty, the defending champion, Xander Schauffele, posted five under par to move to minus seven. Lee Westwood is out of winning contention at minus five but a back nine of 29 in glorious sunshine proved hugely enjoyable for the veteran. Westwood credited his wife and caddie, Helen, with triggering the run by providing the former world No 1 with a tuna sandwich on the 10th tee.</p><p>Bob MacIntyre, who is now eight shots adrift, summed up the hopelessness of it all for mere mortals. At the start of 2025, MacIntyre asked his caddie to assess how far behind the world’s top-ranked player he was in various statistics. Said bag man gave up the process after swiftly realising MacIntyre, then 16th in the rankings, was closer in all departments to No 2 than No 2 was to No 1. It is not the sea air dominating in Portrush. Instead, an air of inevitability.</p></div></div>"

Prosecutors say their business served as a hub for selling stolen goods obtained by international burglary rings targeting elite athletes' homes across the country.</p><p>According to investigators, these crews -- largely made up of foreign nationals from South America -- conducted thefts while athletes were away for road games. High-profile victims included NFL stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, Luka Doncic of the Los Angeles Lakers and Mike Conley Jr. of the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p>\n        \n\n<p>The multi-state probe resulted in six arrests, and although Nezhinskiy and Villar weren't formally charged with specific burglaries, phone data connects Nezhinskiy to an individual involved in the break-in at Burrow's residence.</p><p>Authorities recovered a vast array of suspected stolen property not only at the pawn shop but also from storage units linked to Nezhinskiy in New Jersey. The haul included luxury handbags, fine wine, sports collectibles, jewelry, artwork, and burglary tools like power drills and devices used to open safes.</p><p>Three men previously arrested in connection with a string of burglaries -- including one at Burrow's home -- were indicted by a federal grand jury in Cincinnati in February,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdoh/pr/3-men-believed-be-part-south-american-theft-group-indicted-federal-crimes-related\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio</a>.

The $2,878,900 the Nationals saved by signing Willits below slot will be spent on above-slot bonuses for later picks.</p><p>We ranked Willits, the son of former big leaguer and current college coach Reggie Willits, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/2025-mlb-draft-rankings-top-30-players-in-class-including-eli-willits-kade-anderson-ethan-holliday-more/\" target=\"_blank\">the No. 1 prospect leading into the draft</a></span>. Here's the write-up:</p>\n        \n\n<blockquote><p>Willits is considered to be the <em>other </em>prep shortstop with  big-league bloodlines near the top of the class, but I ranked him  aggressively in the spring and I see no reason to not do the same here.  Reggie's son is a surefire shortstop with all the necessary weaponry to  be a plus or better defender at maturation. He's also a promising  switch-hitter with strong bat-to-ball and zone-management skills (though  he seems unlikely to get to even average power). As an added bonus,  Willits won't celebrate his 18th birthday until December -- studies have  shown that such competence at a young age tends to bode well for the  player's long-term outlook. I don't know that he'll go No. 1, but I  would be shocked if he's available outside of the top five.</p></blockquote><p>Not surprisingly, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">we gave the Nationals an \"A\" for selecting the No. 1 player in the draft class with the No. 1 overall pick</a></span>. Willits joins a Washington pipeline that includes touted righty <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29295943/travis-sykora/\">Travis Sykora</a> and the recent call-up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26723699/brady-house/\">Brady House</a>. The Nationals surely hope he can move through the minors quickly and join <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117475/cj-abrams/\">CJ Abrams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835055/mackenzie-gore/\">MacKenzie Gore</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911704/james-wood/\">James Wood</a> in the big leagues soon.</p><p>\"Eli  was the top guy on our board,\" Nationals interim GM  Mike DeBartolo said after selecting Willits with the No. 1 pick. \"It's one of those nice things where the scouts and the  analysts see things exactly the same way, and saw him as the best hitter  in the draft, the best fielder in the draft, with just great makeup,  great work ethic, and all the intangibles.\"</p><p>Once he gets officially signed and situated, the 17-year-old Willits could make his professional debut in the Florida Complex League. That is rookie ball -- the lowest level of the minors. The FCL regular season runs through July 24. After that, Willits could head up to Low Class-A, where he would be one of the youngest players in the league.</p>\n        \n\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/nationals-fire-general-manager-mike-rizzo-and-manager-dave-martinez-amid-stalled-rebuild/\" target=\"_blank\">The Nationals fired longtime GM Mike Rizzo and manager Dave Martinez only days before the draft</a></span>.

The 32-year-old did not go yard against the Athletics on Friday, but he had a pair of hits and a walk in that contest. Severino is just 2-11 with a 5.16 ERA this season, and Ramirez has demonstrated success against him in previous meetings.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Ramirez is 6-19 off Severino in his career, but what stands out

WBA, WBO and WBC champion Oleksandr Usyk is set to rematch IBF champion Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium in London.</p><p>Usyk, then the WBO, WBA and IBF champion, won their August 2023 meeting by knockout in Round 9, though the win didn't come without some controversy. Dubois dropped Usyk with a shot to the body that was -- correctly -- ruled a low blow. Dubois and his team have insisted the referee's call was wrong and that they were thus cheated out of a pivotal moment in a huge fight.</p><p>The first win over Dubois set Usyk up to face then-WBC champ Tyson Fury to crown an undisputed champion.

Bradley is also the recipient of the 2023 Sam Taub award for Excellence in Broadcast Journalism.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p>Manny Pacquiao is coming out of retirement at age 46, just a month after his induction into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Boxing's only eight-division world champion will return to the ring at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on Saturday to face 30-year-old WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios (Amazon Prime Video PPV, PPV.com, 8 p.m. ET).</p><p>This will not be an easy fight for Pacquiao after a long layoff. Barrios won the WBC interim title in September 2023, made one successful defense in May 2024 and was elevated to full champion ahead of his fight against Abel Ramos on November's Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson undercard. Barrios, a tall fighter for the division at 6-foot, was knocked down by Ramos in Round 6 of an entertaining fight. Despite the scare, Barrios eked out a 12-round split decision.</p><p>Yet, Barrios holds one of the most impressive résumés among today's 147-pound champions. He owns a 2023 victory over Yordenis Ugas, who beat Pacquiao in August 2021, a loss that sent the Filipino legend into retirement. Barrios has also shared the ring with elite names such as Keith Thurman and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/38782247/gervonta-davis-biography-boxing-record-fights-more\">Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis</a>, both of whom handed him losses but provided him invaluable experience. Still, Barrios might be the weakest link among current welterweight champions, and that alone may explain Pacquiao's motivation for his return. This return isn't just about a paycheck; it's about adding to his legacy.</p><p>In July 2019, Pacquiao became the oldest welterweight champion ever, at 40, by defeating Thurman in a performance that defied Father Time. Now he wants to surpass Bernard Hopkins, one of boxing's all-time greats, as the oldest world champion in the sport's history. Hopkins defeated Jean Pascal in 2011 at age 46 for the WBC light heavyweight title, then outdid himself at 48 by beating Tavoris Cloud for the IBF belt. The second-oldest champion was George Foreman, who reclaimed the heavyweight title at 45 by knocking out Michael Moorer in 1994.</p><p>But there's a critical difference between what \"Big George\" did on his run, what Hopkins accomplished and what Pacquiao is attempting to do: Hopkins stayed active throughout his twilight years, and Foreman was active for 10 years during his return to the heavyweight crown. Pacquiao (62-8-39 KOs) has been out of the ring for over four years. There have been no tuneups, just a couple of exhibitions in 2022 and one in 2024. Jumping back into the fire with a hungry champion such as Barrios, who is naturally bigger, longer (with a 71-inch reach) and stronger, makes Pacquiao's attempt alarming and historic.</p><hr><h3>What it feels like to face Pacquiao</h3><p>I had the privilege of sharing the ring with Pacquiao on three occasions: 2012, 2014 and 2016. Each encounter brought a unique experience, driven by where he was in his career and where I was in mine. In 2012, Pacquiao was still at the height of his illustrious career. He hadn't lost in seven years and had just come off a remarkable run, defeating some of the sport's biggest names, icons such as Oscar De La Hoya, \"Sugar\" Shane Mosley, Miguel Cotto, Marco Antonio Barrera, Erik Morales and Antonio Margarito. Stepping into the ring with him for the first time, I imagined I was fighting a titan. Beyond the magnitude of the event, I found myself face to face with a charismatic and humble man whose soft-spoken voice and respectful demeanor draped over him like an invisible veil, contrasting to what stood across the ring from me on fight night.</p><p>The ring announcements felt shorter than in any other championship fight I'd had. My legs trembled uncontrollably as I bounced up and down to wake them. When I stopped bouncing, my legs would feel numb, as if they had been removed. Standing across from Pacquiao before the first bell rang, I could feel the weight of his presence. His aura was heavy, almost weakening me.</p><p>Pacquiao is, without question, the most outstanding athlete I've ever shared the ring with. Every movement he made was sharp, deliberate and unnervingly precise. His footwork and body feints kept me guessing and on edge, constantly tense, never knowing when his unorthodox combinations would deploy. His hand speed was deceptive and his sense of distance and his ability to change pace and rhythm made it all the more challenging.</p><p>What looked manageable in film studies felt overwhelming in real life. His first step into midrange came like lightning in an instant, and the moment he let his hands go, everything instantly became chaotic. I learned quickly that the crowd is his lifeline of energy. The more he gave it something to cheer about, the more ferocious he would become.</p><p>Pacquiao was far harder to hit than I had expected. His punching power was stunning; every connected shot sent a jolt through my head, and even the ones that missed sliced the air like bullets, whistling past my ears. When I did land something clean, he would clap his gloves together in defiance as if to say, \"That all you got?\" His stamina was unreal; his engine never stopped running. But what truly set him apart, though, was his tenacity and elite ring IQ. Try repeating a punch pattern twice, and you would find yourself eating a blazing fast counter from an unpredictable angle, his footwork in perfect sync with his hands, in short, explosive, choppy steps.</p><p>What made Pacquiao especially dangerous was his ability to sense when his opponent was fading. He could feel it, and that's when he would turn up the heat. His strength was highly unusual for his size, at roughly 5-foot-6.</p><p>Let's make this clear: Pacquiao's B, C and D games are better than most fighters' A game. Special fighters like him aren't manufactured. They're born. But 46 years of age is still 46.</p><hr><h3>How the fight could play out: Pacquiao's athleticism vs. Barrios' left hook</h3><p>Expect Pacquiao to turn this fight into a battle from the opening bell. He'll look to push the pace and close distance by disrupting Barrios' rhythm with feints, head movement, throwing combinations and using his sharp footwork. In training videos, Pacquiao still flashes glimpses of his legendary hand speed and footwork. He'll try to use that to explode forward with quick flurries and angle changes before Barrios can understand when to counter.</p><p>Pacquiao, the shorter man, knows he can't stay at long range. That's Barrios' comfort zone, where he can use his long jab, straight rights, looping shots and hooks with full power. To nullify that, Pacquiao must close the gap and attack Barrios' long torso. Those body shots are necessary to slow down Barrios' legs, drain his stamina and reduce his snap, timing and will throughout the fight.</p><p>Being a southpaw gives Pacquiao a tactical edge. Barrios hasn't faced many lefties in his career, and the last time he did, against Davis in 2021, he was peppered by left hands to the body and head and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/31717260/gervonta-davis-becomes-3-division-champion-tko-victory-mario-barrios\">was ultimately stopped</a>. I'm sure Pacquiao will try to mimic some of that success, using feints to mask his signature punch, the straight left hand, which he disguises with head movement and a step with his lead foot to the right, slipping outside and away from the peripheral vision of his opponent and firing straight down the middle with a sneaky left cross.</p><p>But this fight will not come without risks for Pacquiao. Once powered by his incredible athleticism, Pacquiao now will be left vulnerable by his explosive lunges and reaching. The older you get, the timing and balance don't always line up perfectly. And Barrios' counterpunching and game plan discipline will capitalize on those mistakes. He's not the kind of fighter who overreacts like Pacquiao; he likes to wait, time his opponent and punch with intent at the perfect distance, taking care of offense and defense simultaneously.</p><p>Barrios will likely stay composed early, content to let Pacquiao initiate the pace and expend energy. He'll start working behind a steady jab, using it to bust up Pacquiao's face and disrupt his rhythm. He'll pepper Pacquiao from the outside, and when Manny steps in with combinations, Barrios will look to time him with counters, particularly the straight right hand, a punch that has troubled the southpaw Pacquiao throughout his career.</p><p>Barrios' left hook could be a sneaky game changer, especially to the body. Remember, Pacquiao has struggled with calf cramps throughout his career, and if Barrios invests in body work early, it could take the strength, steam and snap out of Pacquiao's legs, eliminating his dynamic footwork and movement. As the fight gets deeper into the later rounds, Pacquiao's pace and pressure might begin to slow. His early energy likely will fade, and Barrios will have opportunities to take over the action, remaining behind the jab and continuing to control distance. Once he believes Pacquiao is fading, he should attack him with counters that might hurt Pacquiao. Barrios is very disciplined in the ring. He fights smart, never letting the moment overwhelm him, and he'll make small adjustments during the chaos Pacquiao loves to bring. He'll show maturity by sticking to the game plan: manage distance and punish Pacquiao for his mistakes.</p><hr><h3>Pacquiao in decline? Let's look at the numbers</h3><p>As fighters age and fade from their physical prime, there's often a noticeable decline, not just in activity levels but also in accuracy, reflexes and recovery. Older fighters might become more technical, taking fewer risks and relying on experience rather than volume or speed. But with that calculated caution comes reduced output and less physical ability to adapt under higher resistance.</p><p>In his fight against Ugas, Pacquiao didn't just look a step behind, but he looked like he had aged overnight. Ugas' composed counterpunching and sharp accuracy exposed the wear and tear of a long, restless career. Pacquiao's legendary footwork and timing, once razor-sharp, seemed obsolete. Ugas' reach, power, counterpunching and steady feet proved too much for the icon.</p><p>Ugas outlanded Pacquiao in total punches (151-130), jabs (50-42) and power punches (101-88). Ugas also connected on 59% of his power punches. For the first time, it became undeniable that Pacquiao had finally hit the wall that all great fighters eventually hit. Four years later, imagining any form of Pacquiao resurgence isn't easy. Time hasn't paused. Barrios is not only 16 years younger but also sharper and fresher. And he's undoubtedly experienced.</p><p>Barrios possesses many traits that troubled Pacquiao against Ugas, such as steady footwork, acute timing, an excellent jab and the energy that comes with youth. Don't let the video clips on social media fool you. Those Pacquiao shadowboxing sessions in parking lots, the blazing hand speed on the mitts or the thousands of crunches he grinds out look great. But looking great in the gym or against air doesn't equate to being fight-ready under live fire after lengthy inactivity.</p><p>Remember how sharp Tyson looked on the pads before his exhibition with Paul? It's one thing to look tremendous when no one's hitting back. It's an entirely different battle when your body begs for recovery, and it no longer comes as quickly. Reaction time slows and recovery stretches longer as we age. I know. Endurance, resilience and reflexes come naturally for the young. Yes, Pacquiao still has the heart of a warrior and will give whatever he has left in the tank, but Father Time is undefeated. Even his warrior spirit might not be enough to overcome this cherry-picked champion in the welterweight division.</p><hr><h3>Who wins?</h3><p>This won't be an easy fight for either Pacquiao or Barrios. Pacquiao will have his moments, maybe even rock Barrios with combinations, and his speed will win rounds. However, as the 12 rounds wear on and Pacquiao slows down, Barrios' reach, sharp counters and grit will show that Pacquiao is beatable at this stage of his career. Ultimately, Barrios wins a hard-fought unanimous decision, not by domination but by being what he needs to be on this night. He will beat a legend, but one far out of his prime.</p>\n</div></div>"

All scenarios were still on the table. Hope ran rampant around the property as the third round trundled on and player after player made birdie after birdie. Conditions were minimal. Scoring was ideal. It was Moving Day at the final major of the season, and fireworks were flying through the sky.</p><p>Low scores trickled into the clubhouse from the morning wave just as Rory McIlroy marched onto the first tee to begin his day's work. One birdie arrived on his scorecard with two more soon to follow -- three across his first four holes gave the local crowd something to roar about as their man was making his move, pulling within four of Scottie Scheffler, the overnight pace setter.</p><p>Justin Rose, Tyrrell Hatton and Matt Fitzpatrick joined the party. The English triumvirate appeared keen on breaking the 33-year drought their country possesses in this championship. Fitzpatrick touched the lead with a chip-in eagle on No. 2 and stayed in pole position until the speed racer that is Scheffler shifted into another gear.</p><p>Sauntering through the first third of his third round with six straight pars, Scheffler surged with an eagle on the par-5 7th and a birdie on the par-4 8th to double his overnight lead. Suddenly, it became difficult for his competitors to breathe. The world No. 1 was staring down at all of them, sucking the oxygen out of the championship. Worst of all? There was nothing anyone could do about it.</p>\n        \n\n<p>There were chances to come up for air as Scheffler showed signs of distress with a couple of wayward misses, but the windows were short and were quickly closed by the three-time major champion, who made sensational saves from the tall grass on Nos. 11 and 14.</p>\n<p>\"I had a really good par save on 11, really good par save on 14, and I did some good stuff,\" Scheffler said. \"I was pretty patient most of the day but felt like I was hitting it really nice. Just sometimes major championships it can be tough to make birdies, and today was one of those days where I just had to give myself some looks and was able to hole a few.\"</p><p>From there on, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/the-open-2025-leaderboard-scottie-scheffler-takes-commanding-lead-puts-one-hand-on-first-claret-jug/live/\" target=\"_blank\">Scheffler only tightened his stranglehold on the field</a>. For the third straight day, he made birdie on the par-3 16th nicknamed Calamity Corner. He watched as his peers piled up mistakes trying to do something -- anything -- to claw their way back into the forefront of this championship.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Only a few hours after hope ran through their veins and the minds of the onlookers, hopeless settled in. The man who won his first major championship by three, his second by four and his third by five had four strokes in his back pocket by the time he walked off the 18th green with a blemish-free 67 in the other, moving his score for the tournament to 14 under.</p><p>Another 54-hole lead is in Scheffler's possession, and if it goes anything like the nine that preceded it, he'll soon have his fourth major championship as well. He enters the final round as an overwhelming 2/15 favorite, per <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>.</p><h2>Rory McIlroy (-8)</h2><p>McIlroy was the first of those at 8 under to finish, which means he will play in the game just ahead of Scheffler on Sunday. Sporting a spot in the penultimate pair, the Northern Irishman will have a chance to apply some pressure on the overnight leader if he is able to get off to another fast start. The kicker is whether he can sustain it. McIlroy stalled ever so slightly in the middle of his round, but given the deficit and the front man, he does not have that luxury in the final round. <em>Odds: 22-1</em></p>\n        \n\n<p>\"I got off to the perfect start, 3 under through 4,\" McIlroy said. \"Felt like at the end of the front nine there, at least through 11, the par on 7 felt like a bogey, and then the bogey on 11. Then to play those last seven holes at 3 under I thought was a good effort. I played well. I rode my luck at times, but yeah, it was an incredible atmosphere out there. I feel like I've at least given myself half a chance tomorrow.\"</p>\n<h2>Matt Fitzpatrick (-9)</h2><p>Fitzpatrick found the bottom of the cup from just below the surface on No. 2 and found his name alongside that of Scheffler atop the leaderboard. The Englishman looked comfortable walking next to the man with the longest shadow for most of the day, but some loose swings and some short misses on the greens saw his name tumble five off the pace with 18 holes to go.</p><p>The 2022 U.S. Open champion must be kicking himself for some ill-timed missed putts as he has failed to connect on three attempts inside 5 feet across his last 20 holes going back to Friday afternoon. He will need to make just about everything on the greens tomorrow. <em>Odds: 28-1</em></p>\n        \n\n\n<h2>Haotong Li (-10)</h2><p>Li was within three strokes of Scheffler when he stepped onto the 18th tee and slumped to four back walked off the last green. A head-scratching decision to pull driver saw Li put his tee ball in the fairway bunker, causing him to card one final bogey. Still, he will enter the final round as the closest pursuer to Scheffler and the man who shares the last tee time of The Open. Li is supremely confident and ranks second in strokes gained approach and strokes gained tee to green this week. The long game has been stellar, and the short game will have to be as well if he plans to surprise the world by overcoming Scheffler and raising the Claret Jug. <em>Odds: 28-1</em></p><h2>Harris English (-8)</h2><p>English shot the lowest score in the final round of the PGA Championship and the third-lowest score in the final round of the Masters. He's a little closer to the lead this time around, but English has shown that he can catch fire across the final 18 holes of a major championship this season.The Georgia Bulldog checks in inside the top five in both strokes gained approach and strokes gained putting, but his driver has handcuffed him at times. He will need a big day with that club in particular if he is to have a chance. <em>Odds: 90-1</em></p><p>\"I'm happy with where I'm at,\" English said. \"I know it's going to take a special one tomorrow. But who knows, I've had some good Sunday finishes this year in the majors.\"</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Tyrrell Hatton (-8)</h2><p>An eagle from the middle of the fairway on No. 7 shot Hatton's name up the leaderboard, but the fiery Englishman was only able to add one more birdie onto his card from there on in. Hatton lamented that he has hit a ton of greens in regulation -- at least 14 in every round -- but has failed to get absolutely everything out of his game. He will have to squeeze all the juice out on Sunday given the deficit at hand, but the good news is he knows the chances will be there. If he is able to give himself a few more closer birdie looks and convert them more often, he has a round in the low 60s in the bag. <em>Odds: 50-1</em></p><p>\"Wow, going into tomorrow at the moment we're six shots behind, so it's a long way back,\" Hatton said. \"So far I'm in a decent position. I don't feel like I've played my best golf. Although I've hit a lot of greens, I haven't been that close to the hole. So it's quite hard to hole putts. I feel like I'm constantly just trying to get it up there close and walk off with par. That side of it has been a bit frustrating for me. Hopefully tomorrow I can play a bit better.\"</p>\n<h2>Chris Gotterup (-8)</h2><p>The Scottish Open winner has continued his scorcher this week, and he has an outside chance to become the first player since Phil Mickelson to win both the Scottish Open and The Open in consecutive weeks. Gotterup has gobbled up the par 5s through three rounds playing those nine holes in a 12-under par fashion. He will need to continue his scoring ways on those three holes on Sunday, but if he is to make up ground, he will have to do what he has failed to do thus far and that is score on the rest of the golf course. <em>Odds: 80-1</em></p>\n        \n\n<p>\"[Scheffler's] been the best player in the world for the past couple years. I fully expect him to go out and play a great round tomorrow,\" Gotterup said. \"I'm going to have to bring my best tomorrow, and I'm going to have to bring it anyways in terms of it being a final round in a major. Not just Scottie out there, there's a lot of great players in the mix.\"</p>\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

This weekend, there is a huge Bartelstein family wedding, as Mark's daughter and Josh sister, Courtney, is set to be married to her fiancé, Max.</p><p>\"Yeah, there's going to be some jokes when I get the mic,\" Josh Bartelstein told ESPN. \"My mom and grandmas are going to love it.\"</p><p>After the wedding, Mark Bartelstein is expected to finalize a contract for Beal to join the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"083a58a6-b849-3501-e67b-059290d12295\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a> in a two-year, $11 million deal, he told ESPN's Shams Charania, that completes a spectacular offseason for the team and ends a disastrous two years for the Suns and Beal.</p><hr><p><strong>THE END OF</strong> Beal's tenure in Phoenix came in three acts.</p><p>1) After new head coach Jordan Ott was hired in early June after a protracted search, he met with Beal and presented him a plan for how he could be used next season, sources said. Beal is coming off a season in which his usage rate was the lowest of his career, his role diminishing under former coach <a data-player-guid=\"45ce1f32-c3aa-5153-5f0f-1830dcce8f6b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1468/mike-budenholzer\">Mike Budenholzer</a>, who even took him out of the starting lineup for a six-week stretch.</p><p>Beal's stats still presented well; he averaged 17 points and shot nearly 50% overall and just under 40% from 3-point range. But playing on a maximum salary, at $50 million, and with the team woefully underachieving, that production didn't match the expectation, or the cost.</p><p>Ott, in his sales pitch to Beal, indicated the Suns had not totally given up on the concept of bringing him back next season. With two years and $113 million left on his contract and a no-trade clause -- which had totally undercut the Suns' ability to deal him last winter -- such a concept wasn't surprising.</p><p>Beal appreciated Ott's efforts, but after postseason meetings with Bartelstein assessing the situation, he had already decided that he needed to move on from Phoenix, if the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>\"We couldn't take the chance [of another lost year],\" Mark Bartelstein told ESPN. \"This decision was about basketball. Bradley wants to play in big games and in big moments.\"</p><p>2) On June 22, the Suns agreed to trade superstar <a data-player-guid=\"dc324fde-eee8-98e2-09ac-d31d8ad9909e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a> to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"78113ad4-1ac7-0c04-dada-388a6ff4e15e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets</a>.</p><p>The return included 23-year-old guard <a data-player-guid=\"e9d2d871-df56-3068-8d5f-e3fc27f49a96\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4437244/jalen-green\">Jalen Green</a>, whom the Suns determined to be a new cornerstone of their perimeter next to <a data-player-guid=\"493046d7-fa60-d8a1-1397-b9a6dca8dedf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a>.</p><p>Before taking the Rockets offer, the Suns had in-depth discussions with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"13f727cb-254d-b484-a337-93fcc0047add\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> about moving Durant and sought a package that included star center <a data-player-guid=\"78795dbf-3e02-934e-f796-d6a71375c9f5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032976/rudy-gobert\">Rudy Gobert</a>, guard <a data-player-guid=\"a74f6353-1678-ff6e-cab1-ed9cf5300189\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3934673/donte-divincenzo\">Donte DiVincenzo</a>, promising forward <a data-player-guid=\"37335dcf-ed28-c8e9-e8d8-1a6c7ff9dad6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432847/terrence-shannon-jr\">Terrence Shannon Jr</a>. and the 17th pick in this year's draft, sources told ESPN. Had that deal come to fruition, there was a place for Beal in the lineup, and the Suns might've made it a priority to keep him.</p><p>But Durant had made it known that the Wolves were not on his short list of preferred teams. And with just one season left on his contract, Durant had leverage. The talks faded. The deal the Suns made with Houston skewed young and, with Green, left Beal with a role that was undefined, at best.</p><p>Soon after, the Suns gave Beal and Bartelstein permission to speak to other teams about joining them via buyout, the best signal yet that the Beal era in Phoenix was ending. More than 20 teams showed interest, sources said. Eventually Beal met, via Zoom, with half a dozen teams about how he might fit with them.</p><p>3) On July 7, the Clippers traded starting shooting guard <a data-player-guid=\"4941d040-1812-cbb0-27bf-598cd624bc84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2595516/norman-powell\">Norman Powell</a> to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"81e3212c-30ef-9b1b-5edb-453b13ff265a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a> in a three-team deal that landed them a new starting power forward, <a data-player-guid=\"796e45a0-b375-dfdf-c240-b7550add4966\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3908845/john-collins\">John Collins</a> from the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77cea2fb-1388-b7c8-d171-2e72b3aecbfb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/utah/utah-jazz\">Utah Jazz</a>.</p><p>The Clippers were one of the teams that had already shown interest in Beal and were on his short list. When the Powell deal happened, talks accelerated, sources said. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and head coach Ty Lue, who as a native of Mexico, Missouri, has a long relationship with St. Louis native Beal, spoke to Beal about what the Clippers could offer.</p><p>But the key voice came from <a data-player-guid=\"35b0f455-b1df-0986-121d-27d2b6c18122\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a>, who lobbied the Clippers' front office to chase Beal and then reached out to him directly to make the sale, sources said.</p><p>Harden played in 79 games for the Clippers last season, logging the fifth-most minutes in the league at age 35. He made the All-Star team and the All-NBA squad, but also wanted to ease his burden going into next year and believed Beal could help.</p><p>The pitch was multifaceted, sources said. The Clippers finished the regular season 18-3 before going out in seven games against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c4aceb39-0eb9-a30b-1120-9cb5b12b677a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a> in the playoffs. The agonizing Game 4 loss, when <a data-player-guid=\"d6c22a9f-fbe3-1566-e175-c86137d057a5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064290/aaron-gordon\">Aaron Gordon</a> threw down a dunk a tenth of a second before the buzzer for the win, left the team bitter, but optimistic.</p><p>Harden sold Beal on the Clippers' depth and talked about how he would work well with Powell, who had a career-best season playing alongside Harden after replacing <a data-player-guid=\"d7e5e918-d53f-018e-9d15-f9005b2390ad\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george\">Paul George</a> in the starting lineup last season.</p><p>He outlined how the Clippers had embraced and helped him pivot in his career after disappointing runs in <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets\">Brooklyn</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ca1685ed-b799-53e4-7924-e58ea6eb8f3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\">Philadelphia</a> damaged his reputation. Beal, coming off a disappointing run in Phoenix that had similarly stunted his value across the league, could relate.</p><p>Harden even took the unusual step of speaking with Mark Bartelstein after all parties, including Harden's agents, approved the conversation. Recruiting a star peer is commonplace in the NBA; recruiting another agent to get on board is not.</p><p>\"No one wants to be released. There's heartache with that,\" Mark Bartelstein said. \"But Bradley wants to be in a position where no one remembers he got released, that they'll remember how he plays next season.\"</p><hr><p><strong>THE SUNS USED</strong> the waive-and-stretch provision to swallow the $99 million owed to Beal over the next five years, which means that money will sit on their cap, at $20 million a season, until the end of the decade.</p><p>It is a brutal position for the team to be in, especially because the Suns don't control their first-round draft pick through 2031. It's extending a mistake deep into the future, when it could haunt them in ways they can't even conceive of yet.</p><p>But the Suns pushed themselves to the decision for several reasons.</p><p>The first, and easier to understand, is money. Over the past two seasons, Suns owner Mat Ishbia had spent $620 million in salary and luxury taxes, and the team didn't win a single playoff game. Being expensive is one thing. Being expensive and losing is quite another, regardless of how deep-pocketed the owner might be.</p><p>Waiving Beal saves the Suns a whopping $175 million this season just in luxury tax, a figure so enormous that it alone could justify spreading the cap pain out over the next five years. When combined with the savings on salary just this season, the maneuver took more than $210 million off the team's balance sheet.</p><p>Though the Suns will have to eventually pay Beal the entire $99 million, the annual $20 million payment in the later years of the deal will likely represent a much smaller percentage of the salary cap than it does now. This sounds good in a PowerPoint presentation, but it might be tough to accept some 50 months from now.</p><p>Still, this move got the Suns out of the second and first aprons, freeing them to utilize all the roster-building tools that they would be locked out of because of their wild overspending. Between the second apron rules and Beal's no-trade clause, the Suns' inability to address their failed roster was crushing. What they did receive in buying Beal out was this flexibility, even though they are still limited by having traded so many draft picks over the past few seasons.</p><p>And there was the Green addition, who the Suns believe will pair well with Booker.</p><p>\"[We] brought in one of the rising stars in the NBA in Jalen,\" Suns general manager Brian Gregory said after the trade was finalized. \"His athleticism and natural ability are off the charts. Jalen has already proven his commitment to putting in the work that excellence requires, and we believe that his approach to the game will allow him to further unlock his incredible upside here in Phoenix.\"</p><p>Getting to the decision was one thing. Making the deal was another. The Suns needed Beal to leave at least $13.9 million from his remaining two seasons to make the buyout legal under league rules. The Suns were right up against the maximum 15% of the salary cap allocated to bought-out players and needed Beal's cooperation.</p><p>The Suns had hoped to get Beal to leave more money on the table than just the $13.9 million. Talks went back and forth and got heated, sources said. Ultimately, Beal left the least amount possible to make the waiver work, to the penny.</p><p>\"There were some intense conversations,\" Mark Bartelstein said.</p><p><strong>BEAL AGREED TO</strong> sign with Clippers for about $5.4 million this season, every penny they had left in their midlevel exception after giving <a data-player-guid=\"3496fbc1-fa88-c332-7f91-f015006e0c8b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez\">Brook Lopez</a> a two-year deal starting at $8.7 million earlier in July.</p><p>Beal will lose a little bit of money than what he had guaranteed, but with a player option that will allow him to become a free agent again next summer at age 33, he's hoping a productive year in Los Angeles will enable him to recoup it and more.</p><p>Beal's numbers last season felt underwhelming at his $50 million salary, but if he comes close to duplicating them for the Clippers, costing 90% less, it's an unmitigated success story.</p><p>When L.A. entered contract talks with Harden after the season, both sides understood the need to further add to the roster. Harden ultimately agreed on a new two-year deal for $81 million with a player option for next season.</p><p>Harden's $39 million salary this upcoming season, a $6 million raise from last year, left the full midlevel exception available for the Clippers to use. Then he helped recruit players such as Lopez and Beal into those salary slots.</p><p>In the end, the Clippers turned Powell and their midlevel exception into Lopez, Beal and Collins this summer, building the depth they sought. With Collins in the final year of his contract, at $27 million, and the Clippers holding team options on <a data-player-guid=\"db759921-c2d4-28de-f1eb-66f1c0aa708f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3037789/bogdan-bogdanovic\">Bogdan Bogdanovic</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"e83378ef-622a-a884-12bb-86482f9a84d2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3416/nicolas-batum\">Nico Batum</a> and Lopez, they are in position to have enough cap space to offer a maximum contract next summer, if they so choose.</p><p>Beal and Harden, both of whom have those opt-outs, are incentivized to have big seasons. <a data-player-guid=\"87ff907c-c68c-a82d-1215-37e05d0c62ef\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a> is coming off his first healthy summer in years and, per team president Lawrence Frank, kept doing full workouts into June after the playoff loss to prepare his body for a deep playoff run next season.</p><p>Best-laid plans have frequently turned into nightmares for the Clippers this decade.

For Ionescu, that was just a warmup.</p><p>In the final, Ionescu missed her first two shots and her last three, which led her to say she was \"pretty disappointed\" because she \"missed a few easy ones.\" Everyone else was amazed by Ionescu making 11 consecutive shots at one point, including the deep 3, reminiscent of her record score of 37 during the 2023 final.</p><p>Ionescu settled for a 30-point round, giving her two of the three times WNBA players have scored 30-plus in the 3-point contest since the current format was adopted in 2021. Quigley, with a round of 30 in the finals, was fittingly the other player to reach that mark.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/wnba/players/full/3058901.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"130\"></p><p><strong><a data-player-guid=\"42ac782c-1f52-80e6-59ee-eebe51e6c1ec\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3058901/allisha-gray\">Allisha Gray</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bceea196-4263-d338-17a7-9ae40f3aed3f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-dream\">Atlanta Dream</a><br>\nGrade:</strong> A-</p><p>Going last as the defending champ, Gray set up the anticipated showdown of the past two winners by making four shots and the money ball from each of the last three racks. That tied Ionescu's score of 25 in the opening round. Gray got on a similar roll from the left wing in the finals, going 5-for-5 after making the deep 3 from that side, but it was already too late to catch Ionescu. Gray missed her first four shots of the finals and went 0-of-5 from the top of the key. Gray's score of 22 points in the finals nonetheless matched the best round by anyone but her and Ionescu.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/wnba/players/full/3065570.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"130\"></p><p><strong><a data-player-guid=\"2e8112d2-f7f5-33dd-0ab1-7a41c4134037\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3065570/kelsey-plum\">Kelsey Plum</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fc3d2f98-2a3d-9ef8-4d5b-b8d5168d7737\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/la/los-angeles-sparks\">Los Angeles Sparks</a><br>\nGrade:</strong> B</p><p>The middle of Plum's round put her in the early lead. She made three from the top of the key, the right deep 3 and four of five from the right wing. Had Plum made her final shot, worth two points, she would have made things really interesting for the two finalists. Instead, Plum finished third behind the two previous champions.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/wnba/players/full/4433524.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"130\"></p><p><strong><a data-player-guid=\"40260700-49ec-36b3-8b20-339722b76b02\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4433524/sonia-citron\">Sonia Citron</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"39c302ad-d5df-e0d0-33e8-1cffebc5bc75\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/wsh/washington-mystics\">Washington Mystics</a><br>\nGrade:</strong> B-</p><p>The lone rookie in the field might have needed to move her money ball rack. Citron made four of her high-arching shots from the left wing and all five from the top of the key but went 1-of-5 from the right wing with double points for all shots. Simply flipping the two wings would have given Citron a couple more points and pushed her out of last place. For that spot, Citron's score was more than respectable.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/wnba/players/full/4398829.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"130\"></p><p><strong><a data-player-guid=\"a27d443a-9d18-a215-5e1d-d4090cd1358d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4398829/lexie-hull\">Lexie Hull</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bfef1bdd-c2d1-310d-dd9f-645b90575da9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-fever\">Indiana Fever</a><br>\nGrade:</strong> B-</p><p>The Fever's only player to compete Friday was a late replacement for teammate <a data-player-guid=\"5ec40e1c-3104-322e-b80f-f358ea26aad4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4433403/caitlin-clark\">Caitlin Clark</a>, who had to withdraw due to injury. Early on, it looked like Hull's shot -- reliant on a large vertical jump -- might not translate to the 3-point contest. She had just three points through the first two racks before making one of the deep 3s. Hull caught fire down the stretch, making eight of her last 10 shots -- including four of five from the money ball rack -- but it wasn't enough to reach the finals.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Skills challenge</h2><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/wnba/players/full/2529137.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"130\"></p><p><strong><a data-player-guid=\"c3d35267-fedd-d8d2-8c24-64ee7aa144ac\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2529137/natasha-cloud\">Natasha Cloud</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ad8ccde6-59b3-fbe6-2faf-a835fa224ca1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-liberty\">New York Liberty</a><br>\nGrade:</strong> A</p><p>I thought Cloud was out of the finals after she needed all three attempts on both 3-point shots, but she managed to race through the final pass and the hoop for a layup just ahead of Erica Wheeler's time of 37.5 seconds.

However, the pace of this year's summer is set to get far quicker than they've been in years, as The Monster Mile has awakened to interrupt the tranquility.</p><p>This weekend, NASCAR makes its annual trip to Dover Motor Speedway for the Autotrader Echopark Automotive 400, changing things up from its traditional spring and fall dates to a midsummer visit. It's the first time NASCAR raced at Dover in July since their very first visit to the one mile speedway, which came in 1969 when Richard Petty took the checkered flag. Years later, a summertime trip to Dover is sure to make for a unique challenge unlike any previous trips to the track, as the summer heat stands to make this track's concrete surface slick, greasy, and thirsty for the physical carnage it's known for.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nascar/news/ty-dillon-star-of-nascars-in-season-challenge-regaining-confidence-and-having-fun-again-as-cup-driver/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Ty Dillon, star of NASCAR's In-Season Challenge, regaining confidence and having fun again as Cup driver</p>\n                <p>\n                    Steven Taranto                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Ty Dillon, star of NASCAR's In-Season Challenge, regaining confidence and having fun again as Cup driver\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/17/1d0e1384-8484-4a5c-ad58-ab9ef53f8da4/thumbnail/270x152/5c4092c506dfce9d09cd75ed369e938a/gettyimages-2224390954.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Where to watch the NASCAR Cup Series at Dover</h2><p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, July 20, 2 p.m. ET<br><strong>Where:</strong> Dover Motor Speedway -- Dover, Del.<br><strong>TV: </strong>TNT<br><strong>Stream:</strong> fubo (<a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome?irmp=416484&amp;irad=356362\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">try for free</a>)</p><h2>Starting lineup</h2><p>Rain washed out practice and qualifying Saturday, forcing NASCAR to set the starting lineup per the sport's rule book.

Yeley</li></ol><h2>Storyline to watch</h2><p>Sunday's race in Dover features a major milestone for the reigning Cup Series champion, as Joey Logano makes his 600th career Cup start and claim a piece of NASCAR history as his own. In making his 600th start at 35 years, one month and 26 days old, Logano <a href=\"https://x.com/NASCARInsights/status/1946218789634285575\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">will break the NASCAR record for the youngest driver to ever reach 600 Cup starts</a>, which had been held for 52 years by Petty after he made his 600th start at Richmond at 35 years, seven months and 23 days old in 1973.</p><p>Dover is a somewhat fitting locale for Logano's milestone, as in 2008 it also served as the site of his debut at the national level in the Xfinity Series shortly after his 18th birthday. Logano made his first Cup start later that year before going full-time as a teenage phenom in 2009, but he is still looking for his first Cup win at Dover in what will be his 29th start at the speedway.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dover will serve as the semifinals of NASCAR's In-Season Challenge, where now just four drivers remain. No. 32 seed Ty Dillon continues his Cinderella run through the tournament and will be matched up with No. 12 seed John Hunter Nemechek, while No. 23 seed Tyler Reddick faces No. 6 seed Ty Gibbs on the other side of the bracket.</p>\n        \n\n<p>The highest finisher in each of the two matchups will move on to the final round in next weekend's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, where they will go head-to-head and race for the grand prize of a $1 million bonus.</p>\n<h2>NASCAR news of the week</h2><ul><li>23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports <a href=\"https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nascar/what-know-about-nascar-antitrust-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lost their charters</a> for at least the next two Cup Series races after their request for a preliminary injunction in their antitrust lawsuit against NASCAR was denied on Thursday. 23XI and Front Row sought a preliminary injunction to prevent NASCAR from revoking their charters and continue forcing the sport to recognize them as chartered teams, but a judge ruled that because neither team will be in danger of failing to qualify for the next two races or lose their drivers or sponsors, they are not subject to irreparable harm.<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nascar/news/nascar-issues-forceful-response-to-court-over-23xi-front-row-request-to-reclaim-charter-status\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">While the teams claim</a>&nbsp;that NASCAR signaled intentions to sell their charters to other entities, NASCAR claimed that it would not sell any charters before the court can rule on the plaintiffs' motion. NASCAR also claimed that the teams had \"manufactured evidence of harm\" when requesting a previous preliminary injunction.</p><p>While racing as open teams, 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports will not be eligible for the financial and competitive benefits earned by chartered teams, which includes a guaranteed starting spot in each Cup Series race. While only 37 cars are entered at Dover and less than 40 cars are expected to be entered in the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, 23XI and Front Row's teams would be in danger of missing the field in the event that more than 40 cars enter a future Cup Series race and they are not fast enough to qualify.</p></li><li>In other legal news, Legacy Motor Club <a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/legacy-motor-club-sues-tj-puchyr-for-underhanded-attempt-to-buy-rick-ware-racing/10742689/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sued former Spire Motorsports co-owner T.J. Puchyr</a>, claiming that Puchyr made an \"underhanded attempt\" to purchase Rick Ware Racing while Legacy M.C. was in a legal dispute with Rick Ware over the purchase of one of the team's charters. Legacy M.C. claims that Puchyr had been working with the team in an \"independent contractor agreement\" through his consulting firm, but was reported several weeks ago to have reached an agreement to purchase Rick Ware Racing.<p>Legacy M.C.'s lawsuit against Puchyr comes several days <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-cautions-rick-ware-racing-to-pump-brakes-on-looming-charter-sale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">after a hearing was conducted</a> in their lawsuit against Rick Ware Racing, in which a Charlotte, N.C. judge ruled that there could be \"really serious ramifications\" if Rick Ware Racing sold one of its charters despite informing the court it did not plan to do so. A previous judge in the case had decided not to issue an order to prevent RWR from selling or transferring their charters based on the idea that they would be static during legal proceedings.</p></li><li><a href=\"https://racer.com/2025/07/17/nascar-headed-for-san-diego-in-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">RACER reports</a> that NASCAR reached a deal to hold a street race in San Diego, Calif. next season, with an announcement to come as early as next week in a major development in the formation of the sport's 2026 schedule. In addition to a race in San Diego that would return NASCAR to the Southern California market, <a href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/07/16/nascar-evaluating-chicagoland-speedway-return/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sports Business Journal reports</a> that NASCAR has been evaluating a possible return to Chicagoland Speedway next year, a move which would put Chicagoland back on the schedule for the first time since 2019 and keep NASCAR in the Chicago market amid an uncertain future for the city's own street race.</li><li>Xfinity Series team Our Motorsports <a href=\"https://x.com/bobpockrass/status/1946243623940477114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced it will shut down</a> following Saturday's race in Dover after parting ways with driver Kris Wright. Wright brought sponsorship funding to the team through First National Bank, but his results were poor and he ranked 29th in points -- lowest of any driver to attempt every race this season -- following last Saturday in Sonoma.<p>Kaz Grala will drive the team's No. 5 Chevrolet in their final race before ceasing operations.</p></li></ul><h2>Pick to Win</h2><p><strong>Kyle Larson (+500) --</strong> Since the start of his Cup career in 2014, Dover has often been a place where Kyle Larson excelled to the point where it's hard to believe that he has just one victory there. Larson has eight top fives and 12 top 10s in 16 career Dover starts, with a staggering four runner-up finishes – including last year – taking some of the bite out of his history of performance there.</p><p>Larson seems due for his first Dover victory with Hendrick Motorsports (his win in 2019 came with Chip Ganassi Racing), and the odds are very good that it's coming: In four starts at Dover since joining HMS, Larson has run second twice and has also finished sixth.</p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div>\n\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    <ow-sidebar header-selector=\"#GlobalNav\" post-id=\"41b8fe15-22af-4156-9d3c-eb6f9d379008\" module-location=\"article header\" module-campaign=\"open web\">\n        \n    </ow-sidebar>\n    \n                        </main>\n\n                                            </div></div>"

His success rate of 32.1% over the first two days ranked him 150th in the original field of 156.</p><p>He found the first fairway on Saturday, though, and it set the tone for an early charge that sent thousands of already frenzied disciples into delirium.</p><p>A 30-foot birdie on the first was greeted with a thunderous cheer, reminiscent of a Sunday Tiger roar at Augusta. </p><p>A tap-in birdie on two and six-footer on the fourth were received with even louder bellows of encouragement with \"Rory, Rory, Rory\" echoing through the dunes. McIlroy had gone from seven behind Scheffler at the start of play to just four.</p><p>But then it fell flat.</p><p>A missed birdie putt from a dozen feet on the fifth and one from similar distance on the seventh killed the momentum.</p><p>His first real failure with the driver down the 11th led to a first bogey - after a bizarre incident in the rough where he unearthed a buried ball with his follow through after striking his own towards the green. </p><p>All hope lost? Not quite. </p><p>More whooping turned heads across the course as McIlroy drained a 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th.</p><p>\"It was loud and cool,\" was Schauffele's take on the cacophony of noise following McIlroy's every move. </p><p>\"I was on the 17th tee when I heard whatever happened. I assumed it was an eagle, some sort of hole-out. It was very loud, and he got a standing ovation walking down 13.</p><p>\"He looks like he's enjoying it. It looks like the fans are enjoying it, which is great for this event.\"</p><p>But while the fans celebrated, Scheffler was busy birdieing the eighth to move six clear on 13 under. </p><p>It was a stark reminder that while the focus of the majority was firmly on McIlroy, he was only one closer than he had been at the start of play.</p><p>Still McIlroy pushed. A wedge on 15 into three feet yielded another birdie. Cue more bedlam in the stands. </p><p>But scrambling pars, first from the ravine on the long par-three 16th, and then after a wild drive on 17, saw his round peter out. </p><p>Just one bogey in a 66 would, on most days, be raucously celebrated but at six back he has surely left himself too much to do on Sunday.</p></div></article></div>"

No transfer is ever without at least some risk; nothing is ever guaranteed.</p><p>Still, the early moves in the market are revealing, if not necessarily for what they may mean for how the title contenders may play next season, then at least for what they say about the state of those clubs and their perceived priorities.</p><p>Getting your transfer business done early is one of the supposed markers of a decisive side that knows its own mind, which is good news for the four teams likely to be Premier League contenders – and rather less good news for Manchester United, who have moved to sign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/matheus-cunha-signs-manchester-united-dream\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Matheus Cunha</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/18/manchester-united-agree-deal-bryan-mbeumo-brentford-initial-65m\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Bryan Mbeumo</a>, while struggling to offload any of the half dozen players who are surplus to requirements.</p><p>The best time to build, the ancient wisdom has it, is from a position of strength, and Liverpool have done that, bringing in a pair of full-backs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/20/florian-wirtz-liverpool-bayer-leverkusen-club-record-116m-deal\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">and Florian Wirtz</a> at a total cost of around £165m.

That would mean either Dominik Szoboszlai plays less or that he is used deeper at times to add creativity against opponents who sit in a low block.</p><p>Given Arne Slot’s lack of faith in Darwin Núñez, a move for a centre-forward was always likely.

Chicago is sending out <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29326548/shota-imanaga/\">Shota Imanaga</a> on the mound, and he's been excellent this season with a 6-3 record and 2.65 ERA.

The WNBA has implemented a couple new rules for this game, including four 4-point zones designed for shots from the logo. While Caitlin Clark is out for this contest with a groin injury, her <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Fever</a> teammates <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29101293/aliyah-boston/\">Aliyah Boston</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677896/kelsey-mitchell/\">Kelsey Mitchell</a> will have the full support of the hometown fans.</p><p>Max Meyer, though, thinks that there is good value in backing Angel Reese to win All-Star Game MVP at +3000. Reese has been on fire lately, and Meyer is banking on Reese playing hard in an exhibition game where other players may not take it as seriously. Reese had a double-double in last year's All-Star Game, and with a shortened shot clock (20 seconds compared to the usual 24) and more deep shot attempts with the new 4-point zone, Meyer thinks Reese can break the WNBA All-Star Game record by grabbing 20 rebounds in this contest.</p><p><strong>More WNBA picks</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/ufc-fight-night-odds-picks-seasoned-mma-analyst-reveals-selections-for-lewis-vs-teixeira-and-other-nashville-matchups-on-july-12/\" target=\"_blank\">WNBA experts Calvin Wetzel and Aaron Barzilai have their All-Star Game best bet</a>&nbsp;($)</li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/how-to-bet-on-the-wnba-all-star-game-2025-where-to-bet-top-betting-sites-draftkings-fanduel-betmgm-promos/\" target=\"_blank\">How to bet on the WNBA All-Star Game</a></span></li></ul><h2>UFC best bets today, where to watch</h2><h3>UFC 318: Holloway vs. Poirier 3</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong>&nbsp;10 p.m. (main card) | <strong>Location:</strong> New Orleans | <strong>TV:</strong>&nbsp;ESPN+</p><p><strong><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-318-odds-props-predictions-fight-card-holloway-vs-poirier-3-picks-from-proven-mma-expert/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine expert pick</a></span>:</strong>&nbsp;Francisco Prado (-130) over Nikolay Veretennikov (Daniel Vithlani)</p><p>Dustin Poirier will conclude a storied UFC career on Saturday night, as the former interim lightweight champion will have his final bout against familiar foe Max Holloway at UFC 318.

Expect to hear that on repeat in the coming months. There was plenty to pick over.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-frank-set-up\">How did Frank set up?</h2><p>The short answer was in a 4-2-3-1 formation, but Frank is all about flexibility and there were a number of takeaways, particularly in possession. He started with Mikey Moore on the left wing but the teenager was given the licence to drift inside to connect with the No 10, which at the outset was another youngster, Alfie Devine. This created the space for Destiny Udogie to push high up from left-back, with Spurs building in a back three. On the other wing, Brennan Johnson played high and wide. Of the central midfield pair, Rodrigo Bentancur sat and Pape Sarr pushed up at times. The approach with the ball was similar after the interval, although this time it was the right-winger, Mohammed Kudus – on his first appearance after signing from West Ham – who roamed inside, allowing the right-back, Djed Spence, to overlap. Out of possession, Spurs broadly pressed in a 4-4-2, with the No 10 squeezing high.</p><figure id=\"cdd15b59-510e-4a75-bdd6-1c3712730959\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61c6dda349c02bcf65715fa003df389584b8fe0/343_50_2756_2205/master/2756.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61c6dda349c02bcf65715fa003df389584b8fe0/343_50_2756_2205/master/2756.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61c6dda349c02bcf65715fa003df389584b8fe0/343_50_2756_2205/master/2756.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61c6dda349c02bcf65715fa003df389584b8fe0/343_50_2756_2205/master/2756.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61c6dda349c02bcf65715fa003df389584b8fe0/343_50_2756_2205/master/2756.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61c6dda349c02bcf65715fa003df389584b8fe0/343_50_2756_2205/master/2756.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Djed Spence (left) congratulates Will Lankshear for opening the scoring\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61c6dda349c02bcf65715fa003df389584b8fe0/343_50_2756_2205/master/2756.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"356.0322931785196\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Djed Spence (left) congratulates Will Lankshear for opening the scoring.</span> Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-was-notable-in-terms-of-personnel\">What was notable in terms of personnel?</h2><p>Frank brought a 26-man squad and there were notable absentees – above and beyond the injured Dejan Kulusevski and Radu Dragusin plus James Maddison, who is only part-training with the squad after an injury of his own. Archie Gray, Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel were given additional leave after their involvement in the European Under-21 Championship and did not travel, Frank preferring that they stayed at Hotspur Way to train in the morning. Richarlison did likewise. The striker was involved with Brazil up to the second week of June and he is taking care with his return in light of previous injury problems. As an aside, Richarlison is understood to be keen on staying at Spurs; only if something exceptional showed up would he consider leaving. Kota Takai, the new Japanese signing, was not in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/reading\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Reading</a>. He has a minor contact injury.</p><h2 id=\"any-sign-of-the-frank-set-piece-effect\">Any sign of the Frank set-piece effect?</h2><p>It was certainly striking to see Spurs practise corners and free-kicks on the pitch about 20 minutes before kick-off, with all the outfield starters defending the deliveries from the youngster George Abbott, who would be an unused substitute. Attacking them were members of Frank’s coaching staff. He enjoyed great rewards on set pieces at Brentford and the early signs here were positive, both goals coming after corners from Kudus. The taker in the first half had been Pedro Porro. The opener followed a header by Vuskovic for Lankshear to nod home from close range and the second came after Kudus crossed low for Vuskovic, Reading having withstood the first phase of the move. There were no long throws, albeit there were minimal opportunities for Spurs to try one.</p><figure id=\"66b0632a-4975-4b05-bc21-4b18b034a6f1\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c415dbdbcc8024ba9130b8b5d77825f63c4b09eb/298_200_3311_2214/master/3311.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c415dbdbcc8024ba9130b8b5d77825f63c4b09eb/298_200_3311_2214/master/3311.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c415dbdbcc8024ba9130b8b5d77825f63c4b09eb/298_200_3311_2214/master/3311.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c415dbdbcc8024ba9130b8b5d77825f63c4b09eb/298_200_3311_2214/master/3311.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c415dbdbcc8024ba9130b8b5d77825f63c4b09eb/298_200_3311_2214/master/3311.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c415dbdbcc8024ba9130b8b5d77825f63c4b09eb/298_200_3311_2214/master/3311.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Luka Vuskovic scores Spurs’ second goal\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c415dbdbcc8024ba9130b8b5d77825f63c4b09eb/298_200_3311_2214/master/3311.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"297.56266988825126\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Luka Vuskovic scores Spurs’ second goal.</span> Photograph: John Walton/PA</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"vuskovic-makes-his-mark\">Vuskovic makes his mark</h2><p>The towering 18-year-old Vuskovic, who played the second half at right centre-back, with Micky van de Ven to his left, agreed to move to Spurs from Hajduk Split in September 2023. There has been a lot of noise about his potential, a lot of expectation as he starred on loan at Westerlo in the Belgian top flight last season where he weighed in with seven goals. What an impact he had. The Croat had already clattered into one challenge and just about got away with a play-out-from-the-back move when he teed up Lankshear’s goal. His finish for the second was a beauty, a first-time left-foot drive, low into the far corner after Kudus’s pass. The Danish manager is blessed with centre-halves. Behind Cristian Romero and Van de Ven, he has Kevin Danso, Dragusin and Takai. Vuskovic would not be short of loan options if he were to sense he will not get the minutes he needs; Hamburg would be one in the Bundesliga. He wants to play at Spurs.</p><h2 id=\"kudus-is-the-real-star\">Kudus is the real star</h2><p>If it was easy to be drawn in by Vuskovic, it was impossible to ignore Kudus. Yes, it was only League One opposition, but the £54.5m new boy wowed with his sharpness and balance, his work in tight spaces, the impression he gave of always being in control of the ball and the situation. There was an explosion up the wing that led to a big chance for Jamie Donley, some lovely spins and time-buying feints, and the overall feeling that he seriously enjoyed himself.</p></div></div>"

Ghosh appealed for Beaumont to be given out obstructing the field, the umpires referred it upstairs, but Jacqueline Williams adjudged that Beaumont had merely been making her way back to her crease after deciding against taking a single.</p><p>“Richa [Ghosh] and Jemi [Rodrigues] definitely felt that maybe she kicked it, but the umpires referred it and it was not out,” Mandhana said. As for the fact that the bowler who sent down the ball in question happened to be Deepti Sharma? “We cracked a joke about Lord’s and Deepti.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-10\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id=\"b55c01dd-d986-4bf4-8686-af855eceda55\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Tammy Beaumont in discussions with the umpires.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59c3425c40c5e4f467149d668b332bcde3d75dd/0_0_3966_2739/master/3966.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"307.32602118003024\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Tammy Beaumont in discussions with the umpires after India thought she had obstructed the field.</span> Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Amy Jones described the incident as “weird”. “I’ve never been out there for one of those before,” she said. “Tammy had no intent of actually obstructing them, she was just trying to get back into her crease.”</p><p>Beaumont added just nine more runs before Sneh Rana trapped her leg-before, attempting a reverse sweep, but – after a brief further delay for rain, in which five more overs were lost and England’s target was revised to 115 – an unbeaten 46 from Jones ensured England eventually got across the line with relative ease.

Usyk vs. Dubois II follows their 2023 meeting in which the former won via 9th round knockout, and Usyk (23-0, 14 KOs) then proceeded to notch back-to-back wins over former champion Tyson Fury. Dubois (22-2, 21 KOs) has won three straight fights since dropping the first Usyk vs. Dubois contest, including a knockout victory over Anthony Joshua to retain his IBF title.</p><p>That belt, along with Usyk's WBA, WBO and WBC championships will all be on the line in Oleksandr Usyk vs. Daniel Dubois II. Wembley Stadium in London will host the undisputed heavyweight title fight, which has an approximate ring walk of 4:45 p.m. ET. Usyk is the -300 favorite in the latest Usyk vs. Dubois odds, with Dubois the +235 underdog. The over/under for total rounds is 9.5, with the Over favored at -125 and the Under listed at -110. The fight not going the distance is priced at -170.

His recent winners include calling Dimitry Bivol (+110) to pull the slight upset of Artur Beterbiev in their February rematch. In April, he correctly called Jarron Ennis to beat Eimantas Stanionis by KO (+155), while also correctly predicting the Under 10.5 rounds (+165). He also correctly called Jake Paul by decision (-110) against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. in June. He kept his hot streak going by recommending Katie Taylor (+170) against Amanda Serrano in their trilogy showdown just last week.

Nicknamed \"The Cat\", Usyk is coming off back-to-back victories over Fury, the former unified heavyweight champion whose only two defeats in his career have come at the hands of Usyk. The Ukrainian already holds a knockout victory over Dubois and has a pair of decision wins over Anthony Joshua as Usyk's last five bouts have seen him go 5-0 against three current or former heavyweight champions.</p><p>In the first Usyk vs. Dubois bout, the three-belt champion dominated, landing more punches in all nine rounds of the fight. He connected on nearly 25% of his punches thrown, while the Brit landed just 16.2% of his punches. Usyk floored Dubois in the ninth round, and even if the fight would have continued and gone to the cards, Usyk was in position to win. He was ahead on all three judges' scorecards, and he brings not only confidence from that fight but an overwhelming experience advantage into Saturday as Usyk has fought more than twice as many rounds (201 to 95) as Dubois.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/oleksandr-usyk-vs-daniel-dubois-2-odds-picks-esteemed-boxing-analyst-reveals-selections-for-july-19-heavyweight-title-unification-fight/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_boxing_Nagel_UsykDubois2\" target=\"_blank\">See which fighter to back here</a>.</p><h2>Why you should back Dubois</h2><p>The tale of the tape favors Usyk in terms of experience, but age and size go in Dubois' favor. He is 11 years younger than his opponent, has a two-inch height advantage, and could have a 20-plus pound weight advantage, going off what each contested their last fights at. Born and raised in London, Dubois will also have the Wembley crowd in his corner after the first fight between the two took place in Poland. The IBF champ also has something that Usyk, nor just about anyone else in the heavyweight division can measure up to, and that's Dubois' punching power as 21 of his 22 wins have come via knockout.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Dubois has been in this position before as an underdog as he was at +360 versus Joshua before flooring the former champ with a right hand in the fifth round. By comparison, Usyk had to go a full 12 rounds in both of his wins over Joshua, so the result versus a common opponent favors Dubois. Motivation will be at an all-time high for Dubois, considering his earlier defeat to Usyk, while the latter may already be looking ahead to an expected third fight with Fury, who recently aborted his retirement.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/oleksandr-usyk-vs-daniel-dubois-2-odds-picks-esteemed-boxing-analyst-reveals-selections-for-july-19-heavyweight-title-unification-fight/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_boxing_Nagel_UsykDubois2\" target=\"_blank\">See which fighter to back here</a>.</p><h2>How to make Usyk vs. Dubois II picks</h2><p>Nagel likes the Over on total rounds. He's also locked in a confident money-line picks and a method-of-victory prop that returns around +200. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/oleksandr-usyk-vs-daniel-dubois-2-odds-picks-esteemed-boxing-analyst-reveals-selections-for-july-19-heavyweight-title-unification-fight/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_boxing_Nagel_UsykDubois2\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine to see what it is</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who wins Oleksandr Usyk vs. Daniel Dubois,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and which method of victory prop could bring a big return?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/oleksandr-usyk-vs-daniel-dubois-2-odds-picks-esteemed-boxing-analyst-reveals-selections-for-july-19-heavyweight-title-unification-fight/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_boxing_Nagel_UsykDubois2\" target=\"_blank\">Join SportsLine here to see which bets you need to make for Usyk vs. Dubois 2, all from the accomplished veteran combat sports analyst who has consistently delivered winners.</a></strong></p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

But what makes this weekend's rematch against Dubois so different is that Usyk will be fighting a much more dangerous version of the explosive puncher than when the two first met in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Dubois, the 27-year-old from London, had already drawn criticism when he lost a 2020 showdown to fellow unbeaten Joe Joyce by refusing to continue after voluntarily taking a knee when he was struck in the eye by a jab. Even though it was later found that Dubois had suffered a fractured eye socket, he was seen by critics as an underachieving quitter.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/boxing-predictions-best-bets-odds-top-picks-to-consider-for-pacquiao-vs-barrios-usyk-vs-dubois-2/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Boxing predictions, best bets, odds: Top picks to consider for Pacquiao vs. Barrios, Usyk vs. Dubois 2</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brent Brookhouse                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Boxing predictions, best bets, odds: Top picks to consider for Pacquiao vs. Barrios, Usyk vs. Dubois 2\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/17/1c86cd52-7dec-4c96-b5d8-5004963eb5ff/thumbnail/270x152/ca80e7615e1659c975629ad89c0f2dc0/mario-barrios-hat.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>That reputation somewhat followed him through the first Usyk when a fatigued Dubois was dropped by a jab in Round 9 and appeared to wait until the referee's count of 10 before attempting to rise in yet another stoppage defeat. &nbsp;</p><p>The weight of the two high-profile defeats appeared to wake something up in Dubois. Four months later, he knocked out unbeaten Jarrell Miller in the 10th and final round. Then, in 2024, Dubois completely transformed his reputation by evolving into something more akin to a cyborg destroyer.</p><p>Dubois knocked out unbeaten Filip Hrgovic to claim the IBF title that was stripped from Usyk after he chose to enter a rematch with Fury rather than defend his title against a mandatory challenger. And one fight later, in the same stadium he will rematch Usyk on Saturday, Dubois capped off a bid for fighter of the year honors when he brutally finished Joshua in Round 5 of their slugfest.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>The combination of Dubois' resurgence and the fact that Usyk is now 38, and fresh off of a pair of grueling wins over Fury, has many questioning whether a different outcome could be in order for their rematch.</p><p>\"I prepared right and I'm just on a different level now,\" Dubois said at Wednesday's final press conference. \"I'm ready to go through whatever I need to on Saturday to get all of them belts. I am chasing glory and I am chasing greatness.</p><p>\"I'm switched on and focused. I'm ready to cause chaos in that ring, I'm ready to go.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>The only bit of controversy remaining from their first fight was a right uppercut to the body from Dubois in Round 5 that appeared to strike just slightly below the belt line that dropped Usyk. The punch was instantly ruled low by referee Luis Pabon, but it led to a fallout of hullabaloo as Dubois claimed, due to Usyk being down for a long time wincing in pain, that it should've been ruled a knockout.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, Usyk has remained as stoic, confident and succinct as ever before throughout the buildup to the rematch. Donning a white cape attached to his white suit with a furry black hat at this week's press conference, the only emotion Usyk displayed was when he was asked whether his age might leave him vulnerable to Dubois' concussive power.</p><p>\"Listen, I respect this guy, this young guy who is motivated,\" Usyk said. \"But I am, too. I am not an old guy, 38 is not old. We will see on Saturday if it's God's will.\"&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Asked whether a second straight stoppage of Dubois was in order, Usyk was even more short and direct.</p><p>\"Yes, I believe this,\" Usyk said.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.</p><h2>Usyk vs. Dubois 2 fight card, odds</h2><p><em>Odds via <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a></em></p><ul><li>Oleksandr Usyk (c) -300 vs. Daniel Dubois (c) +235, undisputed heavyweight title</li><li>Lawrence Okolie -230 vs. Kevin Lerena +180, heavyweights</li><li>Daniel Lapin -450 vs. Lewis Edmondson +320, light heavyweights</li><li>Lasha Guruli -1800 vs. James Francis +900, junior welterweights</li><li>Vladyslav Sirenko -650 vs. Solomon Dacres +425, heavyweights</li><li>Aadam Hamed -10000 vs. Ezequiel Gregores +1800, junior welterweights</li></ul><h2>Where to watch Usyk vs. Dubois 2</h2><ul><li><strong>Date:</strong>&nbsp;July 19&nbsp;|&nbsp;<strong>Location:</strong>&nbsp;Wembley Stadium -- London</li><li><strong>Start time:&nbsp;</strong>12:30 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>How to watch:</strong>&nbsp;DAZN PPV --&nbsp;<a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101l7syj/destination:https://www.dazn.com/boxing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">buy now</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<strong>Price:</strong>&nbsp;$59.99</li></ul><h2>Prediction</h2><p>For as much as Dubois' recent run of terror has been impressive, one does have to take into account the limitations of his opponents, even if one of them was the accomplished former champion Joshua.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Usyk, even at 38, is simply too skilled, too calculated and too tough to succumb to Dubois' pressure attack. In fact, outside of the controversial low blow that left Usyk down and hurt, their first fight was almost completely controlled by Usyk as he systematically wore Dubois down with power shots to set up the finish via stiff jab.&nbsp;</p><p>From his footwork to his efficient and accurate punching, Usyk is the kind of generational talent who hasn't yet received the full critical respect and fanfare worldwide that he deserves. Some of that is due to his humble, reserved nature but his game has spoke volumes ever since he first broke onto the scene as a professional by becoming the first four-belt champion in cruiserweight history.&nbsp;</p><p>Will his defense need to be on point as ever, especially considering how much Dubois has talked about walking through whatever comes his way? Of course. But Usyk's single lefthanded shots were strong enough to discipline both Joshua and Fury, and they should be enough to score a second win over Dubois.&nbsp;<strong><em>Pick: Usyk via UD12</em></strong></p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Who wins Oleksandr Usyk vs. Daniel Dubois,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and which method of victory prop could bring a massive return?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/oleksandr-usyk-vs-daniel-dubois-2-odds-picks-esteemed-boxing-analyst-reveals-selections-for-july-19-heavyweight-title-unification-fight/#ttag=07172025_agg_cbssports_picks_boxing_Nagel_UsykDubois2\" target=\"_blank\">Join SportsLine here to see which bets you need to make for Usyk vs. Dubois 2</a>, all from the accomplished veteran combat sports analyst who has consistently delivered winners.</strong></p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Perhaps no player in the league is as red-hot as Miami Marlins outfielder Kyle Stowers. Dating back to last Sunday, he's now 8 of his last 10 with five home runs and 11 RBI over that two-game span. His hot bat is a big reason SportsLine's model is backing the Marlins (+104) to pull the slight upset over the Royals on Saturday.</p><p>Elsewhere on the MLB schedule, the model is high on two other underdogs, backing the Reds +1.5 (-142) against the Mets and Nationals (+121) against the Padres.

When Scott Quinnell visited here four years ago, he broke down in tears standing in front of it. “Attitude is the first thing a Lions team needs to have,” Millar said. “If the attitude is right, the other things fall into place.”</p><p>Downstairs, the Lions’ attitude seems to be shaping up just fine. They are 10-0 up already, and the sting has already gone from the game. Truth is, it doesn’t feel like there’s a lot of jeopardy on this tour. Most people in the bar seem worried for Australia, who are in the unfamiliar position of being seen as easy-beats. “I’d hoped the Wallabies would give them more of a game than this,” says the man on the next barstool along. Turns out he has a Lions jersey of his own at home, 1989 vintage, although he’s not wearing it. “But then,” he says, “I was only a midweek player.”</p><p>Stevie, as they all call Steve Smith, was the reserve hooker for Finlay Calder’s Lions team, who came back from 1-0 down to beat Australia. “I played against his da’,” he says, watching the young Tom Lynagh on TV. Smith has the look of a man who’s done some hard living. Maybe his busted knuckles are still recovering from the time he knocked out four of Sean Fitzpatrick’s teeth.</p><p>He still seems a little in awe of McBride. “They were big shoes to fill.” But he loves Millar, who gave him a break by picking him for the Barbarians when he had been banned from playing for Ulster because of his misadventures on tour.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-11\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id=\"ce993bd5-16ca-40f6-adaa-41a599f5762d\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd63ec4f90c58608e78a982bdb9a3bbe29bcff4/0_0_3600_2363/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd63ec4f90c58608e78a982bdb9a3bbe29bcff4/0_0_3600_2363/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd63ec4f90c58608e78a982bdb9a3bbe29bcff4/0_0_3600_2363/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd63ec4f90c58608e78a982bdb9a3bbe29bcff4/0_0_3600_2363/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd63ec4f90c58608e78a982bdb9a3bbe29bcff4/0_0_3600_2363/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd63ec4f90c58608e78a982bdb9a3bbe29bcff4/0_0_3600_2363/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Steve Smith (without headband) is flanked by his British &amp; Irish Lions front row teammates Gareth Chilcott and Mike Griffiths during a tour game with the 1989 Lions in Australia.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd63ec4f90c58608e78a982bdb9a3bbe29bcff4/0_0_3600_2363/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"292.09305555555557\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Steve Smith (without headband) is flanked by his British &amp; Irish Lions front row teammates Gareth Chilcott and Mike Griffiths during a tour game with the 1989 Lions in Australia.</span> Photograph: Inpho Photography/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>But then everyone here owes a lot to Millar. He even came back to serve as the club rep after he finished his four-year stint as the chair of the International Rugby Board (now World Rugby). They say he used to give the union hell in the provincial committee meetings. When the French decided to award him the <em>Legion d’honneur</em>, they asked if he would fly out to Paris for the ceremony. No, Millar, told them, but you’re welcome to come here, and we can do it upstairs in the Ballymena clubhouse.</p><p>In Millar’s day Ballymena were the best club in Ulster, and Ulster were the best team in Ireland. Smith was part of the Ulster team that beat the Wallabies during their famous grand slam tour in 1984, 15-12 at Ravenhill, “a better Australian side than this one”, I say, and he doesn’t disagree. When Ulster won the Heineken Cup in 1998-99 they had 15 Ballymena players in the squad. No wonder the club won the all-Ireland title a few years later.</p><p>It’s different now. This is the first time in 20 years there’s not an Ulsterman on tour with the Lions, but no one’s complaining, Ulster are on their uppers, three million in debt and third-bottom in the URC. At Ballymena, too, there are members who ask why the club aren’t winning like they used to.</p><p>But back then McBride, Millar, Smith, Trevor Ringland and all the rest of the international players used to turn out for the club at every opportunity. These days their best young players get funnelled into the professional system, and they don’t see them again till they’re spat out the other end. They even took down a photograph of one of their more recent international players because he had never actually turned out for them, only been registered to the club by the governing body.</p><p>So Ballymena’s changing. They’ve become a community hub, and a participation club, with five adult sides, and a full slate in age groups, and a side for players with learning disabilities. “The Lions built this club,” Smith tells me. “It put us on the map.” But it’s true, I say back to him, that once upon a time a couple of men from this club built the Lions, too.</p></div></div>"

Hitting his ball from the rough, McIlroy somehow dug out a second, embedded ball that was below his in the grass.</p><p>It initially appeared as if McIlroy had whiffed on the shot as the ball popped straight up in the air and landed at his feet. However, replays showed he actually dug up a second ball on his followthrough that was embedded yet hidden jus tin front of his ball.</p><p>McIlroy was as stunned as anyone else over the bizarre sequence, picking up the second ball and having a bit of a laugh at the insanity of the moment. His actual ball ended up landing well short of the green, and he failed to get up-and-down for par, dropping his first shot of the day to go back to 5 under. McIlroy was suddenly seven shots off the lead again.</p><p>\"I honestly don't know [what happened]. It is the most weird, ridiculous thing I've ever seen,\" McIlroy said after the round. \"And then my ball came out really weird and spinny. it's just so strange. I knew it wasn't [mine], but it was just so weird.\"</p>\n        \n\n\n\n<p>McIlroy got off to a hot start to his third round at The Open, making three birdies in his first four holes to send the Northern Ireland crowd into a frenzy. A long birdie putt on the first set the tone and he backed that up with two more on No. 2 and No. 4 to have the fans buzzing before Scottie Scheffler and Matt Fitzpatrick even teed off in the final game.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From that point, it got a bit scratchy for McIlroy; he missed a few opportunities and had a couple wayward tee shots that kept him from continuing his charge up the leaderboard. The tough break leading to a bogey on No. 11 -- which followed what seemed to be a great break to avoid the gorse bushes off a wayward tee shot -- seemed to end any real hopes of contending on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the golf gods decided to give him one back on the 12th as he rolled in a long eagle putt to jump to 7 under and create a massive roar from the home crowd. \"This could be one of the coolest moments I've ever had on a golf course,\" said McIlroy later.</p>\n        \n\n\n<p>That putt and the ensuing roar from the crowd brought McIlroy's bounce back and he rode that energy to another birdie on the 15th and kept it on the tracks down the difficult close at Royal Portrush to card a 5-under 66. That was one shot off the low round of Saturday and moved him into the top 5 on the leaderboard going into Sunday's final round.</p><p>As he walked off the 18th green, he was just two shots behind Haotong Li in second place, but five back of Scheffler, who put some distance between himself and the field on Saturday. McIlroy hit 16 of 18 greens in regulation, his most in a single Open round at a course other than St. Andrews.</p><p>\"I've come here really just trying to embrace it,\" McIlroy said of the fan support he's received at his home course. \"If I hadn't won a major this year, if I hadn't won the Masters, I would have felt differently. It's almost a celebration of what I've been able to accomplish, and I want to celebrate with them, too. I'm really just trying to embrace everything this week. I'm having an incredible time. I'm really enjoying myself. I feel like I've given myself half a chance, and I'm excited for that tomorrow.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Barring a late stumble from the world No. 1, McIlroy will need something even better than his third-round 66 to get the win in front of his home crowd that he so desperately desires. Still, after the heartbreak of 2019 where he missed the cut in this setting, Saturday's walk around Royal Portrush where he finally treated his adoring Northern Irish fans to 18 holes of his A-game has to rank near the top of the most fun rounds of his career.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

      "category": "american-football",
      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div>\n        \n        \n                            \n                \n        <p>There's a notion in the NFL that players make the biggest jumps in between their first and second seasons, which one can parlay into quality Fantasy football advice. Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Quentin Johnston were first-round picks in 2023 who then made noticeable improvements as sophomores, so, perhaps, one can look at the 2024 draft class to identify 2025 Fantasy football breakouts. Rome Odunze, Ricky Pearsall and Xavier Legette were all first rounders from a year ago who had their moments, but with a full NFL offseason now under their belts, they could be poised to reach their full potential this season.</p><p>Marvin Harrison is also in that boat as he had a quality rookie year, but it didn't compare to Malik Nabers or Brian Thomas, both of whom were drafted after Harrison. Those are wideouts that you could keep an eye on when compiling your 2025 Fantasy football rankings by position, but which quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends will excel as sophomores? Before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>Last year, the model accurately predicted that Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels would comfortably outperform his ADP (QB13). The result: Daniels threw for 3,568 yards and 25 touchdowns with only nine interceptions and added 891 rushing yards with six more scores on the ground to take home NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. He finished as QB5 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and was a great addition to Fantasy football lineups.</p><p>The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.</p>\n        \n\n<p>&nbsp;The model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy Football sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking. The 2025 Fantasy football PPR rankings and 2025 Fantasy football standard rankings update multiple times daily, so you're always getting the best Fantasy football advice.</p><p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: 49ers receiver Jauan Jennings. It's not often that a fifth-year player can be considered a breakout, but that's the position Jennings is in thanks to the Niners' wide receiver room. He had never entered a season higher than No. 3 on the Niners' depth chart but is now a top option for Brock Purdy even with some trade rumors stirring due to him wanting a contract extension. San Francisco traded away Deebo Samuel to Washington this offseason, while Brandon Aiyuk is projected to start the year on the PUP list after a midseason ACL tear.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Jennings certainly showed he can handle being the alpha receiver as across his 10 starts last year, he averaged 5.9 receptions for 76.7 yards and six total touchdowns. Over a 17-start season, that projects to 100 catches for 1,310 yards and 10 touchdowns. Samuel twice finished as a top 10 Fantasy receiver with the Niners, while Aiyuk twice finished among the top 15. So, this is a wideout-friendly offense, and Jennings is a name to keep in mind in the mid-to-late rounds of Fantasy football 2025 drafts.</p><p>Another potential breakout that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/fantasy/\">Travis Hunter</a>, who has an over/under of 750.5 receiving yards. A lot is being made about how much he'll play on both sides of the ball and how it may cut into his production offensively. However, Hunter regularly handled well over 100 snaps per game at Colorado and the Jaguars desperately need a receiver opposite Brian Thomas Jr. to balance the passing attack.</p><p>Hunter led the Big 12 in receptions (96) and receiving touchdowns (15) while also ranking second in the conference and fifth nationally in receiving yards (1,258). He's got high-level body control and proven athleticism, and the model predicts that he outperforms receivers like Jameson Williams and Darnell Mooney, who both finished top 25 in the NFL in receiving yards last season.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">See which other Fantasy football breakouts 2025 to pick here</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankings</h2><p>SportsLine is also extremely high on a rookie running back to make an immediate impact. The model ranks this player as a top-10 option ahead of more established stars like Christian McCaffrey and Bucky Irving.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025 Fantasy Football breakouts should you target, and which RB shocks the NFL with a top-10 performance? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get 2025 Fantasy Football cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that called Jayden Daniels' breakout rookie season</a>, and find out.</strong></p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

It's hard to see him moving to Juve on a permanent basis for the same reason he didn't stay at <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c43a00b9-2826-72b3-77a0-62730abc936e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=363\">Chelsea</a>: he's going to have to take a major pay cut if he wants a multiyear deal, and he wasn't willing to do that at Stamford Bridge. The only way you can see this happening is a six-month loan deal with United covering a part of his wages. But something like that would happen only late in the window. And, bear in mind, Juventus already have a number of wingers.</p><p>As for Rashford, United are on the hook for another three seasons with him. You can't see this being a permanent deal, but he could fill the <a data-player-guid=\"3a3d05ac-9039-3e7b-e75c-adda1a51ab12\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/252971/randal-kolo-muani\">Randal Kolo Muani</a> role (he's on loan from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/160\">Paris Saint-Germain</a> and while Juve would like to keep him, it's not an easy negotiation) and would get to play <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.champions\">Champions League</a> football. Of course, this would be predicated on United paying a big chunk of his wages and, again, that's unlikely to happen at this stage of the window. <em>-- Gabriele Marcotti</em></p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/soccer/500-dark/364.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\"></p><h3>Will <a data-player-guid=\"9959537e-af42-929e-a829-cc149924d7f4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257390/luis-diaz\">Luis Díaz</a> still be at <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a47fbcec-c948-cf4c-9e41-3dfa37588c9c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=364\">Liverpool</a> when the season starts, or will <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/132/bayern-munich\" target=\"_blank\">Bayern Munich</a> or <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"58f7c4a9-c991-4ed4-fe5c-1f833cba75b8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=83\">Barcelona</a> land him?</h3><p>Liverpool have been pretty firm in their stance that Díaz is not available for transfer this summer.

FC shook up the Super League play-off picture with a superb win over reigning champions Wigan Warriors at the Brick Community Stadium.</b></p><p>The Black and Whites left Matt Peet's side stunned with a utterly dominant first-half display which saw them lead with 20 unanswered points.</p><p>And they returned after the break to show it had been no fluke adding two more tries to complete an impressive success that lifted them to sixth in the table.</p><p>While second-placed Wigan were below their usual high standards, Hull FC produced their best performance of the season, plotting a tactical masterclass to target the home side's vulnerability under the high ball.</p><p>Winger Christian Wade produced a superb solo effort to open Wigan's account in the second half, but on three occasions either side of the break his handling mistakes in trying to catch high kicks led to Hull tries.</p><p>Defeat for the Warriors was their fifth reverse of the season and handed Hull KR the chance to go four points clear at the top should they beat Catalans later on Saturday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Wigan almost made the ideal start when Zach Eckersley looked sure to touch down in the corner after four minutes, but his failure to ground the ball perhaps suggested this might not be a routine 80 minutes.</p><p>When the centre was helped off after suffering a potentially serious lower leg injury shortly after, the cards started to fall ominously for the home side.</p><p>Sure enough Hull FC took the lead and the manner of their opening try was to provide a template for how they dismantled their hosts throughout the afternoon.</p><p>Wade may be devastating going forward as he later proved, but Aidan Sezer had quickly worked out he was vulnerable under the high ball and his chip on the fifth tackle was fumbled by Wade and finished off by Jed Cartwright.</p><p>Jack Charles had added the extras, the first of six from six on an afternoon where his kicking proved flawless.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>A Kaide Ellis fumble 30 metres out was the next mistake from Wigan gifting excellent field position which a Sezer line break and offload gifted Cartwright a second on 23 minutes.</p><p>Sezer then produced a superbly angled cut through to go under the posts himself just after the 30-minute mark. A penalty from Charles just before the half-time hooter saw the Black and Whites go in 20-0 up.</p><p>If there were harsh words from Wigan's Peet at half-time the pep talk from his Hull counterpart John Cartwright proved no less effective.</p><p>Wade's superb rubber-ball run down the left, the winger's balance and dancing feet taking him over the line on 54 minutes suggested Wigan might make a game of it closing the score to 20-6.</p><p>But after Jai Field was forced from the field after hitting his head on the turf - subsequently failing a head injury assessment which rules him out of next week's clash with Catalan Dragons -&nbsp;Hull FC gradually reasserted their grip.</p><p>Harvey Barron should have converted in the right corner on 64 minutes but was tackled out of play behind the try-line but another Wade fumble under a high kick from Charles was finished off by Jordan Rapana.</p><p>Wigan's Ethan Havard, with added extras from Harry Smith, once again closed the gap to 26-12, but Jack Ashworth put the icing on a brilliant performance with a late try to extend the lead back up to 20 close to the hooter.</p><p>It was a second win over Wigan for Hull FC this season following victory in the Challenge Cup in March, but Cartwright will now have to focus on home form which has been their Achilles heel this season.</p><p>They have just one home win, against Wakefield Trinity last weekend, but after this confidence booster they host Super League's bottom two in Huddersfield Giants and Salford Red Devils.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p><b>Wigan coach Matt Peet:</b></p><p>\"Christian Wade came to me straight away on the field and said sorry to the team for making a few errors, but I understand that these things happen, and it was my decision to select him.</p><p>\"I'd seen enough in practice and last week to think we would take a step in the right direction, but credit to Hull FC, they were clinical and Christian made a few mistakes.</p><p>\"But he's been around the block and he'll keep working hard on his game. That's the nature of the sport.</p><p>\"We're disappointed to lose, particularly conceding the points we did in the way we did in the first half, but I understand how and why it happened. It surprises me when people are surprised by it. </p><p>\"If you look at the league table at the moment it's very wide open in terms of who can get into the play-offs.\"</p><p><b>Hull FC coach John Cartwright told BBC Radio Humberside:</b></p><p>\"I thought it was a great team performance. We have had a rough few weeks trying to hold on to the ball which has hurt us but today everything came together for us.</p><p>\"Christian Wade is very dangerous with the ball but he is new to the game and by kicking high to him and trying to make the tackle on him you take away that carry that he has. The position of the kick and the chase was the key.</p><p>\"I doubt whether many people thought we could have won but [underdog] is a tag I've always enjoyed. It is not often a plan comes to fruition 100% and today was one of those days.</p><p>\"We are in the mix [for the play-offs] and we play a lot of sides in front of us so it's going to be a really tough eight weeks until the end of the season but we have to enjoy the challenge.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p><b>Wigan:</b> Field, Marshall, Eckersley, Wardle, Wade, Keighran, Smith, Havard, O'Neill, Dupree, Nsemba, Farrell, Ellis</p><p><i>Interchanges:</i> Mago, Byrne, Leeming, Hill</p><p><b>Hull FC:</b> Hardaker, Barron, Rapana, Litten, Martin, Charles, Sezer, Ese'ese, Cust, Knight, Cartwright, Fash, Aydin</p><p><i>Interchanges:</i> Ashworth, Briscoe, Laidlaw, Hutchinson</p><p><b>Referee:</b> Liam Moore.</p></div></article></main></div></div>"

All 30 bets won, after Rozier, an eight-year veteran with the Hornets at the time, exited 10 minutes into the game, citing a foot issue.</p><p>In all, at least six sportsbooks in multiple states detected suspicious betting on Rozier props that day, with the bulk of the activity occurring in Louisiana and Mississippi, according to sources familiar with a report issued by U.S. Integrity, a firm that monitors the betting market for abnormalities.</p><p>The NBA investigated the unusual activity in 2023 and found that no league rules were violated. Two years later, Rozier is one of three NBA players known to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/43627495/federal-investigators-eyeing-terry-rozier-play-2023-game\">have been under investigation</a> by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Rozier has not been charged or accused of any wrongdoing.</p><p>The bettor in Biloxi placed the bets at Harrah's Gulf Coast on the under on Rozier's points, rebounds and assists, according to a list of wagers included in the documents. The largest bet, a $2,700 wager on under 5.5 rebounds for Rozier, was made over the counter, using a casino player's card. The other 29 bets were placed on a self-serve betting kiosk, a few hundred dollars at a time, beginning at 9:37 a.m., before the sportsbook counter was open, according to the records.</p><p>Attempts to reach the bettor were unsuccessful.</p><p>Harrah's Gulf Coast (Caesars) initially refused to pay the winning tickets, citing a house rule on \"rigging\" and suspicion of \"inside information,\" according to emails from the sportsbook to regulators obtained by ESPN. The casino asked the Mississippi Gaming Commission for permission to void the bets entirely.</p><p>\"Has Caesars been able to come up with any evidence to support this being insider information?\" a Mississippi Gaming Commission enforcement team leader asked the sportsbook in an email on April 5. \"If not, the property which I believe is Harrah's Gulf Coast/Caesars will need to pay out the wagers.\"</p><p>A week later, on April 12, a Caesars representative informed the commission in an email that it was settling the wagers on Rozier. The bettor won a net $13,017.70.</p><p>Rozier, who was not listed on the Hornets' pregame injury report, finished the game with 5 points, 4 rebounds and 2 assists, all under the betting line on his statistics.

At 2:24 p.m. the day of the game, U.S. Integrity sent a nationwide alert about \"Suspicious Wagering Terry Rozier NBA Player Props,\" according to documents ESPN obtained through another open records request.</p><p>Most prominent sportsbooks halted betting on Rozier props within an hour of the U.S. Integrity alert, according to an archived odds feed from betting analytics site Unabated.com.</p><p>League rules prohibit players from betting on the NBA or sharing non-public information with anyone \"associated with gambling.\" The NBA declined to comment.</p><p>Rozier's attorney, Jim Trusty, said while the federal inquiry remains ongoing, his client is not a target of the investigation. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York said in an email that they could not confirm or deny Rozier's status in the investigation and declined further comment.</p><p>Trusty said Rozier met with NBA and FBI officials multiple times in 2023 and that the initial investigation determined that he had done nothing wrong.</p><p>\"It's unfortunate that he's a big name in sports and is having to endure all this,\" Trusty told ESPN. \"My hope and expectation is that at some point that they'll be done with their investigation and will be professional enough to let us know that it's 100% over and that they reached the same conclusion that was reached in 2023.\"</p><p>Rozier is part of the same federal gambling investigation that led to former <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5a9c33b8-63fd-ff34-a833-925fe89320a6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/tor/toronto-raptors\">Toronto Raptors</a> center Jontay Porter being banned from the NBA.

The champions remain in talks over a fee for Ekitike, who is understood to have a €100m (£87m) release clause in his Eintracht contract, with a deal expected to be completed next week. Germany’s Sky Sport reported on Saturday night that a second written bid had been submitted.</p><p>Howe admitted Newcastle are “desperate” to keep Isak, who has three years remaining on his contract, but added he could not give “100% clarity” on any player’s future.</p><p>The Newcastle manager said of the striker’s absence in Glasgow: “It was my decision. He travelled back to Glasgow with us but I decided to send him home due to the speculation around him. The last thing he wanted is to be sat in the stand watching, that wasn’t fair to him. But I’m confident he will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window.”</p><p>Howe, who also omitted Joelinton against the Scottish champions, added: “It’s difficult for me to give 100% clarity on any player. Alex is happy at Newcastle, he loves the players, the staff, the team. I’m confident he’ll be here at the start of the season. Yes, I’ve had discussions with him but that’s not abnormal. I respect a player’s career and how short it is. Alex has been really good, he’s trained really well and I realise there’ll be noise around him.”</p><p>Liverpool’s decision to go for Ekitike, who made it clear he favoured a move to Anfield over St James’ Park before Newcastle pulled out of the race for the striker, represents another frustration in what has been a problematic transfer window for Howe.</p><p>Newcastle have also missed out on João Pedro, Bryan Mbeumo and Liam Delap while their long-running pursuit of Burnley’s £40m-rated goalkeeper James Trafford is now in doubt with Manchester City linked with their former player.</p><p>Howe and his nephew, Andy Howe, have been overseeing much of Newcastle’s recruitment this summer, with Paul Mitchell having left as sporting director and Darren Eales due to depart on health grounds.

That is a handsome payday but not one all that uncommon at this time in professional golf.&nbsp;</p><p>The Open Championship is the ultimate example of how prize money doesn't determine the importance of an event, as the total purse is less than the other three majors and even a PGA Tour signature event -- the winner's cut being the same amount. However, no one would confuse a signature event as being as important as The Open, and while the R&amp;A has upped its payouts amid golf's purse arm's race, it has not chased being the ultimate pay day.</p><p>The chance to etch one's name in golf history is what makes The Open of the most important and special events in the sport. Certainly those in the United Kingdom would argue it's <em>the</em> most important. Still, a $3.1 million payday doesn't hurt for the winner, and the top three finishers each receiving over $1 million is not too shabby, either.</p><p>With Scottie Scheffler on top after two rounds and hometown star Rory McIlroy running hot on Moving Day, this Open is going to be an absolute battle to the finish. A bevy of other former major champions are in contention, and if weather lets up a bit, scores could be remarkably low as play concludes Sunday.

While the weather has been a beast all week, everyone in the field is hoping conditions can lighten up in Round 3 so they can put forth an effort similar to the one Scottie Scheffler posted when he scored the lowest round of his major championship career with a 64. Follow <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/the-open-2025-leaderboard-live-updates-golf-scores-open-championship-coverage-round-3-at-royal-portrush/live/\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Open leaderboard live coverage throughout Round 3</a> on Saturday.</p><p>With only 70 men out of the massive Open field making the cut, the battle will continue on the shores of Northern Ireland with 16 men -- those within seven shots of Scheffler -- truly competing for one of the most prestigious titles in the sport: Champion Golfer of the Year.</p><p>Royal Portrush is hosting for just the third time in the history of the world's oldest golf championship with the Claret Jug set to be awarded outside Scotland or England in a rare circumstance. The course will continue to press most remaining in the field, especially considering even the likes of Rory McIlroy -- making his homecoming this week -- has put together poor rounds on these links.</p><p>Then-16-year-old McIlroy set the course record in Portrush with a 61 back in the day. Despite that, the last time The Open was hosted at this site in 2019, he ejected immediately with a 79. Just 24 hours later, he rebounded to shoot a 65 -- a 14-shot swing from one day to the next. Bryson DeChambeau has nearly accomplished the same this week as he barely slid inside the cutline. In other words, if a career grand slam winner and native son -- plus a modern champion -- can be tested by Royal Portrush, no one in the field this week is safe.</p><p>The action continues Saturday with Round 3 setting the stage for the final 18 holes of this year's last major. The grounds are filled to capacity with fans, and they are undoubtedly keen to see how the likes of Scheffler, McIlroy, Shane Lowry, Robert MacIntyre, Matt Fitzpatrick, Jon Rahm and others fare across the last two rounds of The Open.</p>\n        \n\n<p>There is so much to follow this week that it can be overwhelming at times.

This might just be the highlight, though: a tee shot drawn into the 192-yard 13th which takes a couple of bounces and disappears into the cup! He’s warmly congratulated by his playing partner, the 1997 champion Justin Leonard. That matches the feat of Emiliano Grillo, who aced this hole during the first round back in 2019. Parry is playing in only his second Open, having teed it up at St Andrews three years ago, finishing the week in a tie for 62nd.

length. But it’s always staying out on the high side. He taps in for par. But here’s why even that might not be good enough, and why he was so desirous of a <em>big</em> birdie chance: back on the par-three 13th, Scottie Scheffler clips his tee shot to 14 feet. Another huge opportunity for the leader coming up.</p><p><em>-13: Scheffler (12)<br>\n  -10: Fitzpatrick (12)<br>\n  -9: Hatton (14), Li (13)<br>\n  -8: McIlroy (17), Gotterup (16), English (15)<br>\n  -7: Schauffele (F)</em></p></article><article id=\"block-687bd6748f08dbd6c5293401\"><header></header><p><strong>Rory McIlroy carves a wild drive into the gallery down the right of 17.</strong> He’s fortunate it’s so bad; a little bit nearer the fairway and he’d be in thick filth. But he’s copped a decent lie, trodden down by the punters. That allows their hero to whip a wedge into the heart of the green. A huge roar. It’s a decent-enough escape from an unpromising position, but it’s hardly a birdie chance, and that’s what McIlroy wanted, if the slightly underwhelming look on his face is anything to go by. His expression is incongruous with the joy of his people, but that’s fandom for you. Still, he’s got two putts for par, and if he makes them, he’ll have got away with a spectacularly awful tee shot. So it’s swings and roundabouts.</p></article><article id=\"block-687bd5998f0826202a136364\"><header></header><p><strong>Haotong Li makes only his second bogey of the week.</strong> And it’s a dismal one, a three-foot putt tugged nervously left, always missing from the moment it leaves the face of the putter. He’s back to -9. Meanwhile how about this late charge from Lee Westwood? Since the turn, he’s made six birdies in eight holes, at 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and now 17! He’d be onto something here … had he not gone out in 40. Still, he’s two under for his round and -5 overall. Pars meanwhile for Scottie Scheffler and Matt Fitzpatrick at 11.</p></article><article id=\"block-687bd5248f0826202a136361\"><header></header><p><strong>Bob MacIntyre calms down by the time he reaches the greenside bunker he’s found on 14.</strong> That doesn’t stop him hitting a hot one out of it. The ball flies over the green and ends up in a swale on the far side. He nearly makes the putt coming back up, but that’s a bogey that drops Oban’s finest back to -6.</p></article><article id=\"block-687bd3ef8f082b80ee7385c1\"><header></header><p><strong>A brilliant up and down from an unpromising position on the par-three 16th by Rory McIlroy.</strong> Having carved his tee shot down the rough-strewn bank to the right, it’s all he can do to avoid a flyer and find the centre of the green. Or so you’d think. Instead he elegantly swishes out to a couple of feet, and tides up for his par. He remains at -8. Meanwhile scenes on 18, where Justin Rose tramlines a 50-footer from off the green for a closing birdie! He raises both arms in jubilation and soaks up the love from the crowd. It’s not quite Birkdale in 1997, but it’s another great moment for one of the game’s most popular players. A 68 and last year’s runner-up is -5 overall.</p></article><article id=\"block-687bd2bd8f0826202a136358\"><header></header><p><strong>… but it was bogey for Matt Fitzpatrick, who was unable to get up and down from a much easier position, the fringe at the front.</strong> The margins are small, and yet so very big. And with Scottie Scheffler unwilling to cede an inch, others in the field are betrayed by their frustration. Bob MacIntyre pulls his approach at 14 into a bunker, and then spikes his iron into the turf with such force that it balloons 10, maybe 15 feet into the sky before coming back down to earth and landing apologetically. Oh Bob. What strength, though!</p><p><em>-13: Scheffler (11)<br>\n  -10: Li (11), Fitzpatrick (11)<br>\n  -9: Hatton (13)<br>\n  -8: McIlroy (15), Gotterup (14)</em></p></article><article id=\"block-687bd1b08f0826202a136352\"><header></header><p><strong>Scheffler’s up the bank, knee high in grass.</strong> He swishes out of the filth beautifully, landing his ball softly on the fringe, rolling it up to nine feet. In goes the putt, a gentle left-to-right slider, and it’s fair to say he’s passed that test. Par. A small pump of the fist. Who says it doesn’t mean anything to him?</p><figure id=\"923faed5-3b23-43c6-baed-a7f24275dfcc\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49129405b341d23860f9734c2db46468176101e4/0_0_7348_4899/master/7348.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49129405b341d23860f9734c2db46468176101e4/0_0_7348_4899/master/7348.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49129405b341d23860f9734c2db46468176101e4/0_0_7348_4899/master/7348.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49129405b341d23860f9734c2db46468176101e4/0_0_7348_4899/master/7348.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Scottie Scheffler plays out of the rough to the 11th green.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49129405b341d23860f9734c2db46468176101e4/0_0_7348_4899/master/7348.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\" height=\"310.0210941752858\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Scottie Scheffler plays out of the rough to the 11th green.</span> Photograph: Jon Super/AP</figcaption></figure></article><article id=\"block-687bd0d98f08dbd6c52933f0\"><header></header><p><strong>A really strange unforced error from Scottie Scheffler.</strong> He’s in the semi-rough to the right of the 11th fairway. Just a wedge in from 149 yards … but he seems to lose his rhythm on the downswing, and ends up with just one hand on the club on the follow-through. The ball squirts off to the left of the green, and dunks into some thick oomska. This hole might be in his head; he’s bogeyed it twice already this week. His first big test of the day coming up.</p></article><article id=\"block-687bcfd68f08dbd6c52933ea\"><header></header><p><strong>A huge break for Rory McIlroy at 15.</strong> He hits a hot one out of some semi-rough down the left of 15. “Aw sit!” he pleads his ball. It doesn’t. But what it does do is hit the flagstick! The ball, stunned, drops dead a couple of feet from the cup, and in goes the birdie putt. Up goes the roar, and the home hero rises to -8 … one shy of Tyrrell Hatton, who comes up just short of the par-five 12th green in two, but chips up to kick-in distance to set up another birdie.</p><p><em>-13: Scheffler (10)<br>\n  -11: Fitzpatrick (10)<br>\n  -10: Li (11)<br>\n  -9: Hatton (12)<br>\n  -8: Gotterup (13)<br>\n  -7: Schauffele (F), English (12), MacIntyre (12)</em></p></article><article id=\"block-687bcee58f08dbd6c52933dd\"><header></header><p><strong>Scottie Scheffler misses another gettable birdie putt, this time at 10.</strong> But for a few millimetres here and there, at 9 and 10, he could now be four clear.

Li’s been solid and unspectacular so far today, but with two birdies and nine pars, he’s yet to take a backward step.

Two holes later, he claimed the shot back. He’s done something very similar now, making bogey on 11 after whistling his tee shot into a bush and being forced to take a drop, then hooking wide left, before getting up and down to … yes … limit the damage to bogey. And now he’s snatched the shot back with birdie at 12! This is seriously impressive stuff from English, coming in under the radar and flatly refusing to go away.

So with the nation’s favourite son out on the course, and the leaders soon to follow, now’s a good time to take stock of how the top of the leaderboard looks …</p><p><em>-10: Scheffler<br>\n  -9: Fitzpatrick<br>\n  -8: Harman, Li<br>\n  -5: R Højgaard, Hatton, MacIntyre, English, Gotterup<br>\n  -4: Conners (F), Parry (16), Clark (13), Wallace (7), Finau, N Højgaard<br>\n  -3: Spaun (12), D Johnson (12), Henley (10), Im (8), Glover (7), Fleetwood (6), Lindell (5), Schauffele (3), Åberg (2), Burns (1), Westwood (1), Bradley, McIlroy, Smith</em></p></article><article id=\"block-687b9d418f082b80ee738425\"><header></header><p><strong>Having announced Sung-jae Im’s blistering start with such a fanfare, the inevitable occurs.</strong> Bogey at 8. Just the one par on his card so far today. But John Parry is continuing in the right direction, following up his ace at 13 with birdie at 15. He’s -4 for the tournament, alongside Wyndham Clark, who makes his fourth birdie of the day at 12, and Matt Wallace, who’s made <em>his</em> fourth birdie of the round at 7! Yeah, there’s a score out there all right, for anyone whose irons are dialled in. If Scottie Scheffler’s driver behaves, say goodnight to the rest of the field.</p></article><article id=\"block-687b9cb18f082b80ee738420\"><header></header><p><strong>… so there’s a score out there, if someone wants it.</strong> Corey Conners is the best of the bunch back in the clubhouse right now, having shot 66. The 33-year-old Canadian, who has never really done it at the Open before, is -4 overall, and that’s some good moving. And if that isn’t illustrative enough, Sung-jae Im is currently four under for his round through 7. And that’s with a bogey at 3. He’s made five birdies, at 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7, and is clearly of a mind to match his top-ten finish last year at Troon at the very least. He’s -4 for the championship.</p></article><article id=\"block-687b9c678f082b80ee73841e\"><header></header><p><strong>The weather report. </strong>Sunny intervals, not too much wind, and that’s been reflected in the early scoring, which we’ll get onto in a minute. There’s a chance the wind will pick up later, and there could even be some rain, but don’t bet the farm on any of this definitely happening, it’s the Open, it’s an Irish summer, the weather is what it will be. Rain very much likely tomorrow, mind.</p></article><article id=\"block-687b9bc18f082b80ee73841d\"><header><h2>Hole-in-one for Parry</h2></header><p><strong>Before we get into the thick of the action, let’s kick-start our day with a sugar rush: news of a hole-in-one!</strong> It’s already been a good season for John Parry: the 38-year-old from Harrogate won on the DP World Tour for the first time in 15 years, at the Mauritius Open; came second at the Kenya Open and the Alfred Dunhill, and tied for fourth at the Soudal Open. This might just be the highlight, though: a tee shot drawn into the 192-yard 13th which takes a couple of bounces and disappears into the cup! He’s warmly congratulated by his playing partner, the 1997 champion Justin Leonard. That matches the feat of Emiliano Grillo, who aced this hole during the first round back in 2019. Parry is playing in only his second Open, having teed it up at St Andrews three years ago, finishing the week in a tie for 62nd. He’s made a bigger mark this time.</p><figure id=\"b389e5a0-0a55-418f-8b3b-1eddf5d64f61\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"

Cockcroft: </strong>With the news Thursday that Rice has been sentenced to five years of probation and 30 days of jail time as part of a plea agreement stemming from his role in a 2024 multicar crash in Dallas, the odds of him serving a multigame suspension have significantly increased. Fantasy managers should brace for the likelihood Rice will miss a noticeable portion of the 2025 season.</p><p>This had long been a possibility, with the NFL choosing to wait to rule until the legal process played itself out, but now that Rice's penalty has been handed out, the league is sure to move quickly to announce a potential suspension.</p><p>I've moved Rice down in my rankings, from 21st among wide receivers to 28th, between <a data-player-guid=\"774cc71b-e83e-340d-bcda-4a8558265bb5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431299/rome-odunze\">Rome Odunze</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"a86b2e46-69f6-f60b-3017-063d68c54345\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426388/jameson-williams\">Jameson Williams</a>, reflecting a probable absence.

Including the postseason, he had team bests of 140 targets, a 23.0% target share, 28.2% target rate per route and 108 receptions during that span.

Cockcroft:</strong> Smith was one of 2024's biggest breakthrough players, pacing all tight ends in PPR fantasy points following the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"af33088b-1e19-d27d-dbc0-354fd7151703\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a>' Week 6 bye. He was heavily targeted in the red zone during that time, seeing 17 in 12 games, so some regression, particularly in the touchdown department, was inevitable. Considering Smith is now reunited with Arthur Smith, under whom he finished 48th (2017), 35th (2018), 20th (2019), 17th (2020) and 17th (2023) in scoring at his position in five of his eight NFL seasons, those concerns only heighten.

Much of his fantasy production will hinge on how effectively <a data-player-guid=\"5fbab03e-2816-55ab-ae10-83b132803d9e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> rebounds from his disappointing 2024.

Harvey has the traits to be deployed as a dual-threat back in this system. However, Dobbins will take some carries away from Harvey, and his physical running style could lead to more work on the goal line. Because of that, Harvey will drop down some slots in my preseason rankings, but he remains a solid RB2/Flex.</p><p>Yes, Dobbins does have an injury history, playing in just 37 games over his first four seasons as a pro. That must be mentioned here. But if Dobbins can stay healthy, he fits as a No. 2 in this offense, which would diminish the roles of <a data-player-guid=\"68a0f5f2-bb16-314e-af01-398fd4027a48\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569682/audric-estime\">Audric Estime</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"ee54ff50-5e40-3bd7-a534-9f6ef4ff7c9a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4722893/jaleel-mclaughlin\">Jaleel McLaughlin</a> in 2025.</p><hr><h2>June 5: What Aaron Rodgers to the Steelers means for fantasy</h2><p><strong>Matt Bowen:</strong> <a data-player-guid=\"5fbab03e-2816-55ab-ae10-83b132803d9e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a> plans to sign with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"debcd592-8d53-71f1-fc15-5c8b8ef9df6e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Thursday.</p><p>Rodgers, who will turn 42 during the 2025 season, threw for 3,897 yards, 29 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions last year as a member of the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"732d3caf-b350-1e34-48c6-b7cebb4a0d88\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a>, who, coincidentally, will host the Steelers in Week 1. <a data-player-guid=\"7e9fbd60-951e-2d9a-8d8c-b3f1ab6c4a4d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a>, who started the first six games for Pittsburgh last season, is now the presumed starter for the Jets.</p><p>In terms of Rodgers' fantasy impact, we had already been <a href=\"https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections\">projecting his stats</a> based on him joining the Steelers.</p><p>So let's discuss the veteran quarterback's skill set at this stage of his career and what it means on the fantasy front for the Pittsburgh offense.</p><p>Based on the tape I've watched, the arm talent still pops with Rodgers, as do the quick release and accelerated field vision. He can get the ball out and identify post-snap coverage rotations with ease. Yes, the mobility and pocket poise have declined, which does limit his opportunities to create outside of structure at a higher rate, but in a run-oriented offense, one that will also use play-action elements to keep the pocket firm, Rodgers can function and produce in Arthur Smith's system.</p><p>With Rodgers' arrival, <a data-player-guid=\"c6727be7-1ac0-315c-437d-e281fe9a2e84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047650/dk-metcalf\">DK Metcalf</a>'s fantasy value gets a slight boost from where it had been before the QB's arrival. Metcalf has the field-stretching ability to run the outside verticals and deep in-breakers, plus he will be a top quick-gain target for Rodgers on slants, unders and screens. That puts Metcalf in the WR2/Flex range heading into the 2025 fantasy season, while <a data-player-guid=\"dd0c7d09-aed2-e7dd-defd-12de97619e6e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361411/pat-freiermuth\">Pat Freiermuth</a> remains a midtier TE2 with potential streaming upside who can be viewed as a big body option in the middle of the field.</p><p>Remember, Rodgers averaged 15.1 PPG with both <a data-player-guid=\"da106063-995d-eaf0-54e4-ccecd5e90767\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson\">Garrett Wilson</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"d287bc03-47c2-c7f6-6160-e4280c80d2e2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16800/davante-adams\">Davante Adams</a> as his top targets last season in New York. And in a Steelers offense that will use the run game as a foundational piece, Rodgers fits best as a QB2 who can be started in 2QB Superflex formats or as a matchup-based streaming option.</p>\n</div></div>"

Eric joined ESPN in 2021 after working as a senior fantasy analyst at Pro Football Network. Prior to that, he spent much of his career as a manager at a Fortune 100 financial services company.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p>When the Patriots turned to <a data-player-guid=\"2fbd2f9e-624d-3e63-9bb5-9bb965782b68\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431452/drake-maye\">Drake Maye</a> in Week 6 of the 2024 season, they tasked the No. 3 overall pick with revitalizing an offense plagued by inconsistency and inexperience.</p><p>In 11 starts from Week 6 to Week 17, Maye threw for 2,254 yards, 15 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, while adding 409 rushing yards and two rushing scores. That translated to an average of 16.0 fantasy points per game in those starts, which would have ranked just outside the top 12 quarterbacks over a full season.</p><p>Maye's efficiency was notable. He finished 17th in quarterback rating (QBR) and threw at least one touchdown in every full game he played.</p><p>Entering his second NFL season, Maye has all the makings of a top-10 fantasy quarterback. After showing promise in his rookie year, he enters a far better offensive situation and offers the dual-threat skill set that fantasy managers covet.</p><p>Here's why Maye, whose current average draft position of 152.3 in ESPN leagues ranks 18th amongst quarterbacks, deserves serious attention in your 2025 fantasy drafts:</p><h3>An upgraded supporting cast</h3><p>The biggest offseason addition for the Patriots is <a data-player-guid=\"d6ba7023-458c-f59a-4af2-638770067518\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976212/stefon-diggs\">Stefon Diggs</a>, a proven wideout with six 1,000-yard seasons and a career average of 72.8 receiving yards per game. Diggs' route-running and separation skills should immediately elevate Maye's passing ceiling.</p><p>The Patriots also added <a data-player-guid=\"f125b093-8b6f-4d5d-8984-87d3babbc871\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2991662/mack-hollins\">Mack Hollins</a>, rookie <a data-player-guid=\"359ec99e-3714-88dc-c5de-1dc522b8369f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4613202/kyle-williams\">Kyle Williams</a> and dynamic second-round running back <a data-player-guid=\"714eed1f-95d7-3242-83da-3b34074b4424\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432710/treveyon-henderson\">TreVeyon Henderson</a>, who brings pass-catching ability out of the backfield. This gives Maye a much deeper and more versatile group of playmakers than he had as a rookie.</p><p>There are also improvements on the offensive line, which is notable given the major protection issues last season. The Patriots ranked near the bottom of the league in pass block win rate and last in run block win rate. While Maye played in only 13 games as a rookie, he was sacked 34 times, ranking 15th in the league.</p><p>To address this, New England added veteran linemen <a data-player-guid=\"62369aa1-bdb6-6b21-ea1e-e79d281fca87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16771/morgan-moses\">Morgan Moses</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"40b9701e-a203-238b-b55f-9caf4d52a5d9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116729/garrett-bradbury\">Garrett Bradbury</a>, drafted left tackle <a data-player-guid=\"f46f0143-892d-3a44-aab2-b9ce2072676a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685298/will-campbell\">Will Campbell</a> in the first round and picked up center <a data-player-guid=\"003d3a7c-a5e0-3b5d-a478-6d9bf50c012e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4599198/jared-wilson\">Jared Wilson</a>. Even moderate improvement here could lead to cleaner pockets and more consistent production from Maye.</p><p>In addition, new head coach Mike Vrabel arrives with a run-heavy background from his time in Tennessee, but the return of Josh McDaniels as offensive coordinator signals a more balanced and adaptable approach.</p><p>McDaniels knows how to build schemes around his quarterback's strengths. Expect early-down runs to set up play-action and run-pass options that allow Maye to take advantage of mismatches. This system plays to both his passing ability and his mobility.</p><h3>The rushing floor matters in fantasy</h3><p>Maye's rushing ability is a major asset, especially compared to some other young quarterbacks who don't utilize the ground game as much. Maye ranked ninth at QB in rushing yards and first at the position with 7.8 yards per rush (minimum 20 carries), showing the ability to extend plays and salvage fantasy points even when under pressure.</p><p>Even in games where passing numbers dip, a handful of scrambles can lead to 50 rushing yards, which translates to 5.0 fantasy points before touchdowns are even considered. This gives him a reliable fantasy floor.</p><p>That rushing safety net makes Maye a more appealing option than pocket passers such as <a data-player-guid=\"987f4f39-ed6f-5915-57eb-ec7dc356171c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"147e6862-2ac0-3a97-8f36-e3b1c0147320\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432577/cj-stroud\">C.J. Stroud</a>, who don't offer the same mobility.</p><h3>Favorable schedule and valuable fill-in</h3><p>The Patriots have the sixth-easiest schedule in 2025, according to ESPN analyst Mike Clay's <a href=\"https://g.espncdn.com/s/ffldraftkit/25/NFLDK2025_CS_ClayProjections2025.pdf\">strength of schedule matrix</a>.</p><p>Maye also lines up well as a bye-week fill-in for managers with <a data-player-guid=\"37d87523-280a-9d4a-0adb-22cfc6d3619c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"e6957db5-5b2e-a82d-c788-d889115d9772\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a>, who have byes in Week 10, or <a data-player-guid=\"f03f3238-b035-6f0e-5844-1529ca021c3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426348/jayden-daniels\">Jayden Daniels</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"ec880cbc-1490-cdae-548f-f844104974ae\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"3858bbe0-6348-e3ef-5d9f-2dd2acb46f44\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>, who have byes in Week 12.</p><p>In those matchups, Maye draws the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"13e8b157-a75a-ff24-ae91-fa3d52ddf204\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"75b8623b-8926-b411-0476-3d3602b78523\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals\">Cincinnati Bengals</a> -- two defenses that struggled to contain dual-threat quarterbacks last year. This kind of flexibility positions him as a high-end QB2 or a smart component of a quarterback committee approach.</p><h3>Addressing the concerns</h3><p>Maye ranked 10th in the league in off-target percentage (13.6%) last season, a reflection of the risky passes he was forced to make under pressure behind a struggling offensive line. With upgrades to protection and better offensive talent around him, that number should drop.</p><p>Diggs' recovery from an ACL injury is another variable. If his snaps are limited early in the season, Maye will need to rely more on Williams, Hollins and <a data-player-guid=\"71ece68a-acb1-12a8-cce6-9331bdea0f83\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4427095/demario-douglas\">DeMario Douglas</a>. Fortunately, that group has enough depth to fill in, with 2024 second-rounder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430637/jalynn-polk\">Ja'Lynn Polk</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"399d0ebb-43a6-3c68-a978-cb744c759208\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429022/kayshon-boutte\">Kayshon Boutte</a> also in the mix.</p><p>While Vrabel's reputation suggests a run-focused offense, his Tennessee teams still utilized quarterback mobility when available. Maye's rushing ability could make him a focal point rather than an afterthought. On top of that, Maye has had a full offseason to improve his reads, sharpen his pocket presence and grow with a stronger roster around him, suggesting an upward trajectory.</p><h3>So what's Maye's actual potential?</h3><p>Taking a second quarterback feels unnecessary in many leagues, but Maye's profile breaks that mold.</p><p>Maye's rookie per-game production already bordered on QB1 territory. With an improved line, better playmakers and a system that leverages his skills, a breakout season is well within reach. A game with 250 passing yards, two touchdowns and 60 rushing yards would net 24 fantasy points -- well above the 20.9 average of last season's top-10 fantasy quarterbacks. Mix in a couple of spike weeks against weak defenses, and Maye could easily find himself in top-10 territory.</p><p>The second-year QB offers a safe rushing floor and exciting passing upside, all at a late-round price. That makes him one of the smartest targets at quarterback in 2025.</p>\n</div></div>"

As he waited for the group in front of him to finish, behind the grandstands a giant cloud sporting a frightening shade of gray loomed. A hole earlier, Scheffler had been washed by sunlight and framed by a rainbow. Now, the sun was gone and it looked like more rain could be coming.</p><p>It was that kind of day in Northern Ireland at the Open Championship.</p><p>\"When we were teeing off, depending on what weather forecast you looked at, it was going to tell you something different,\" Scheffler said. \"It was super sunny when we were on the driving range, I'm out there in short sleeves, it's warm out. Then we get to the first hole, it's still sunny. Then all of a sudden, you look around and it's super dark and it starts pouring rain. You're like, boy, I wonder how long this is going to last.\"</p><p>Through pouring rain, wind or sunshine, Scheffler was unfazed. He birdied the first hole under the conditions -- a harbinger of what was to come.</p><p>Over the course of the afternoon, the best player in the world did what he has now done many times: made his victory feel inevitable. In his second spin around Portrush, Scheffler continued to lead the field in approach and went on to make over 132 feet of putts, tally eight birdies and shoot what felt like an easy 64 to take the 36-hole lead at 10-under.</p><p>\"I felt like I hit a few more fairways than I did yesterday,\" Scheffler said, stating the obvious. \"Hit some really nice iron shots, and was able to hole some putts.\"</p><p>This kind of understated, matter-of-fact nature to Scheffler's demeanor has become common. It's why the best and most honest assessment of Scheffler's greatness can often be found not with him but with the very people who are trying to beat him.</p><p>On Friday, when one reporter prefaced a question to <a data-player-guid=\"81036860-da90-8d9e-be1e-38fdfff557fc\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4587/shane-lowry\">Shane Lowry</a>, who played with Scheffler, about being on the fringes of contention, Lowry chuckled.</p><p>\"Eight shots behind Scottie Scheffler isn't in the fringes of contention the way he's playing,\" he said.</p><p>Earlier in the day, <a data-player-guid=\"65575c5e-0ef2-9f58-6495-42da8638a332\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/3470/rory-mcilroy\">Rory McIlroy</a> finished his second round at 3-under and made a point to say he was only five back of the leaders which, at the time, were <a data-player-guid=\"53a8100d-5131-cad6-20ed-b07bd3e7c1ce\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/1225/brian-harman\">Brian Harman</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"f407b075-96bc-e0d7-7e69-6eef7abf0c48\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9221/haotong-li\">Haotong Li</a> at 8-under.</p><p>Be it one shot like <a data-player-guid=\"a11204a7-ef27-3f00-a28e-358ee5984e77\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9037/matt-fitzpatrick\">Matt Fitzpatrick</a>, seven shots like McIlroy or anything in between, any deficit against Scheffler has a different feel to it, especially when he's not just excelling at his normal superpower (he's No. 1 in strokes gained: approach), but has seemingly tapped into a new one with his putter (he's No. 2 in strokes gained: putting).</p><p>\"He's an exceptional player. He's World No. 1,\" Fitzpatrick, who will be Scheffler's playing partner in the last group Saturday, said. \"We're seeing Tiger-like stuff.\"</p><p>When asked what it feels like to be in contention, Fitzpatrick raved about the feeling before realizing that the guy he'll be contending with is likely now used to this sensation.</p><p>He laughed. \"It must be fantastic for Scottie.\"</p><p>Even though Scheffler may feel inevitable, this is still The Open, and there's something different about holding on to leads on courses that require something beyond target practice.</p><p>Here, professional golf is at its most inclusive. Here, the ball rolls, the bunkers swallow, the crosswinds confuse and the potential lies terrorize. The formula to succeed can be simple in theory, but endlessly complex in execution. Distance is no longer the be-all and end-all; strategy is. How far a player may hit the ball is no longer an indication of how well a player may do at a given tournament, but merely a means to the most important end: Get the ball in the hole.</p><p>Just take a look at Harman. While a player like Fitzpatrick has made a name for speed training and gaining distance despite his slight frame, the Georgia native stands 5-foot-7, hits it about 275 yards off the tee and was able to win the 2023 Open Championship at Royal Liverpool by simply keeping the ball in front of him.</p><p>Harman is back, and this time he's coming for another Open with the same recipe.</p><p>\"I feel really comfortable over here,\" Harman said. \"I think that places like this force you to be a little bit more creative. It's not so much of an aerial attack. There's probably 10 different types of clubs, irons, drivers, woods that you can hit off the tee. There's different ways to attack into the green, and there's almost always a hill that will kind of kill a shot coming into the green. I just enjoy the creativity and trying to think your way around. You don't necessarily -- you're not forced to hit certain shots. You can kind of do it your own way.\"</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>Aside from Scheffler, who is becoming even more of a constant presence no matter the kind of course, there seems to be no one-size-fits-all approach to this tournament. Just look at the leaderboard: Both McIlroy and 52-year-old <a data-player-guid=\"2f24c1d2-7845-598a-27c9-40cec10d8ef7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/455/lee-westwood\">Lee Westwood</a> are just outside the top 10, seven shots behind Scheffler. One has struggled to hit the fairway, the other has hit the most fairways in the field so far even if he can't hit it nearly as far as his competitors.</p><p>There's a journeyman of the DP World Tour in Li (8-under) and there are two DP World Tour graduates who share a last name and the potential to be stars in Nicolai Hojgaard (4-under) and his brother Rasmus (5-under). Both are inside the top 10, too.</p><p>There's <a data-player-guid=\"ab95205e-c964-97c7-c309-9841844bc546\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5553/tyrrell-hatton\">Tyrrell Hatton</a>, who is coming off contending at the U.S Open, and <a data-player-guid=\"91d5d02c-4522-7ce1-435e-f50c8666ea82\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/2230/tony-finau\">Tony Finau</a>, who hasn't won a PGA Tour event in two years and has missed the cut at the past two Open Championships. And then, there's Fitzpatrick, who, on paper, may be the biggest threat in keeping Scheffler away from the Claret Jug.</p><p>\"I felt like every facet of my game was on today,\" said Fitzpatrick, who won the 2022 U.S. Open at Brookline.</p><p>Of course, elite ballstriking is the bedrock on which any winning bid will be made at Portrush -- just look at the fact that <a data-player-guid=\"59d0d68c-2508-43cf-782c-8f649e786114\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/11378/robert-macintyre\">Robert MacIntyre</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"91d6bef0-8a59-459a-04ed-11121ff3d5e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/5408/harris-english\">Harris English</a> are also inside the top 10. But the reason why it can't be a case closed for Scheffler 36 holes in isn't so much about who surrounds him, but more about what this tournament can do to a player.</p><p>Trouble is just around every nook. A pot bunker here, out of bounds there, or the menacing gores that often look closer to the fairways and greens than they are. As Scheffler experienced Friday, the weather forecast is a guessing game, and stepping up to any tee, you never know what kind of wind or rain you're going to get. You also never know what kind of winner the links will crown. No one expected Harman to win in 2023.</p><p>\"I think the pressure is for him to win the golf tournament,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I wouldn't say I necessarily feel as much pressure. He's going to have the expectation to go out and dominate.\"</p><p>Fitzpatrick is right. But even though Scheffler will be chased by many starting Saturday, his biggest rival may be this tournament itself. It's the one major he has performed the worst at in his career, relatively speaking, and because of its style, it's also the one that will likely be the toughest to hold on to.</p><p>All eyes will be on Scheffler, who will further the Tiger comparisons once again if he does hang on for the win. The last player to win an Open with a 36-hole lead was Woods in 2006. At the time, Woods, like Scheffler, was the No. 1 player in the world; at the time, Woods also felt inevitable.</p><p>\"We'll see what the weekend brings,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"There's still a hell of a long way to go,\"</p>\n</div></div>"

But I just think it’s really hard and you might stuff your chances at both. So I don’t know. A lot of people can have their opinion but there’s very few that have actually done it. I’d like to see what Kelly has to say about it.”</p><p>There is an additional factor. Shorn of her training partner, and Olympic champion, Keely Hodgkinson – who is expected to return from a hamstring injury in the coming weeks – 800m times have somewhat stagnated. By contrast, increasing numbers of 1500m women continue to break new ground.</p><p>“You’ve got to look strategically at the events,” said Hunter Bell. “The 1500m has got even faster than last year. I didn’t think that was possible, but it has again. Whereas the 800m, at the moment, is not as fast as it was last year. So if you’re trying to get a medal, what is actually the best thing to do?”</p><p>Elsewhere, the anticipated battle of the British runners failed to materialise in the men’s 1500m as the young Kenyan upstart Phanuel Koech upset the 60,000-strong sellout crowd by outkicking reigning world champion Josh Kerr in the home straight to claim victory.</p><figure id=\"f109d6dd-5d7b-4e36-8dcf-abd218d6c80c\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Phanuel Koech runs away from Josh Kerr in the final straight to win the men’s 1500m\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cca8c5b2264cbc7dfdb4b64241428e1bb44998b/492_91_4058_3247/master/4058.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"356.0657959586003\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Phanuel Koech runs away from Josh Kerr in the final straight to win the men’s 1500m.</span> Photograph: Javier García/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>Koech, 18, had never run a 1500m race before last month, but now owns three of the six fastest times in the world this year after triumphing in a meeting record of 3:28.82.

Who are the big names to watch at the trade deadline (July 31 at 6 p.m. ET)? What's the latest buzz on the biggest free agent? And which teams and storylines will rule the second half? Here's everything we heard during the festivities in Atlanta.</p><hr><h2>Who will be the biggest name to move at the MLB trade deadline?</h2><p><strong>Jeff Passan: </strong>Now that Boston is firmly in playoff contention, <a data-player-guid=\"b28542aa-30be-6851-75c4-501226976e1c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34886/alex-bregman\">Alex Bregman</a> is almost certainly off the table.

Which leaves the biggest name as ... the guy with the worst ERA in MLB among all pitchers with at least 90 innings. And yet <a data-player-guid=\"c5b4a3d3-4a7f-24f0-c1cb-0bcc9a0b967f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35241/sandy-alcantara\">Sandy Alcantara</a>, he of the 7.22 ERA, remains a target for teams thanks to the quality of his stuff and paucity of big available names.</p><p>Some teams see Alcantara's contract as too big an impediment and complain that the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"74909d10-eacb-1376-ef1e-d0f37d7c67ca\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mia/miami-marlins\">Miami Marlins</a> want too much in return for him. That's fine. Teams are twitchy. They crave upside. With the deadline creeping ever closer, the prospect of a team surveying the starting-pitching landscape and being willing to give up real talent for Alcantara's upside is tangible. Perhaps Alcantara is packaged with another Marlin to give the acquiring club a modicum of stability amid questions of whether the former NL Cy Young winner can be fixed.</p><p><strong>Buster Olney: </strong>The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"43e14a76-ff66-49ed-24fc-2835932f99dd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> have indicated to other teams that they will probably be dealers -- and assuming that's how it plays out, they will be a central player leading up to this year's trade deadline.

We're going to do everything we possibly can to improve ourselves and try to match up.\" He also made his objectives plain. The Yankees will prioritize pitching, first in the rotation then in the bullpen with a reliever or two, followed by an infielder, preferably a third baseman to upgrade over <a data-player-guid=\"f81662c0-606d-3f03-a79c-fde5e26b5eee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42479/oswald-peraza\">Oswald Peraza</a>. Checking off all those boxes will not be simple, but Cashman appears willing to operate aggressively to tangibly bolster the roster and give the Yankees a real shot to return to the World Series -- and not waste another magnificent <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a> season. That could mean making everyone in the farm system besides top prospect George Lombard Jr. available.</p><p>As for the Mets, the bullpen is atop the checklist, and adding a starter and center fielder is possible. The relief corps has faced two obstacles: Injuries and heavy usage caused by the rotation ranking 22nd in the majors in innings pitched. All-Star closer <a data-player-guid=\"1483dd31-f9d6-ba75-5ca9-05210ae1cf00\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35394/edwin-diaz\">Edwin Diaz</a> was consistently dominant, but other pillars, including <a data-player-guid=\"0ecaa584-9532-5e75-a63a-cfc78cb37e85\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36526/reed-garrett\">Reed Garrett</a> (39 appearances), <a data-player-guid=\"ebfb01b1-0078-0dc9-6fc9-a9a5a30c4b6b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33301/ryne-stanek\">Ryne Stanek</a> (37) and Huascar Brazobán (39), have stumbled in spots.

Otherwise, center field is an obvious position to upgrade if David Stearns finds a price he's comfortable paying.</p><p><strong>Jesse Rogers: </strong> There isn't much mystery to the Yankees. Brian Cashman could use a reliever and a third baseman followed by starting pitching coming in third among his needs.

The Mets are also looking for bullpen help, considering their injuries on the mound.</p><p><strong>Olney:</strong> The Mets' rotation could be in its best state in the coming weeks, with Sean Manaea now back, so they probably wouldn't make a deal for starting pitching depth. But if there's a trade to be made for someone who could start the first three games of a postseason series (which is the way that some evaluators distinguish starting pitchers at this time of year), the Mets could be interested in someone like <a data-player-guid=\"015860e5-bef1-87ae-e3c9-9ca7806418c2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32968/merrill-kelly\">Merrill Kelly</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"fc1345d7-f487-a73d-b74a-5c781b21d2d1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39910/zac-gallen\">Zac Gallen</a>, who could be two of the best starting pitchers moved before the deadline.</p><p>One evaluator believes that <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"11a5df00-0945-35a5-66fe-a3a107975558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-royals\">Kansas City Royals</a> starter <a data-player-guid=\"701f498a-81c2-4742-4511-0c17889754e4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34873/seth-lugo\">Seth Lugo</a> (who started his career with the Mets) is a natural target for the Mets or Yankees, as they're both big-market teams with resources to burn and a potential willingness to overpay.</p><p>However, rival execs say the hallmark of president of baseball operations David Stearns' work is that he won't overpay early, but rather, he will wait for something more reasonable to emerge. \"In the end,\" said one executive with another team, \"he'll make multiple trades that improve the team -- deals that might not be the splashiest, but good deals.\"</p><p>The Mets will track the center-field options closely, with that position being the most obvious spot to upgrade. Could Baltimore's <a data-player-guid=\"17b3c50b-a649-3114-a474-3f678d75563a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35578/cedric-mullins\">Cedric Mullins</a> represent an upgrade?

These are questions to be answered in the Mets' front office.</p><hr><h2><strong>Which contenders will go really big at the deadline?</strong></h2><p><strong>Passan: </strong>The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a> need a starting pitcher. And while other teams' needs are more urgent -- the Phillies' bullpen, third base for the Yankees and plenty more -- the Cubs are in an extremely strong position.</p><p>They have the best run differential in baseball and the third-easiest schedule for the remainder of the season. Home-field advantage is within reach. The Cubs need a starter for innings, sure, but more than that because their playoff rotation at the moment has a gaping hole. <a data-player-guid=\"af1ec5d4-41a0-3097-9cb4-9e32ec6250a2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5134630/shota-imanaga\">Shota Imanaga</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"18179f89-dcb9-9d42-a7ec-99aa1c26c5fb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34401/matthew-boyd\">Matthew Boyd</a> have pitched their way into two spots, but Chicago needs a similar caliber starter who it simply doesn't have at the moment.</p><p><strong>Alden Gonzalez: </strong>The Phillies have championship hopes, an aging core, an ultra-aggressive front office and a clear need ahead of the trade deadline: bullpen help. Phillies relievers combined for a 4.38 ERA heading into the All-Star break, tied with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> for the seventh-highest mark in the major leagues.</p><p>Rival executives expect those two teams to be among the most aggressive in pursuit of high-leverage arms over these next few weeks.</p><p>Another team to watch is the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0151aed9-9f11-ceae-195d-180ca603b64a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a>, who surged to the top of the American League East with 25 wins in their last 38 games before the break. They didn't lavish <a data-player-guid=\"011563f3-5637-9d59-9629-2e6ff3c32b20\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35002/vladimir-guerrero-jr\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr</a>. with $500 million for nothing. They'll do whatever it takes to augment the group around him.</p><p><strong>Olney: </strong>There are a couple more interesting teams to watch. The Mariners' focus is on adding offense at first and third base. They had almost no payroll flexibility over the most recent offseason, but the perception is that they will have money to spend at this year's deadline -- and might prefer to take on some payroll rather than overpay in prospect capital. The Mariners, with a good farm system, would seem to have a lot of common denominators for deal-making with the Diamondbacks.</p><p>The Rays are typically one of the more creative clubs at the deadline, sometimes acquiring talent and sometimes trading it away -- and sometimes doing both. But news broke in recent days that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45741438/report-stu-sternberg-sell-tampa-bay-rays-17-billion\">the sale of the franchise is moving forward</a>, and there is a perception in other front offices that the Rays might be given the freedom (a wink-wink from incoming ownership) to be more aggressive than usual and spend money. But they have to play better to justify a move like that.</p><hr><h2><strong>What's the latest on Kyle Tucker's free agency?</strong></h2><p><strong>Rogers: </strong>It's quiet. Very quiet. His current team -- the Cubs -- is likely to come to him with a good offer at some point, but it probably won't be for max dollars. Then he'll likely hear from the big boys in free agency (minus the Mets, who signed <a data-player-guid=\"c0225b71-161d-fe89-5c62-d27fa64259fd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a> last offseason). From there, he will have a decision: Sign back up in Chicago where he looks comfortable or hit one of the coasts for the next megadeal. He could always keep a Cubs offer in his back pocket and circle back to them. One thing he has going for him: Cubs fans want him back.</p><hr><h2><strong>The team to beat in each league right now is ...?</strong></h2><p><strong>Gonzalez: </strong>The Dodgers, even still, for one clear reason: They entered the All-Star break with the National League's best record, and their best baseball might still be in front of them. <a data-player-guid=\"56c5b82d-6d6a-fcbb-234f-1822a821f15e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30193/freddie-freeman\">Freddie Freeman</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"84b5fdeb-d79c-dc9c-8023-5cad2a921ca4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33039/mookie-betts\">Mookie Betts</a> have not hit to their capabilities. <a data-player-guid=\"459f01d4-79d3-2e60-2427-fddc4a82f275\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33748/blake-snell\">Blake Snell</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"73885c08-1817-3726-f379-b0a479a92aae\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33190/tyler-glasnow\">Tyler Glasnow</a> are just now getting healthy again. <a data-player-guid=\"04a76996-4a5c-456d-8022-a9d45e3ff933\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> is in the early stages of being built back up as a starting pitcher.</p><p>The Dodgers might not challenge the regular-season wins record, but in the eyes of many throughout the sport, they also haven't done anything to make one believe they can't repeat as champions. It will come down to how they upgrade their bullpen and whether they can keep their starting pitchers healthy, something they have proved incapable of doing these past couple of years.</p><p><strong>Castillo: </strong>Right now, it's the Tigers -- though that could change after the trade deadline. Detroit has the best record in the league with the best pitcher in the league (<a data-player-guid=\"2e709af2-d8bb-3d70-978d-f33a50695c14\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42409/tarik-skubal\">Tarik Skubal</a>) leading one of the best rotations in the league, though adding a starter is within reason after <a data-player-guid=\"4ca95b34-3599-3c3b-aa05-1bd2edf4c4e8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4872647/jackson-jobe\">Jackson Jobe</a> was lost for the season and <a data-player-guid=\"e2abd1f8-f3bf-dc3a-3c27-4fe8c861bfb4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31086/alex-cobb\">Alex Cobb</a> still hasn't thrown a pitch in 2025. The offense, while without that one MVP-level superstar, had three All-Stars and ranks third in the American League with a 110 wRC+.</p><p>If there are areas that could use improvement for October, it's the bullpen and third base. Detroit relievers rank 11th in the AL in ERA and sixth in win probability added, and Tigers third basemen have combined for an 86 wRC+ this season. Even without bolstering those areas, the Tigers should run away with the AL Central and could earn home-field advantage throughout the postseason.</p><hr><h2><strong>What other intel did you hear during All-Star week?</strong></h2><p><strong>Olney:</strong> The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6ad8fa03-36bc-baab-c76a-345b6544424d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-guardians\">Cleveland Guardians</a> are ready to listen to offers for all but four players -- third baseman <a data-player-guid=\"ec9ea93f-b7c3-b30e-53a6-694d294e3438\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32801/jose-ramirez\">Jose Ramirez</a>, outfielder <a data-player-guid=\"ac85b3fc-6fa7-c2c2-d53f-9047b5a3e8f4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41996/steven-kwan\">Steven Kwan</a> and relievers <a data-player-guid=\"33727959-f665-abd8-6eb7-f30a26b8db65\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41743/emmanuel-clase\">Emmanuel Clase</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"8ad74cb8-30b2-35f6-a1b4-8f8b0bd00f4c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4987924/cade-smith\">Cade Smith</a>. Everyone else is available, with the Guardians hoping to get maximum value and find more offense.</p><p><strong>Rogers: </strong>Scouts are keeping a close eye on the Twins because Minnesota could have pitching to move in the coming weeks. The same can't be said of the Royals, who keep telling folks they aren't breaking up their team despite a middling record. AL Central teams are in a different position than they were a year ago when the division was up for grabs. Detroit will likely be the only team in the division to add anything of significance.</p><p><strong>Olney:</strong> The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4fa2cf46-09fc-255f-74a1-2a8857b0e671\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a> are among this deadline's mystery teams -- it's unclear whether they are dealing or acquiring. \"I think what they do coming out of the All-Star break is going to be really important,\" one evaluator said.

The Preakness Stakes winner was the runner-up at the Belmont Stakes his last time out, and he is returning to action as the 4-5 betting favorite in the Haskell Stakes 2025 odds. He has some familiar competition in the 2025 Haskell Stakes field, such as Preakness runner-up Gosger (9-2) and Toyota Blue Grass Stakes winner Burnham Square (5-1).

An on-air host and reporter who has provided racing analysis for TVG, HRTV and the Breeders' Cup, Yu has spent a lifetime in racing.

She started off 2025 by correctly going all-in on Citizen Bull to win the Robert B.

Big game players who were probably challenged by a good few.\"</p><p>Sione Tuipulotu, the first Scot to score a Lions Test try since Alan Tait in 1997, was of the same mind. \"In big games they perform when it counts,\" said the centre. </p><p>\"Tom was amazing, he's a joy to play with. I always look at him and he always looks so sore when he's running around, he always looks in pain but he just keeps going. Testament to him. The same with Tadhg.</p><p>\"They're two warriors of the game and they were a big reason why we won. Those two are like ball magnets. Wherever the ball is, they're in and around.\"</p><p>There's no doubt about their seismic contribution in Brisbane. Beirne made 23 tackles, won three turnovers - one inside the opening minute - and was world class.  Curry was just like a man possessed. Driven, aggressive, almost dangerous in his intensity, in the best possible sense.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>We went to interview Curry after the match and it was quite something. He didn't say much after his colossal night, but in a sense he'd said enough already. Not words, but actions. Thunderous, relentless and unyielding.</p><p>When he entered the mixed zone after what will go down as one of his finest 58 minutes of his career - the Lions were leading 24-5 when he went off - Curry was about as effusive as a rock.</p><p>Clearly, there's a beef there. Somebody has been in his ear, maybe filling his head with stuff to anger and inspire him. 'They've written you off Tom.' 'They don't think you deserve your place.' 'What message are you gonna send them on Saturday?'</p><p>Who was doing the writing off? It actually doesn't matter. His brother Ben - currently touring with England - <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2025/07/18/ben-curry-hits-out-lions-fans-tom-criticism-twin/\">lambasted the cyber warriors<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> for giving him stick that was \"gobsmacking\" and \"incredibly disappointing\".</p><p>Maybe Tom, himself, thought it was the journalists who'd been on his case. Certainly, there's been stuff said and written about him not quite being at his brilliant and belligerent best, but that's fair comment. He hasn't been. We're talking a very, very high bar here.</p><p>And, yes, there's been praise for Jac Morgan, who's had a good tour. Some observers would have had Morgan ahead of Curry. Many others would have said Curry's best stuff is other-worldly and he had to start.</p><p>Whatever was dripped into his ear, it worked. Real or invented - it doesn't matter. Curry was extraordinarily good on the pitch and spectacularly taciturn in the aftermath. Almost heroically stoic.</p><p>'How do you feel after that, Tom?'</p><p>\"Yeah, good.\"</p><p>'Happy with your performance?'</p><p>\"I was happy.\"</p><p>'Big hit [on James Slipper] at the start…</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>'Atmosphere was amazing, eh?'</p><p>\"Yep.\"</p><p>'Anything else on that, Tom?'</p><p>\"It was good.\"</p><p>'How close do you think that was to a world-class performance?'</p><p>\"I don't know what world class is. It's such a cliched thing, isn't it? I don't really care what label you put on it - you just have to win.\"</p><p>'How much more do you think you've got in you for next week?'</p><p>\"Loads.\"</p><p>'In what areas?'</p><p>\"Every area.\"</p><p>'That was your type of game, wasn't it?'</p><p>\"They're all my types of game.\"</p><p>'I don't know if you picked up on any criticism that maybe you weren't in peak form coming into this. Did you pick up on any of that?</p><p>\"No, nothing.\"</p><p>On it went, an occasional answer longer than a word or two, but not many, all delivered with a smile that hinted at something he wanted to say but wasn't going to. Because, again, he'd said everything he needed to say in his time on the field.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Whoever he thought had doubted him, he'd answered them. Curry is a hard man and a phenomenal rugby player. He drove into the guts of the Wallabies from the opening seconds at the Suncorp and delivered that moment that sent the Lions on their way.</p><p>In burying Slipper in the tackle and setting up Beirne to win a turnover penalty, a tone was set. Farrell referenced that later on. They were monstrously physical and the third member of that back row, Jack Conan, was right up there with them.</p><p>Curry went looking for victims, smashing Max Jorgensen, nailing Fraser McReight, taking out Tom Lynagh in the air and giving away a penalty -  a touch lucky not to get a yellow card - but Joe Schmidt had no major issue with it afterwards.</p><p>He scored a try as well, of course. After he left, the bottom started to fall out of the Lions performance. Was it complacency? Farrell said no. Was it a subconscious belief that the game had already been won when the Lions went 24-5 ahead early in the second half? Maro Itoje denied that.</p><p>It was just a drop-off in discipline, some bad decisions. \"That shouldn't happen,\" said Farrell. \"We talk about next-moment-focused at all times and that certainly shouldn't happen. We certainly need to address it. Subconsciously, I guess that tends to happen, not that it should.\"</p><p>Not that Itoje agreed with the subconscious point. \"I don't think so,\" he replied when asked about the switch-off at 24-5. \"I think we were a bit inaccurate with our decision-making and when you're not accurate with your decision-making against a good team you tend to put yourself under pressure. I think that's what happened in the second half.\"</p><p>That and Curry exiting the stage when the Lions were threatening to run amok and trouble the record books.</p><p>On this supposed criticism of Curry, you wonder if Farrell played on that. You wonder if he brought Curry and Beirne together and played with their minds a little, maybe exaggerated the extent of the barbs, maybe asked a question or two of them.</p><p>\"I wouldn't say they took it to heart,\" said Farrell. \"We have conversations on 'why do you think you're selected?' and 'what is it that you're going to bring to the team performance?' and to a man they're unbelievably honest. They're men of their word.\"</p><p>Meaning that whatever it was they told their coach they would produce they duly produced. Beirne spoke brilliantly later on. He covered all sorts of areas and delved into different issues with excellent perspectives. Curry went down a different road. It takes all sorts. He was stoic in the mixed zone but fantastically fluent in the language of Test match rugby.</p><p>Long may his critics - whoever and wherever they are - take potshots at him, because the put-downs make him rise up. Another display like this and he might well cement his place in Lions history in Melbourne next Saturday - and the disapproving voices, if they exist at all, will be silent at last.</p></div><div data-component=\"media-block\"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>More to come from Lions after opening win - Farrell</p></figcaption></figure></div><section data-component=\"links-block\"><p><h2 type=\"normal\">More on this story</h2></p><ul role=\"list\"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>"

      "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div>\n        \n        \n                            \n                \n        <p>Nothing can turn a highly drafted Fantasy selection into a 2025 Fantasy football bust quite like an injury. However, you can't always predict when injuries occur, but you can look at recent history to see which players are more prone to missed time than others. Jonathan Taylor has missed at least three games in each of the past three seasons, while Alvin Kamara's missed at least two games each of the last four years. So, if you go into your 2025 Fantasy football drafts with the expectation that they'll be out for a couple of weeks, then that could help you avoid reaching too early for players of this ilk.</p><p>Neither Taylor nor Kamara has a Fantasy football ADP 2025 that ranks among the top 10 running backs, so Fantasy owners appear to be catching on. Looking at a player's injury history is just one factor that should be done when crafting a Fantasy football strategy that will, hopefully, be a winning strategy. Before finalizing your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07082025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbusts\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>Last year, the model accurately predicted that Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert would fall well short of his ADP (RB23). The result: A season after rushing for over 1,000 yards and scoring 21 total touchdowns despite sharing time with De'Von Achane, Mostert fell out of favor in Miami and finished as RB60 after managing only 439 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.</p>\n        \n\n<p>The model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy Football sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking. The 2025 Fantasy football PPR rankings and 2025 Fantasy football standard rankings update multiple times daily, so you're always getting the best Fantasy football advice.</p><p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07082025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbusts\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football busts</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football busts the model is predicting: Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who has an ADP of 163. In 2024, he posted the most efficient season of his five-year career, with a career-high in passer rating and a career-low in interceptions. However, Jim Harbaugh and Greg Roman offenses are simply not catered towards huge passing numbers as Herbert's 227.6 passing yards per game were the fewest of his career. He also averaged the fewest passing touchdowns per game of his career, and one shouldn't expect those figures to take a big jump in 2025.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Many thought the Chargers would select a wideout in the first round to give Herbert a legitimate No. 1, but they instead drafted RB Omarion Hampton. Los Angeles also signed veteran Najee Harris as the run has, is and will always be the focal point under a Harbaugh-coached team. The Chargers ranked just 28th in pass attempts last season, and the lack of volume limits Herbert's upside. Thus, the model sees him as a Fantasy football 2025 bust and ranks him outside the top 15 Fantasy quarterbacks.</p><p>Another bust that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701883/marvin-harrison-jr/fantasy/\">Marvin Harrison Jr</a>, who has an over/under of 975.5 receiving yards this year. In the grand scheme of things, 62 catches for 886 yards and eight touchdowns is a solid rookie season. However, expectations were a bit higher than that for the namesake of a Pro Football Hall-of-Famer who was drafted No. 4 overall and landed with an organization where he was the clear-cut No. 1 WR.</p><p>Now expectations are that he'll take a step forward -- which is certainly possible -- but there are some concerning peripherals here. He finished 70th among NFL receivers in yards after catch (148) and 107th in average target separation (1.03 yards). Harrison is one of the first 20 wide receivers being drafted so far this season, but the model ranks him comfortably outside the top 20 behind fellow fifth and sixth-round receivers like D.J. Moore, DK Metcalf and Xavier Worthy.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07082025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbusts\" target=\"_blank\">See which other Fantasy football busts 2025 to pick here</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankings</h2><p>SportsLine is also fading one of the first five running backs off the board in early 2025 Fantasy football drafts.

Replays showed, however, that he dug up a second ball on his followthrough that was embedded in the ground just in front of his golf ball.</p><p>McIlroy was as stunned as anyone else over the bizarre sequence, picking up the second ball and having a bit of a laugh at the insanity of the moment. McIlroy's actual ball ended up landing well short of the green, and he failed to get up-and-down for par, dropping his first shot of the day to go back to 5 under. He was suddenly seven shots off the lead again.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n\n\n<p>McIlroy got off to a hot start to his third round at the 2025 Open Championship, making three birdies in his first four holes to send the Northern Ireland crowd into a frenzy. From that point, things got a bit scratchy for McIlroy; he missed a few opportunities and had a few wayward tee shots that kept him from continuing his charge up the leaderboard.&nbsp;</p><p>The tough break leading to a bogey on No. 11 -- which followed what seemed to be a great break to avoid the gorse bushes off a wayward tee shot -- seemed to end any real hopes of contending on Sunday. However, the golf gods decided to give him one back on the 12th as he rolled in a long eagle putt to jump to 7 under and create a massive roar from the home crowd.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><em>Be sure to follow along with <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">live leaderboard updates and highlights from Round 3</a></span> on Saturday at the 2025 Open Championship.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n        \n            </div>\n\n    </div></div>"

Each card contains world title fights and big names, with fights ranging from <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-318-dustin-poirier-vs-max-holloway-3-fight-card-odds-start-time-location-date-complete-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Oleksandr Usyk vs. Daniel Dubois for the undisputed heavyweight championship</a></span> to <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/manny-pacquiao-vs-mario-barrios-fight-card-date-odds-ppv-price-start-time-location-complete-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Manny Pacquiao ending his retirement at 46</a></span> to fight Mario Barrios for the WBC welterweight championship.&nbsp;</p><p>Usyk is looking to become undisputed heavyweight champion for the second time in his career. Usyk was stripped of the IBF title after becoming undisputed with his first win over Tyson Fury due to the IBF's rules that forced Usyk to choose between his contractually mandated rematch with Fury or face a mandatory IBF challenger. Once the IBF title was vacant, Dubois was promoted from interim to full champion. Usyk won the first meeting with Dubois by knockout and is favored heading into the rematch.</p><p>Pacquiao has not fought professionally since 2021, when he lost a WBA welterweight title fight with Yordenis Ugas. He faces not only a significant age and ring rust disadvantage to Barrios, but also will be the much smaller man in the ring. Barrios was promoted from interim to full champion and has successfully defended the title once with a draw against Abel Ramos.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/why-manny-pacquiao-believes-that-even-at-46-an-upset-could-be-brewing-against-mario-barrios-on-saturday/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Why Manny Pacquiao believes that, even at 46, an upset could be brewing against Mario Barrios on Saturday</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brian Campbell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Why Manny Pacquiao believes that, even at 46, an upset could be brewing against Mario Barrios on Saturday\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/16/04712343-0d36-4266-8a85-fc6e0f37ab2f/thumbnail/270x152/140f1efd689d61f5a29e55cc12f7ca1f/manny-pacquiao-camp-smile.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>With all of those fights, plus plenty on each undercard, there is sure to be some interest in betting at various <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\">sportsbooks</a>. We've taken a look at the best bets for many fights across the three cards. We have a 9-2 record on boxing best bets for 2025. Let's take a look at our picks. As always, our picks are -250 or better.</p><p><em>Odds via <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>.</em></p><h2>Oleksandr Usyk vs. Daniel Dubois</h2><p><strong>Usyk via decision (+170)</strong></p><p>The oddsmakers have shaded this fight to not go the distance (-136). Personally, I think it's more likely the fight goes the full 12 rounds. Both fighters know how dangerous the other is, and though Usyk finished Dubois in the first fight, Dubois has a booming level of confidence coming off of his thrashing of Anthony Joshua. Usyk only has two stoppages at heavyweight (Dubois and Chazz Witherspoon) and I don't see a repeat of the first fight here. Usyk is the better boxer and those skills should be enough for him to come out on top on the scorecards, though either man getting a stoppage is in play.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Mario Barrios vs. Manny Pacquiao</h2><p><strong>Barrios via KO/TKO/DQ (+135)</strong></p><p>Pacquiao winning would be a great story that would only build on his legendary career. But we're talking about a 46-year-old man who is returning from years of being retired and who was on the downside of his career when he hung up his gloves the first time. Pacquiao looks to be in great shape, but translating that to success against a younger, bigger fighter who has been active in big fights is simply too big of an ask. Expect Pacquiao to show a few flashes early before Barrios gets rolling. Once Barrios is doing his thing, there's going to be a time when Pacquiao either gets stopped or his team will need to stop the fight for him.</p><h2>Sebastian Fundora vs. Tim Tszyu</h2><p><strong>Tim Tszyu moneyline (-155)</strong></p><p>This fight on the Barrios vs. Pacquiao undercard may be the best of the weekend. Fundora won their first fight, outlasting Tszyu in a bloody war. Tszyu was badly affected by a cut caused by an accidental Fundora elbow that left blood streaming in Tszyu's eyes for nearly the entire fight. Prior to the cut, Tszyu was landing big shots on Fundora and seemed to be in control of the fight. Fundora switched to a more jab-based attack down the stretch, using his incredible reach to keep Tszyu at a distance. But that's not how Fundora fights traditionally, and Tszyu should be able to get inside and do the work he was doing early in the first fight. This should be a good fight but it's one Tszyu has every chance to win.</p><h2>Jesse Rodriguez vs. Phumelela Cafu</h2><p><strong>Under 7.5 rounds (-115)</strong></p><p>Rodriguez should run away with this fight. Cafu has only fought outside of South Africa once and never against anyone nearly as skilled as Rodriguez. Also, Cafu has had five of his 14 pro fights end in either a draw or a split decision, which shows he hasn't been able to put his stamp on fights even at lower levels. Rodriguez is a dynamic fighter who has beaten truly good fighters. Rodriguez is a -3000 favorite and -400 to win by stoppage. That leaves under 7.5 rounds as the best available bet to keep with our rules of -250 odds or better. Look for Rodriguez not to waste time in taking the fight right to Cafu.</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Who wins Mario Barrios vs. Manny Pacquiao</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and which method of victory prop could bring a massive return?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/manny-pacquiao-vs-mario-barrios-accomplished-boxing-analyst-reveals-selections-for-july-19-welterweight-title-fight/#ttag=071825_agg_cbssports_picks_boxing_other_JoshNagel_MarioBarriosMannyPacquiao\" target=\"_blank\">Join SportsLine here to see which bets you need to make for the fight</a>, all from the accomplished veteran combat sports analyst who has consistently delivered winners.</strong></p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Her double in Milton Keynes ended France’s run and continued her streak of scoring in every game she played in the tournament. Kadidiatou Diani led France’s response, her shot rebounding off the post and in off the goalkeeper Merle Frohms. A stunning save from Pauline Peyraud-Magnin kept France in it, and the defending was admirable, but Popp’s unstoppable header proved the difference.<br><br><strong>Germany 2-1 France, 7 October 2022, Dresden</strong><br><br>\\n Germany kicked off their World Cup preparations with a show of strength in Dresden. Before kick-off, players huddled around Giulia Gwinn’s shirt - a nod to their injured teammate – and channelled that spirit into a dominant display. Popp rose for her 60th international goal, then slid in a second. France pulled one back from the spot, but Germany’s defence held firm. Surrounded by flags and home support, they looked sharp, united and ready.<br><br><strong>France 2-1 Germany, 23 February 2024, Lyon </strong><br><br>\\n France ended a five-year drought against Germany in front of a record 30,000 crowd in Lyon, edging a fierce Nations League semi-final. Diani opened with a thunderous strike from the edge of the box, before Sakina Karchaoui added a second from the spot. Germany pulled one back through Gwinn’s penalty, with Popp driving them forward, but France held on for a long-overdue win.</p>&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;0fda5d5f-2ada-4baf-b958-0cfab07e4109&quot;}],&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;pinned&quot;:false,&quot;keyEvent&quot;:true,&quot;summary&quot;:false},&quot;blockCreatedOn&quot;:1752926703000,&quot;blockCreatedOnDisplay&quot;:&quot;13.05&nbsp;BST&quot;,&quot;blockLastUpdated&quot;:1752926909000,&quot;blockLastUpdatedDisplay&quot;:&quot;13.08&nbsp;BST&quot;,&quot;blockFirstPublished&quot;:1752926909000,&quot;blockFirstPublishedDisplay&quot;:&quot;13.08&nbsp;BST&quot;,&quot;blockFirstPublishedDisplayNoTimezone&quot;:&quot;13.08&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;France v Germany: last three meetings&quot;,&quot;contributors&quot;:[],&quot;primaryDateLine&quot;:&quot;Sat 19 Jul 2025 17.44 BST&quot;,&quot;secondaryDateLine&quot;:&quot;First published on Sat 19 Jul 2025 10.00 BST&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;687b70928f08dbd6c5293113&quot;,&quot;elements&quot;:[{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p><strong>Esme Morgan says England are “very optimistic that Leah will be fine”</strong> for Tuesday’s semi-final, when asked about the chances of Leah Williamson playing v Italy.</p>&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;329abaa8-998c-4149-8f80-e4bb4d6c93bd&quot;}],&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;pinned&quot;:false,&quot;keyEvent&quot;:true,&quot;summary&quot;:false},&quot;blockCreatedOn&quot;:1752920210000,&quot;blockCreatedOnDisplay&quot;:&quot;11.16&nbsp;BST&quot;,&quot;blockLastUpdated&quot;:1752925013000,&quot;blockLastUpdatedDisplay&quot;:&quot;12.36&nbsp;BST&quot;,&quot;blockFirstPublished&quot;:1752920298000,&quot;blockFirstPublishedDisplay&quot;:&quot;11.18&nbsp;BST&quot;,&quot;blockFirstPublishedDisplayNoTimezone&quot;:&quot;11.18&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;England optimistic over Williamson fitness&quot;,&quot;contributors&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Tom Garry&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/06/19/Tom_Garry.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8a5187a3dadb4ad089f0179dcfc4e92e&quot;,&quot;largeImageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/06/19/Tom_Garry.png?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=924a4538601246b96a8f22c267efe0a6&quot;}],&quot;primaryDateLine&quot;:&quot;Sat 19 Jul 2025 17.44 BST&quot;,&quot;secondaryDateLine&quot;:&quot;First published on Sat 19 Jul 2025 10.00 BST&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;6879409e8f08dbd6c529206b&quot;,&quot;elements&quot;:[{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>Hello, good morning and welcome to another Euro 2025 Matchday live!

Her double in Milton Keynes ended France’s run and continued her streak of scoring in every game she played in the tournament. Kadidiatou Diani led France’s response, her shot rebounding off the post and in off the goalkeeper Merle Frohms. A stunning save from Pauline Peyraud-Magnin kept France in it, and the defending was admirable, but Popp’s unstoppable header proved the difference.</p><p><strong>Germany 2-1 France, 7 October 2022, Dresden</strong></p><p>\n Germany kicked off their World Cup preparations with a show of strength in Dresden. Before kick-off, players huddled around Giulia Gwinn’s shirt - a nod to their injured teammate – and channelled that spirit into a dominant display. Popp rose for her 60th international goal, then slid in a second. France pulled one back from the spot, but Germany’s defence held firm. Surrounded by flags and home support, they looked sharp, united and ready.</p><p><strong>France 2-1 Germany, 23 February 2024, Lyon </strong></p><p>\n France ended a five-year drought against Germany in front of a record 30,000 crowd in Lyon, edging a fierce Nations League semi-final. Diani opened with a thunderous strike from the edge of the box, before Sakina Karchaoui added a second from the spot. Germany pulled one back through Gwinn’s penalty, with Popp driving them forward, but France held on for a long-overdue win.</p></div></article><article id=\"block-687b87068f0826202a136110\"><header></header><p><strong>Germany take on France tonight</strong> for a place in the semi-finals.

The second half began Friday, and in only 12 days, the trade deadline will be upon us. Expect trade chatter and activity to pick up <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">now that the amateur draft is in the rearview mirror</a>&nbsp;and front offices can focus their attention on the deadline. Here are Saturday's trade deadline rumblings. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/\">Guardians</a> listening on relievers</h2>\n<p>The Guardians are listening to offers for their relievers, including <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3107591/emmanuel-clase/\">Emmanuel Clase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837519/cade-smith/\">Cade Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jonheyman.bsky.social/post/3lud6qsabes2o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports the New York Post</a>. The asking prices are high and it is not considered likely that either player will be moved. At 47-49, Cleveland is 4 ½ games behind the third wild-card spot. They have one of baseball's easiest remaining schedules, <a href=\"https://www.fangraphs.com/standings/playoff-odds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">per FanGraphs</a>, and aren't certain to sell.</p><p>Late-inning relievers are always in demand at the trade deadline and the Guardians would be doing themselves a disservice if they didn't at least listen to offers for every player on their roster. Relievers are volatile, even the very best ones, and you never know when a team will blow you away with an offer. Smith is under team control through 2029. Clase's contract can run through 2028.</p><h2> \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a>&nbsp;getting calls about Matz</h2>\n<p>Teams are showing interest in Cardinals lefty <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2107839/steven-matz/\">Steven Matz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/sports/professional/mlb/cardinals/video_ad5fcb78-e859-5afe-9e92-f9d5de06175f.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>. St. Louis is also likely to at least consider offers for righty relievers <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211752/ryan-helsley/\">Ryan Helsley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2693484/phil-maton/\">Phil Maton</a>. Helsley, Maton, and Matz will all be free agents after the season. The Cardinals are 51-47 and 2 ½ games behind the third wild-card spot, so they are in the postseason race. </p>\n        \n\n<p>Now 34, Matz has had a terrific season with St. Louis as a multi-inning reliever, thanks mainly to his ability to limit walks and hard contact in the air. He's gotten at least four outs in 21 of his 28 appearances and at least five outs 16 times. This is the final season of Matz's four-year, $44 million contract. He will still be owed $4 million or so after the trade deadline. </p><h2> \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a> interested in Coulombe </h2>\n<p>The Mets have an interest in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Twins</a> lefty <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2120231/danny-coulombe/\">Danny Coulombe</a>, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/07/17/sports/the-trio-of-prospects-the-mets-want-to-keep-out-of-any-trade-deadline-swings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports the New York Post</a>. Lefty <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2000754/brooks-raley/\">Brooks Raley</a> returned from Tommy John surgery Friday and is the only matchup southpaw in New York's bullpen now that a lat strain has ended&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2449982/a-j-minter/\">A.J. Minter</a>'s season. Coulombe, 35, has a 0.68 ERA with 29 strikeouts in 26 ⅔ innings this year. He is on a one-year, $3 million contract. </p><p>Bullpen help figures to be a priority for the Mets, who haven't had the most reliable bridge to ace closer <span>Edwin Díaz</span>. Also, the path through the NL in October goes through lefty hitters <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1630079/freddie-freeman/\">Freddie Freeman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2901324/shohei-ohtani/\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765813/bryce-harper/\">Bryce Harper</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135243/kyle-schwarber/\">Kyle Schwarber</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184352/kyle-tucker/\">Kyle Tucker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615365/pete-crow-armstrong/\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>, among others. A second lefty reliever is a necessity more than a luxury. </p>\n        \n\n<h2> \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> bring in Turnbull </h2>\n<p>The Cubs are signing veteran righty <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2167350/spencer-turnbull/\">Spencer Turnbull</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/JonHeyman/status/1946242091366916467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to the New York Post</a>. The deal is not yet official and it is unclear if Turnbull will join Chicago's major-league roster or report to Triple-A on a minor-league deal. Turnbull, 32, allowed five runs in 6 ⅓ innings spanning three appearances with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Blue Jays</a> last month. They released him on June 27. The Cubs are without three starting pitchers (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910632/javier-assad/\">Javier Assad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211224/justin-steele/\">Justin Steele</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765806/jameson-taillon/\">Jameson Taillon</a>), and, if nothing else, Turnbull can soak up innings as a long reliever. </p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

He was 72. A cause of death was not immediately disclosed.</p><p>Anderson made history as the only person in Clemson football to earn first-team All-ACC honors as a player and later serve as a full-time assistant on a national championship staff. Anderson played at Clemson from 1972–74, starting 31 of 33 games at middle guard and linebacker. His final game in a Tigers uniform -- a 39–21 victory over rival South Carolina in 1974 -- became one of the most memorable performances in program history. He tallied 21 tackles, including 17 solo stops. The 21 tackles still stand as the most in a single game by a Clemson defensive lineman.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/lsu-clemson-among-10-high-powered-college-football-offenses-guaranteed-to-produce-fireworks-in-2025-season/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>LSU, Clemson among 10 high-powered college football offenses guaranteed to produce fireworks in 2025 season</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brad Crawford                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"LSU, Clemson among 10 high-powered college football offenses guaranteed to produce fireworks in 2025 season\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/01/83bc9d91-d341-4809-acc7-1efdbfe42b4c/thumbnail/270x152/29d778fa879668cedeb4cb3ea886f976/cade.png\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Anderson signed a free-agent deal with the then-Oakland Raiders before continuing his professional career with the Birmingham Vulcans of the World Football League.

And for one of the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> leading pass rushers, he's fine with that because he knows there's going to be a pot of gold at some point in the near future given the value he has provided to the franchise.</p><p>Parsons said this week \"ownership is always going (to) make it drag out, make it more complicated than it has to be\" <a href=\"https://x.com/FieldYates/status/1945816496111853791\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">during an interview with The Undertaker</a>. That's a barb tossed in the direction of Jerry Jones, who dismissed the importance of agent David Mulugheta, who represents Parsons, amid extension talks.</p><p>Jones said he doesn't view contract negotiations with Parsons as urgent and said the deal ultimately needs to work for both sides -- the Cowboys and Parsons, downplaying the role Mulugheta will play in the final decision.</p><p>\"I know that I've spent five, six hours with (Parsons) myself and had a lot of discussions. Most of the issues are in agreement, and I've discussed it all,\" Jones&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/jonmachota/status/1907094376272015496\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said, via The Athletic,</a>&nbsp;at the NFL's annual league meetings this spring. \"We obviously don't have an agreement relative to a new contract. Micah is under contract. So we'll see how that goes. It's not uncommon for me to visit directly with players, and in this particular case, that's what I'm doing.\"</p>\n        \n\n<p>Parsons said this week he was told last offseason that Dallas was prioritizing new deals for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lamb/\">CeeDee Lamb</a> before pushing his request to the front burner.</p><p>Parsons pointed to other contracts as the basis for what he expects from the Cowboys. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139869/myles-garrett/\">Myles Garrett</a> agreed to a four-year extension averaging <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-myles-garrett-agree-to-record-four-year-contract-extension-deal-averages-40-million-per-year/\" target=\"_blank\">$40 million annually from the Cleveland Browns in March</a></span>, while the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> agreed this week to make edge rusher <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071793/t-j-watt/\">T.J.

He has registered at least 12 sacks in each of his four seasons, is a four-time Pro Bowl selections and has earned two First Team All-Pro nods.</p><p>\"I'm just going to get mine no matter what,\" Parsons told&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/sports/2025/07/micah-parsons-opens-up-about-contract-talks-with-cowboys-im-going-to-get-mine.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">PennLive during a youth football camp this week</a>. \"You know what I mean?

Like, each player, a high-paid player, takes a percentage of the salary cap. So, it's not really the number. It goes off by the salary cap.\"</p><p>Jones said previously that he has kept an open line of communication with Parsons this offseason, and <a href=\"https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/jerry-jones-micah-parsons-have-agreed-on-most-contract-details-still-work-to-do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to the Cowboys' official team site</a>, he's one of only three players with the Dallas owner's personal cell number.</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"I'm the one who has to sign the check and Micah's the one that has to agree to it,\" Jones said earlier this year. \"That's the straightest way to get there is the one writing the check and the one agreeing to it talking, and that's the principle that's involved here.\"</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

At 24-5 early in the second period, the result might have been anything. But by the end of the 80 minutes, the possession percentage – behind only the scoreboard in rugby’s great leaderboard of measures – actually favoured the hosts.</p><p>Fans had been warned to expect a relentless storm of red, which only grew in ferocity when those Lions chained to the substitutes’ bench were let loose. Yet the Australians finished the stronger, and almost brought the game to within a single score.</p><p>“We actually grew into the game and started to get a little bit of flow in the second half, ending up three tries apiece,” said Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt, needling the Lions camp with another measure that overstated Australia’s effectiveness.</p><p>In that spirit, it was a gallant display from many in gold, including Max Jorgensen who might be described on this night as Harry Potter-esque for the Wallabies. His magical first-half tackle on Lions’ centre Huw Jones, and help from the languid TMO, froze the opposition’s momentum like a Glacius spell. He might as well have been playing Quidditch when he stole the ball in midair from the Lions’ No 15 Hugo Keenan and raced away to score for the highlight of the match.</p><figure id=\"22273020-5261-48bf-8e2f-4d431dd9af08\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b29233b1ff37c35111e307afe4b4d901d15585/485_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b29233b1ff37c35111e307afe4b4d901d15585/485_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b29233b1ff37c35111e307afe4b4d901d15585/485_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b29233b1ff37c35111e307afe4b4d901d15585/485_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b29233b1ff37c35111e307afe4b4d901d15585/485_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b29233b1ff37c35111e307afe4b4d901d15585/485_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Australia’s Tate McDermott (left) scores a late try under pressure from the Lions’ Hugo Keenan\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b29233b1ff37c35111e307afe4b4d901d15585/485_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"355.9611608116954\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Australia’s Tate McDermott (left) scores a late try under pressure from the Lions’ Hugo Keenan to provide jittery moments for the tourists.</span> Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Then there is the “real” Harry Potter, the Wallabies’ opposite wing, with a performance like Jason Bourne. One might not always understand what he’s planning, but he always looks dangerous. Overlapping inside, tiptoeing along the touchline, kicking from midfield for the flying Jorgensen in the second half, Potter oozed main character energy. And, boy, was he up for the fight, twice ripping the ball away to prevent tries and at one stage sizing up Jack Conan, a man near twice his size.</p><p>Sure, much of the stadium may have been red, but this was occasion viewing for those fascinated by this once-every-12-years circus. A million viewers or more will have tuned into the broadcast, but many of those needed rugby reintegration after a recent lull in Australia’s third-most popular oval-ball code. After league recruit Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, the second face recognised by many fans will have been Michael Lynagh, and he hasn’t played for Australia since 1995.</p><p>Rather, it was Michael’s son Tom – reviving the determined gaze and blond flow of his father – doing his best in his run-on debut for the Wallabies at the crucial position of No 10. He has the build of a schoolboy and the facial hair to match, but when Lynagh Jr scurried and swerved, dinked and chipped his way around the field he offered a flashback via his lineage to a different era. Of running rugby and the impetuousness of amateurism. Of, yes, Wallabies World Cup victories. But when young Lynagh was obliterated in mid-air while fielding an up-and-under by the Lions’ brute Tom Curry, all were reminded it was 2025.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-11\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id=\"cbd2241d-f209-4cd3-8728-ace234eaacab\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035b16cd3e4b375d5bff6f75ee772acb77442ac2/275_0_2723_2178/master/2723.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035b16cd3e4b375d5bff6f75ee772acb77442ac2/275_0_2723_2178/master/2723.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035b16cd3e4b375d5bff6f75ee772acb77442ac2/275_0_2723_2178/master/2723.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035b16cd3e4b375d5bff6f75ee772acb77442ac2/275_0_2723_2178/master/2723.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035b16cd3e4b375d5bff6f75ee772acb77442ac2/275_0_2723_2178/master/2723.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035b16cd3e4b375d5bff6f75ee772acb77442ac2/275_0_2723_2178/master/2723.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"A young Australia fan finds cheer despite his side’s difficult outing in Brisbane\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035b16cd3e4b375d5bff6f75ee772acb77442ac2/275_0_2723_2178/master/2723.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"355.93463092177745\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>A young Australia fan finds cheer despite his side’s difficult outing in Brisbane.</span> Photograph: Tom Maher/Inpho/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>That means AI, Epstein, escalating conflict and a Lions side here to spend five weeks bullying Australia’s best. The Wallabies are clearly a work in progress. Schmidt will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/30/les-kiss-next-australia-rugby-union-wallabies-coach-profile\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">hand over the reins to Les Kiss</a> next year to build towards the real prize of the 2027 home World Cup. The dynamic means this group need only show commitment and improvement and they will earn a pass mark from the rugby faithful, as long as they keep each fixture close. “I don’t think we had anything to lose going into this game,” Lynagh Jr admitted.</p><p>So while the Lions can enjoy Saturday’s victory, and perhaps the series in as little as seven days, there are certainly more important things for Australian rugby than the result. Yes, of course, the tour’s heavily discussed revenue injection helps Rugby Australia. There is also the fleeting but welcome moment of mainstream attention the Lions, as one of world sport’s oddities, bring. But at the start of Australian rugby’s golden decade, this series also represents a reunion for the sport’s broad and sometimes distant family.</p><p>Lynagh, speaking after the match, became choked up when the topic of his London-based father was raised. “He tries not to get involved too much. I saw him for the first time in six months this morning, so it was nice to chat to him,” the 22-year-old said, his voice cracking. “I’m trying not to tear up, he was trying not to tear up this morning and just when I saw him then, so [it’s been] a very, very special moment for us in the family.”</p></div></div>"

Irving racked up 207 carries for 1,122 yards and eight touchdowns. He averaged 5.4 yards per carry and also hauled in 47 receptions for an additional 392 yards. Irving is expected to be the lead back once again in Tampa Bay, but which incoming rookies have the opportunity to make the same immediate impact for your 2025 Fantasy football lineups? </p><p>A reliable set of live-updated 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help ensure that you're getting maximum value out of every pick. They can also help you identify the potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts that could define the upcoming season. Before setting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>Last year, the model accurately predicted that Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud might take a step back in his second season. He finished as QB18 and anybody who avoided drafting him early dodged a major headache in their Fantasy football lineups. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and calling Rachaad White's breakout in 2023. Additionally, it has called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.</p><p>The model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking. The 2025 Fantasy football PPR rankings and 2024 Fantasy football standard projections update multiple times daily, so you're always getting the best Fantasy football advice.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest 2025 Fantasy football rankings, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice. A 2023 second-round pick, Rice followed up his excellent rookie season with a phenomenal start to the 2024 campaign, racking up a 24-288-2 receiving line in Weeks 1-3 before injuring his knee. Rice averaged 7.3 targets and 16.2 PPR points per game when he was on the field last season.</p><p>He unfortunately missed the remainder of the season, but appears to be fully healthy leading up to the 2025 NFL season. Kansas City's receiving corps is one of the deepest in the league, which could benefit Rice as he's expected to see a lot of one-on-one coverage. Rice is averaging one touchdown for every 11.4 catches he's made thus far in his career, so there's value to be had in selecting him on draft day. SportsLine's model ranks him as a top-20 wide receiver for 2025, making him one of the top sleepers to target for your Fantasy football lineups.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football sleepers 2025 here</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Giants wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson. The 24-year-old receiver enters his fourth NFL season, so although he's later in his career than your typical breakout, Robinson isn't much older than the incoming rookie class. Robinson played his entire rookie season at 21 years old, whereas many of the top rookie receivers are entering this season at 22. Robinson had more receptions (93) and targets (140) last year than in his first two seasons combined.</p><p>Robinson was a second-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft after having 104 receptions for 1,333 yards in 13 games as a junior at Kentucky. He was used more in New York as the season progressed, including 10 receptions in the final game of the season. With offensive head coach Brian Daboll remaining in place, that involvement could continue to rise. The model has Robinson in the range of more high-profile receivers like Rome Odunze, Chris Olave and Jayden Reed in its 2025 Fantasy football rankings as it projects Robinson to be a more reliable Fantasy football receiver this year.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football breakouts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football busts</h2><p>As for players to avoid, the model lists Chargers running back Najee Harris as one of its 2025 Fantasy football busts. Since being drafted in 2021, Harris ranks first amongst running backs in games played (68) and second in carries (1,097). While his durability may carry over from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles, don't expect his volume to. Harris was clear-cut No. 1 RB for the Steelers, ahead of Jaylen Warren, but with L.A. taking Omarion Hampton in the first round, Harris will have to adjust to a complementary role out west.</p>\n        \n\n<p>With that, it's hard to envision Harris carving out a sizable role. He's never been a proficient goal line back, as he's never had more than eight rushing scores in a season, and he offers little in the passing game as he ranked 25th amongst RBs in catches in 2024. He's also currently on the active/non-football injury list after sustaining an eye injury during a fireworks mishap. Harris finished 20th in positional Fantasy points in each of the last two seasons, but the model doesn't even have him in the top 25 RBs in its Fantasy football rankings 2025.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football busts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2>How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football football rankings</h2><p>SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising wide receiver you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy football drafts. This wide receiver is listed as a shocking top-15 option ahead of stars like A.J. Brown and Tyreek Hill.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025 Fantasy Football sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which WR shocks the NFL with a top-15 performance? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get 2025 Fantasy Football cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that called C.J.

Ionescu's 30 points tied Allie Quigley for the second most in a WNBA 3-point contest. Ionescu holds the record of 37, set in 2023.</p><p>\"I knew I wasn't going to get it when I missed a few on the front end,\" Ionescu said of the record. \"But I mean, I could have gotten close. I just missed some easy ones at the end. I think I knew I was high up there, and I kind of locked out a little bit and started like listening to the crowd. But I mean, 30 is not too bad. So I'm happy with 30 as well.\"</p><p>More than chasing her record, Ionescu was looking to avenge the last 3-point contest she participated in -- a February 2024 shootout against <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> star <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Stephen Curry</a> during NBA All-Star Weekend.</p><p>Earlier Friday, Ionescu said going up against Curry was the most pressure she had felt at an All-Star event. This time around, she was focused on having fun and not taking it too seriously. Ionescu didn't practice leading into the contest, and the first time she shot off a rack was during warmups just moments before the competition started.</p><p>\"I remember being a kid and always watching these events and finding my favorite shooter just by watching,\" Ionescu said. \"I want to be able to be that person that can show up when time permits and be a part of All-Star Weekend and kind of showcase to the world how you can believe in yourself, how you can put the work in. And whether you win or not, it takes guts to be able to go out there when the lights are the brightest.\"</p><p>Ionescu wasn't the only Liberty player to take home hardware Friday. In the opening event, teammate <a data-player-guid=\"c3d35267-fedd-d8d2-8c24-64ee7aa144ac\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2529137/natasha-cloud\">Natasha Cloud</a> won the skills challenge, setting up what the duo called a \"Liberty Biberty takeover\" of the evening.</p><p>Cloud recorded the fastest times in both rounds of the competition, clocking 34.1 seconds in the first round and 35.5 seconds in the second. She beat <a data-player-guid=\"10a2cf09-7845-e376-c86e-0fa06cbdd524\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2491214/erica-wheeler\">Erica Wheeler</a> by 1.1 seconds in the final.</p><p>Cloud won despite missing all three of her shots from the corner over a windmill -- the hardest shot of the night.</p><p>\"I was really just making sure I was making those passes through the target, that I was sprinting in between to cut down on the time from making the passes and then the shots,\" Cloud said. \"And with the shots, if it didn't feel right, I didn't care.\"</p><p>As Cloud scored her final layup, Ionescu ran down the court to bear-hug her teammate. Cloud then went to center court and picked up her girlfriend, New York teammate <a data-player-guid=\"7bce1add-eedb-11c2-3284-1351968dabf2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2566453/isabelle-harrison\">Isabelle Harrison</a>, and kissed her. Cloud said her prize money would go toward a down payment on a house for them.</p><p>\"That's Izzy B's money,\" Cloud said. \"She told me to go win this money for a home, and that's what it's going down to.\"</p><p>Cloud received $55,000 from Aflac as part of a partnership with the Women's National Basketball Players Association and an additional $2,575 from the league. Ionescu won $62,575 -- $60,000 from Aflac and $2,575 from the league.</p><p>Ionescu promised half of her winnings to <a data-player-guid=\"40260700-49ec-36b3-8b20-339722b76b02\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4433524/sonia-citron\">Sonia Citron</a>, the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"39c302ad-d5df-e0d0-33e8-1cffebc5bc75\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/wsh/washington-mystics\">Washington Mystics</a> rookie who was eliminated in the first round of the 3-point contest, and the other half to her charitable foundation, SI20.</p><p>\"I told Sonia that I would give her half if I won when we were sitting on the bench. Being the only rookie, she was nervous, and I was nervous for her,\" Ionescu said. \"Obviously have to hold up my end of the bargain. So half is going to go to her.\"</p><p>Cloud said the Liberty's sweep Friday night should set them up for a strong second half of the season after an up-and-down first half. The Liberty are just the third team to win both challenges in the same year.</p><p>\"I've been talking about it since we both entered the skills and 3-point challenge, been talking to Sab about sweeping the night,\" Cloud said. \"But today is the day, and it was a good night. I was really thankful for the opportunity ... to come out on top in the 'Liberty Biberty' night. I think it's also just refreshing. ... It's a great night for the Liberty organization.\"</p>\n</div></div>"
