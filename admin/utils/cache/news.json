Some of these bring iconic looks but others stretch the meaning of what a throwback actually is. For MLS original clubs with 30 years of history now, or ones where their brands have now changed, it makes sense to toss things back a few years but for others, that's not really the case.&nbsp;</p><p>It's similar to last season when <span>Inter</span> Miami got a throwback jersey. While it was quite <span>nice</span>, a team that played their first game in 2020 is far too new for a throwback. But with <span>Lionel Messi</span>, all things are possible, and don't worry, in this season's releases, there's an even worse offender in a team that has only played soccer in MLS for three seasons. But when jerseys are released, they must be ranked from worst to best, so let's get to it.</p><h2>10. <span>Charlotte FC</span></h2><p>There's a whole lot going on here, and most of it isn't good. The crown logo is excellent, but this whole setup is giving <span>Seattle Sounders</span> vibes. There's also the fact that Charlotte only played their first game in 2022 but are getting a throwback. There's plenty of soccer history in the city of Charlotte, but that doesn't exist with this specific club. Even going strictly on design, there's room for improvement here.</p>\n<h2>9. <span>Nashville SC</span></h2><p>See, Charlotte. Nashville have a bit more of a claim due to coming from the <span>United</span> Soccer League, but they just looked at a jersey and said, \"Groovy baby\" in their best Austin Powers voice. Nashville have good colors; they've had good alternates, and for this, they just slapped some stuff on a white shirt and called it a day.</p>\n        \n\n\n<h2>8. D.C. United</h2><p>There's not much to like about men's soccer in the District right now, and this jersey won't give you much either. It's a historic jersey, throwing it back to their inaugural season, but it is far from flashy. For those who enjoy classics, it's solid, but there are much better jerseys on the list.</p>\n<h2>7. <span>New England Revolution</span>&nbsp;</h2><p>This isn't bad, and the incorporation of the crayon flag into the entire top of the jersey is a good touch, but it feels like something is missing.</p>\n<h2>6. <span>Colorado Rapids</span></h2><p>A plain jersey is saved by an absolutely excellent logo. It'd be great if the Rapids went back to this full time, but even without that, it's good to have it back in the rotation.</p>\n        \n\n\n<h2>5. <span>Columbus Crew</span></h2><p>A bit like New <span>England</span>, it feels like something is missing from this jersey. The cadence works better due to the selection of colors, making the jersey itself look like a miner to match the logo is enough to push things up, but there's a large gap between this and the next four jerseys on the list.</p>\n<h2>4. Seattle Sounders</h2><p>Love, love, love the orca logo. The colors and trim are lovely, and the arms add a lot as well. Seattle just makes great jerseys and this is another that lives up to their reputation.</p>\n<h2>3. <span>Minnesota United</span></h2><p>It was hard not to put this at number one. The numbers, the lettering, the gradient, it's all great. Minnesota United did a great job looking back at their history to design this, and it's something that will also look great on the pitch.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n\n<h2>2. <span>San Jose Earthquakes</span> (Clash)</h2><p>The Clash was such an epic name, and it's a shame that it isn't in regular circulation anymore. But this jersey screams 70s in the best of ways. It's bold, vibrant, and either you'll love it or hate it with no in between. Nostalgia may have bumped this above Minnesota, but I make the rules here.</p>\n<h2>1. <span>FC Dallas</span> (Burn)</h2><p>Another rebrand that I wish was around on a regular basis, FC Dallas knocked this out of the park. Compared to the Clash, it's a bit safer, but that also makes this an excellent jersey that can work on or off the pitch for multiple functions. Also, it's such a sweet logo.</p>\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Chaos in the American League East</h2><p>The AL East has gone through enough plot twists this season to fill a whole series of David Baldacci novels -- and we haven't even reached August.</p><p>The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2b9cedf3-ce60-0bcf-fafe-8cd055255685\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a> looked as if they would run away with the division early, building a seven-game lead in late May, but they've gone 11-18 since June 13 and have dropped to second place, creating a panic among their fans. The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0151aed9-9f11-ceae-195d-180ca603b64a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a>, on the other hand, won 10 in a row in late June and early July to surge into first. The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f8a579c6-08b9-7584-141d-317d0645763b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a>, playing in a spring training facility, went 33-22 in May and June -- a period in which they were second in the majors in runs scored -- but have gone 3-9 in July to fall into fourth place. The Baltimore Orioles? They <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45193411/sources-orioles-fire-manager-brandon-hyde-slow-start\">fired their manager</a> and might trade half the team at the trade deadline.</p><p>But the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6df06f6-785d-3900-4935-5fd13742e2ee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a> have been the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45539218/inside-breakup-rafael-devers-boston-red-sox-trade-san-francisco-giants-mlb\">biggest melodrama of all</a>. The <a data-player-guid=\"9a29840a-6ec6-8b17-995a-f01bc7567f2d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33859/rafael-devers\">Rafael Devers</a> saga, which began in spring training, included <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/43891395/red-sox-rafael-devers-cede-3b-alex-bregman-signing\">complaints about his DH role</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/44491202/mlb-2025-season-rafael-devers-red-sox-strikeouts-history\">terrible start at the plate</a>, some hot hitting, a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45059014/rafael-devers-tells-red-sox-move-first-base\">refusal to play first base</a> and then concluded with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45520299/2025-mlb-trade-deadline-rafael-devers-san-francisco-giants-boston-red-sox-grades\">shocking trade</a> to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e072b79c-4fa1-3a55-bdcd-4d7d9734d79b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-giants\">San Francisco Giants</a>, which came hours after Boston had just completed a three-game sweep of the Yankees. A six-game losing streak soon followed as the Red Sox organization was dripping with bad karma.</p><p>But this is baseball, where the narrative can flip in a hurry: The Red Sox won their final 10 games heading into the All-Star break, have climbed into a wild-card position, are only three games out of first place and just got Bregman back from the injured list.</p><p>\"I do think there's a real chance that at the end of the season, we're looking back and we've won more games than we otherwise would've,\" chief baseball officer Craig Breslow told reporters after the Devers trade. He might be right -- at least if the pitching can deliver the way it did in that 10-game winning streak, when the staff had a 1.90 ERA.</p><p><strong>Will it remain a storyline?</strong> Absolutely. Sure, the expanded wild-card race makes division races less important than they once were, but teams still want to win the division and avoid that best-of-three wild-card round. Plus, the potential of a four-team race makes the AL East the most exciting race to follow in the second half. Though all four teams <em>could</em> still make the playoffs, that's no guarantee as the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"56d60582-088f-6848-5180-1fb04440cf87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a> currently hold one of the wild-card spots ahead of the Rays.</p><hr><h2>2. The suddenly very interesting NL Central</h2><p>The Cubs have a powerhouse lineup with MVP candidate <a data-player-guid=\"dcbeba5a-3fe9-3bf0-9f19-c077ef2a6f78\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4717833/pete-crow-armstrong\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>, fellow All-Star starter Tucker, the scorching-hot <a data-player-guid=\"52d0b18a-1810-3aa6-b963-84ecef72a66d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42415/michael-busch\">Michael Busch</a>, who is fifth in the majors in OPS, and <a data-player-guid=\"c8f56866-3f5a-304f-9961-10d6b8970628\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4142424/seiya-suzuki\">Seiya Suzuki</a>, who has 25 home runs and 77 RBIs. They have an All-Star pitcher in Boyd, <a data-player-guid=\"af1ec5d4-41a0-3097-9cb4-9e32ec6250a2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5134630/shota-imanaga\">Shota Imanaga</a> has a 2.65 ERA and the bullpen has been very good. And that's not even mentioning their catchers, who have 20 home runs, 65 RBIs and the second-highest OPS in the majors.</p><p>Despite all of that, the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4750d73d-d92e-b390-758c-2c7b44a810db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a> are only one game back.</p><p>How is that possible? They find ways to score runs without relying on the long ball; they're 23rd in the majors in home runs but seventh in runs scored, with their speed and aggressiveness on the bases helping there. As always, they somehow find enough pitching, and the anonymous-but-hard-throwing bullpen threesome of <a data-player-guid=\"f03743f7-bdcd-c6ab-b37d-f52a427827df\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40080/trevor-megill\">Trevor Megill</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"ec65e615-4e4d-31d4-b751-3cceafab0c97\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4917865/abner-uribe\">Abner Uribe</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"fcb29140-8cc7-3187-8cd3-d8f8a2ef12d1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4995802/jared-koenig\">Jared Koenig</a> has turned into one of the most imposing late-game trios.</p><p><strong>Will it remain a storyline?</strong> Yes, the Brewers are absolutely the real deal, running off seven wins in a row before the All-Star break. They do begin the second half with a tough trip against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and Mariners, with a home series against the Cubs after that to close out July, but there's a reason the Brewers have made the playoffs in six of the past seven seasons: This team knows how to win.</p><p>They've also recently added two key players in <a data-player-guid=\"b43aedac-ed9c-2317-d1b9-138512ae4818\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37515/brandon-woodruff\">Brandon Woodruff</a>, finally back from shoulder surgery, and rookie flamethrower <a data-player-guid=\"0ea828df-ab12-3e43-8900-dee0563e68d4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080761/jacob-misiorowski\">Jacob Misiorowski</a>, who is 4-1 with a 2.65 ERA in five starts, dominating with his fastball that averages 99.3 mph. Indeed, Misiorowski looms as one of the most important players the rest of the way: If he keeps this going and with Woodruff looking like his pre-injury form -- 18 strikeouts and no walks in his two starts -- the trio of <a data-player-guid=\"aa1cac72-2915-387f-9e32-4b2f84f52b1d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39825/freddy-peralta\">Freddy Peralta</a>, Woodruff and Misiorowski will be a scary rotation to face in October.</p><hr><h2>3. The epic <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45717038/2025-mlb-awards-watch-all-star-break-mvp-cy-young-judge-ohtani-skubal-wheeler-skenes\">American League MVP race</a></h2><p>We all know the details of this one:</p><ul><li><p>Behind curtain No. 1: <a data-player-guid=\"6c27dcb5-a741-d526-b5ac-f3988e288a70\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41292/cal-raleigh\">Cal Raleigh</a>, on pace for an AL-record 64 home runs (he currently has 38) and putting together perhaps the greatest offensive season ever for a catcher.</p></li><li><p>Behind curtain No. 2: <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a>, on pace for 11.8 WAR and putting together one of the greatest offensive seasons in the sport's history.</p></li></ul><p>It's hard to believe a catcher might hit 50-something home runs -- or more -- and <em>not</em> win the MVP award, but that's what might happen. Voters are WAR-focused these days, and Judge has a chance for only the sixth 12-WAR season by a position player (three of the previous five are by Babe Ruth). That probably makes Judge the favorite, especially since he's not far behind Raleigh with 35 home runs and is probably one of his patented hot streaks away from getting back on pace for another 60-homer season.</p><p><strong>Will it remain a storyline? </strong>Let's hope so. Remember, we were in a similar situation a year ago with an epic three-player race between Judge, <a data-player-guid=\"953a1c30-3f92-3387-bc26-c4ad94124e87\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42403/bobby-witt-jr\">Bobby Witt Jr</a>. and <a data-player-guid=\"ec24d6f9-f841-3686-b7b4-a5b8ace0294c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42507/gunnar-henderson\">Gunnar Henderson</a>, only to see Judge pull away to an eventual unanimous selection over Witt. It's hard to imagine Raleigh keeping it going at this rate, especially given his heavy workload behind the plate (he's third in the majors in innings caught), and he has been a little one dimensional in July (he has only five hits, all of them home runs). Judge is the heavy betting favorite at -600 to +325 for Raleigh, according to <a href=\"https://espnbet.com/sport/baseball/organization/united-states/competition/mlb/section/player-awards\">ESPN BET</a>.</p><hr><h2>4. Pete Crow-Armstrong leads the National League MVP race</h2><p>As a rookie in 2024, Crow-Armstrong hit .237/.286/.384 with 10 home runs in 123 games -- not exactly numbers that would have projected him as an MVP candidate the following year. But he has emerged as not only one of the most exciting players in the majors, but one of the most valuable as well. With 25 home runs and 27 stolen bases, he's on pace for a 40/40 season, and with help from some superlative defensive metrics, he leads the NL in both Baseball-Reference WAR (5.2) and FanGraphs WAR. (4.9), beating <a data-player-guid=\"05e514e4-4e08-31e8-a7bc-7aa82497d299\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4918256/james-wood\">James Wood</a> (4.4) in the former and <a data-player-guid=\"04a76996-4a5c-456d-8022-a9d45e3ff933\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> (4.3) in the latter.</p><p>Crow-Armstrong would certainly be one of the most surprising MVP winners ever, and one of the most distinctive. His .302 OBP would be the lowest for an MVP position player, beating Zoilo Versalles' .319 mark from 1965. Only 10 MVP winners have had an OBP below .350. He'd also be the first center fielder to win NL MVP since <a data-player-guid=\"30bf5002-eecd-6c70-8e35-118a58a3f878\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/28701/andrew-mccutchen\">Andrew McCutchen</a> in 2013.</p><p><strong>Will it remain a storyline?</strong> Yes. With Crow-Armstrong's ultra-aggressive approach at the plate (he has the highest chase rate in the majors among qualified batters), it figured pitchers would eventually figure out how to exploit that. But they haven't so far and PCA, while not possessing huge raw power, continues to barrel up baseballs. Looming in his rearview mirror in the MVP race: Ohtani, who has now added pitching to his repertoire and is slowly working up to a starter's workload. He leads the NL in home runs, slugging, runs scored, OPS and total bases. ESPN BET has made him the favorite at -700, with Crow-Armstrong at +750.

A 2-7 slump heading into the break highlighted some of their issues: Betts has a sub-.700 OPS, <a data-player-guid=\"56c5b82d-6d6a-fcbb-234f-1822a821f15e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30193/freddie-freeman\">Freddie Freeman</a> is hitting .197 with one home run over his past 32 games, Scott has seven blown saves, the rotation ranks just 20th in the majors in ERA (and last in innings pitched) and the bullpen ranks 24th in ERA. Oh, and the Dodgers have churned through 35 pitchers this season.</p><p><strong>Will it remain a storyline?</strong> Check back in October, when the Dodgers will try to become the first team since the 2000 Yankees to repeat as World Series champs.</p><hr><h2>6.

But their final series before the break exposed a potential weakness. The Mariners swept the three-game series in Detroit, scoring 35 runs -- 23 of which came against the bullpen. <a data-player-guid=\"17942761-e268-183a-a0bd-398409978d58\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31867/tommy-kahnle\">Tommy Kahnle</a>, part of the late-game duo with <a data-player-guid=\"15b2b6e3-7e1e-33f5-1a46-f04bae63a19b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41606/will-vest\">Will Vest</a>, gave up four runs Saturday and three Sunday. Vest blew a 4-3 lead in the eighth Sunday, before Kahnle gave up back-to-back homers in the ninth. The Tigers will no doubt be looking for some relief help at the trade deadline.</p><hr><h2>7. Tarik Skubal, <a data-player-guid=\"cdfd69c1-1b9b-30fe-acf4-aad457b0850e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719507/paul-skenes\">Paul Skenes</a> and an incredible season for pitchers<!--?h2--></h2><p>Skubal and Skenes started the All-Star Game -- and that pair has been leading the way in what has been a stellar season for starting pitchers. At the break, we had 19 qualified pitchers with an ERA under 3.00, which would match 2022 as the most since 2014 (when there were 21). There are another five pitchers, who aren't currently qualified, with at least 80 innings and an ERA under 3.00, so the total could climb by the end of the season. Four of those pitchers also had an imposing strikeout rate above 30%: Skubal (33.4%), <a data-player-guid=\"150fa88b-caca-cd7c-3ea9-353c2a361244\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31267/zack-wheeler\">Zack Wheeler</a> (33.0%), <a data-player-guid=\"758d4fc6-a046-3dc0-9280-c6279357128c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4297835/garrett-crochet\">Garrett Crochet</a> (31.2%) and <a data-player-guid=\"cc9ee364-ac21-3540-ab45-3fee5fe359d1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4717803/hunter-brown\">Hunter Brown</a> (31.1%). <a data-player-guid=\"5f496806-d3fa-4226-e557-dc945eda4f3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39636/mackenzie-gore\">MacKenzie Gore</a>, with a 3.02 ERA, is also above the 30% mark.</p><p>Skenes has been the bad-luck pitcher of the season, maybe of the century: He is 4-8 despite an MLB-best 2.01 ERA, but he might still be the Cy Young favorite. He could become the first Cy Young winner with a losing record (Jacob deGrom went 10-9 with the Mets in 2018 and Felix Hernandez went 13-12 with the Mariners in 2010).</p><p><strong>Will it remain a storyline?</strong> Sure. With so many pitchers having great seasons, Skubal and Skenes hardly have the Cy Young Awards wrapped up, with Crochet and Wheeler essentially in a statistical deadlock with them. Brown was in the AL mix before giving up 10 runs in his final two starts before the break. Keep an eye on DeGrom, who is 9-2 with a 2.32 ERA and has already pitched his most innings since 2019.</p><hr><h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a>'s topsy-turvy tenure with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a></h2><p>In his first month with the Mets, Soto hit .241/.368/.384 with only three home runs. Then he hit .219 in May. But the Mets were winning, and the statistical evidence showed that Soto was hitting the ball hard and taking his walks -- meaning, it was really the same old Soto, except the hits just weren't falling. Since June 1, he has hit .311/.455/.659 with 14 home runs and now ranks among the league leaders in many categories. Despite the slow start, he's on pace for 6.5 WAR, which isn't quite what he did with the Yankees last season (7.9) but is right in line with his career average per 162 games (6.3). In other words, he's the same Juan Soto, except his best hitting has come as the Mets have scuffled after their hot start.</p><p><strong>Will it remain a storyline?</strong> With the Mets battling for the NL East title with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, you bet. One thing to watch: While the overall offensive numbers are creeping back into typical Soto territory, he has hit only .183/.330/.390 with runners in scoring position and .176/.337/.340 with men on base. According to Baseball-Reference, he has a .783 OPS in high-leverage situations, .773 in medium leverage and 1.053 in low leverage. The Mets are paying Soto a lot of money to produce in those high-leverage moments, so if they are to beat out the Phillies, he will need to pick it up in those situations.</p><hr><h2>9. Young sluggers burst onto the scene</h2><p>We saw <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4918256\">James Wood</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"64b000df-915b-374c-81eb-e1b79b1e81f2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4905921/junior-caminero\">Junior Caminero</a> in the Home Run Derby, and both are having outstanding first full seasons in the majors. Wood has 24 home runs and ranks eighth in the majors in OPS. Caminero has 23 home runs, but not the overall offensive numbers that Wood has. A year ago, <a data-player-guid=\"3c91bc94-f039-3293-8b62-e6371ebaea0b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4966637/nick-kurtz\">Nick Kurtz</a> had just been drafted in the first round by the Athletics out of Wake Forest and now he has mashed 17 home runs in 58 games after beginning the season in Triple-A. Over his past 26 games, he has hit .295/.385/.737 with 12 home runs and looks as if he's developing into one of the best power hitters in the game.</p><p>Still looking to get on track is <a data-player-guid=\"3fc95bff-3509-37f1-ae44-45eaeb035f6a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4926296/jac-caglianone\">Jac Caglianone</a>, also in his first year out of college. He reached the majors with more hype than Kurtz but has struggled with a .140 average and four home runs through 35 games, although he flashed his light-tower power with one blast of 466 feet. These players are all 22 years old. The game is in good hands.</p><p><strong>Will it remain a storyline?</strong> Yes and no. Caminero's Rays are the only team in the playoff hunt right now, though Caglianone's <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"11a5df00-0945-35a5-66fe-a3a107975558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-royals\">Kansas City Royals</a> are close enough to potentially get back into the wild-card chase. Wood's season has sort of flown under the radar playing for the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals\">Washington Nationals</a>, but he has an OPS+ of 160. In the wild-card era since 1995, only five players in their age-22 season have reached that mark: <a data-player-guid=\"e1be67bf-3688-8bd6-9bd6-c01d0e34e119\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30836/mike-trout\">Mike Trout</a> (2014), <a data-player-guid=\"a3630ca2-c9aa-7ff0-2a19-2d714c80b459\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30951/bryce-harper\">Bryce Harper</a> (2015), and Juan Soto, <a data-player-guid=\"011563f3-5637-9d59-9629-2e6ff3c32b20\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35002/vladimir-guerrero-jr\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr</a>. and <a data-player-guid=\"e2da449e-fe21-39e0-bd60-5b548dc4108b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35983/fernando-tatis-jr\">Fernando Tatis Jr</a>. all in 2021. That's not bad company to be part of.</p><hr><h2>10. How many games will the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f3f1ba71-05f1-a49a-0363-3b1d8e0db4cf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/col/colorado-rockies\">Colorado Rockies</a> lose?</h2><p>After a 9-50 start left them on pace to lose 137 games, it looked as if the Rockies might shatter the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8f4800c6-3c05-b3d5-8186-9750cd72a3c2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox\">Chicago White Sox</a>'s modern record of 121 losses from last season. The Rockies won three in a row at that point and had another four-game winning streak later in June, but then went 4-14 in their final 18 games before the break. That left them with a 22-74 record, still on pace to finish 37-125. They <em>have</em> played a little better: They had a minus-77 run differential in March/April and minus-106 in May but were minus-38 in June. They're back to minus-32  in July, with losses of 10-2, 10-2, 10-3 and 9-3 this month. It's impossible to know which direction this will go the rest of the way.</p><p><strong>Will it remain a storyline?</strong> It appears so. It might come down to the wire, and the Rockies finish the season with trips to Seattle and San Francisco.</p>\n</div></div>"

At Bramall Lane it was England's day, a match immortalised by <a data-player-guid=\"4d853184-f7e7-36a9-a3bd-a56637c20fb8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/263683/alessia-russo\">Alessia Russo</a>'s backheel goal, and a performance which teed up their finest day, victory against <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"3002cdb6-4d2f-4a63-fb74-f789fa9067fb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2756\">Germany</a> in the final at Wembley. But any talk of that match having any swing on Thursday's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.weuro\" target=\"_blank\">Euro 2025</a> quarterfinal in Zurich has been shut down.</p><p><a data-player-guid=\"c8b219ba-ee36-879a-fa3b-782442a3b2f8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/268100/leah-williamson\">Leah Williamson</a>, England's captain three years ago, will lead them once again. It was standing-room only at England's spectacular base at the opulent Dolder Grand hotel just outside the hubbub of Zurich when she spoke to the media on Tuesday. She reflected on triumphs past, hope of glory in the future but also the size of the task facing England right now.</p><p>The teams have played each other twice since, both matches ending in draws with Sweden the unluckier. So England are under no illusions about the size of task. A group of the Lionesses, including Williamson, watched Sweden's 4-1 dismantling of Germany on Saturday and they came away impressed. \"I do think Sweden deserve a little bit more recognition,\" Williamson said.</p><p>In the Sweden camp, they have been training in far more ordinary surroundings, away from the UEFA recommended list. They're at a fitness centre in Cham, a town 30 kilometres north of Zurich, called \"On Your Mark.\" The rooms are minimalist, and the facilities not as extravagant. But Sweden prioritised ease: the players walk from their facilities onto the training pitch, where <a data-player-guid=\"90bc2c10-6dc6-50a6-8ba6-d1279ab6a1ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/255181/nathalie-bjorn\">Nathalie Björn</a> will have a playlist ready for them. They still have the customary pool table, golf simulator and other distractions -- but the ice rink is off-limits.</p><p>That's not to say the whole setup hasn't had its teething problems, like assistant coach Magnus Wilkman having a room next to building work. \"I have a construction site in the living room, an angle grinder in the kitchen and a crane that is controlled from the headboard,\" he said. \"They start working at a quarter past five every morning. If you open the blinds, you can shake hands with the guy in the crane.\"</p><p>England will be well aware how hard this game will be. Sweden took the bronze medal in the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/league/_/name/fifa.wwc\" target=\"_blank\">Women's World Cup</a> (including knocking out the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"cb9be884-d621-f46a-952e-7f9ef155cad5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2765\">United States</a> on penalties in the round of 16) and they are on a 16-match unbeaten run. At Euro 2025, Sweden are three wins from three, sealed by that dominant victory over Germany which secured top spot in the group and a date at the Stadion Letzigrund.</p><p>Peter Gerhardsson is still the head coach, thought this fourth major tournament in charge of the <em>Blågult </em>will be his last. But this is a very different Sweden side.</p><p>Sweden have four players under the age of 25, compared to two in 2023.

She's a great player and she has been for many years now. Her experience speaks for itself.\"</p><p>The defence is anchored by Björn and Eriksson, who missed their first two matches, with <a data-player-guid=\"972f947a-a66e-7bde-c47b-1c66be26d5e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/255177/jennifer-falk\">Jennifer Falk</a> in goal (<a data-player-guid=\"cf2074a4-d945-1ec6-cda8-b0f9ce491ed5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/255417/zecira-musovic\">Zecira Musovic</a> was first choice but announced in February she is pregnant.)</p><p>England know the threats and they are anticipating plenty of battles in the air. \"Definitely, it's one of their main threats,\" Williamson said. \"And they are good at it and it's something that we've had a look at.

They're just a very organized team. They work hard, we know their characteristics, so it'll be tough.</p><p>\"They work so well together. [They] don't necessarily have to have a crazy standout threat here or there because everybody plays their role. They are hard to prepare for in that sense. Their discipline of wanting to complete the job on the pitch makes them a dangerous side.\"</p><p>In the Sweden camp, there's also a drop of surprise at how they haven't seen their name mentioned in the same breath as other perceived favourites. \"I think you can never count out Sweden in a championship, we have had good results before and everyone knows that,\" Rytting Kaneryd said. \"A championship is special in many ways and we are strong there.</p><p>\"But it's clear, look at <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b40064c7-ecaa-338f-74a8-a3eb43071ec3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=17640\">Spain</a>, they have had absolutely fantastic matches and scored some goals. Now that we've scored four goals against Germany, maybe we will be more dangerous. It doesn't feel like people talk about Sweden that way and I don't know why. We've always been a bit of an underdog. I definitely think teams are starting to notice us and feel like they might not want to face us.\"</p><p>Asllani has hinted this may be her final tournament. Others may follow suit, but this is no \"Last Dance\" for them. Playing for Sweden is addictive for so many, which explains their several centurions.</p><p>And the Swedish fans are enthralled by this run, with the team's allocation of tickets sold out in an hour. Gerhardsson said the support has at times taken his breath away, while the players feed off it. \"We never thought it would be as big as it is,\" Rytting Kaneryd said. \"It's a really good sign that we have the support from Sweden.\"</p><p>There'll be a wall of yellow awaiting England, and the Lionesses will feel the claustrophobia of the <em>Blågult</em>'s support. Amid all the subplots, there's a quarterfinal to win.</p><p>When a manager announces pre-tournament it's to be their final competition, it's rare they'll know in advance when their last match will be. We've already seen two managers bow out in <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"614c2892-68ef-2595-b8ba-1e47a3afd030\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2896\">Denmark</a>'s Andrée Jeglertz and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0a0c383a-529d-d9ee-1a31-cf53c70954ce\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=7151\">Netherlands</a>' Andries Jonker after subpar performances. But Gerhardsson has kept the ship afloat and headed in the right direction. When he does step away, he will remember games like the one in Sheffield, but he hopes the best memory is yet to come.</p><p>\"It didn't go well for us [at Euro 2022] because they scored four goals, but that is history,\" he said. \"Now it is a new game if we are going to meet England. We are going to write a new history, a better history, a good history.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

We try to answer some of the biggest questions heading into the 153rd Open.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Is Scottie Scheffler still the overwhelming favorite this week?</h2><p><strong>Mark Schlabach: </strong>The Open is the only major championship in which Scheffler hasn't finished in the top three, but links golf hasn't exactly befuddled him. He has four top-25s in as many starts in the event, including a tie for seventh at Royal Troon Golf Club in Scotland last year.</p><p>Links golf would seem to fit the three-time major champion's game perfectly. His world-class iron play shouldn't leave him in too many difficult spots, and on the rare occasion when he does miss the green, his exceptional short game should be able to bail him out. His putting, which was once considered a weakness, has improved dramatically; he ranks 22nd on tour in strokes gained putting (.362) this season.</p><p>McIlroy, <a data-player-guid=\"f7192f24-1537-e91b-de6f-3548d5989626\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9780/jon-rahm\">Jon Rahm</a> and others are more than capable of lifting the Claret Jug on Sunday, but how can you go against Scheffler at this point? He hasn't finished outside the top 25 in each of his 15 starts on the PGA Tour this season, and he was in the top 10 in each of his past 10.</p><p><strong>Paolo Uggetti:</strong> Yes, but with a caveat. While Scheffler hasn't exactly performed poorly at this major, as Mark pointed out, there is some tension between Scheffler's propensity for fairness on a golf course and the essence of links golf, which can often straddle the line between fair and unfair.</p><p>It appears, however, that Scheffler is trying to embrace that a bit more. It helps, too, that he considers Portrush on the fairer side of links tracks, especially its pot bunkers.</p><p>\"I think some of the links courses I've played, it was kind of hit or miss when you went into a bunker what kind of lie you were going to get,\" Scheffler said. \"There's a lot more slope into the bunkers where the ball kind of funnels into the middle. I would argue that might be a little bit more fair than two guys hitting a similar shot and one guy has to putt it back into the bunker and the other guy has a clean lie.\"</p><p>Yet, as always with Scheffler, it may just come down to his putting. Though he has improved in that area, he is coming off a week at the Scottish Open where he lost nearly a stroke and a half to the field on the greens. That doesn't exactly inspire confidence in his ability to handle another week of links surfaces.</p><p>\"I think getting adjusted to speed is always kind of the most important over here,\" Scheffler said. \"Outside of that, putting is putting. Golf is still golf no matter where you're playing.\"</p><hr><h2>What do you expect from Rory McIlroy this week?</h2><p><strong>Schlabach:</strong> I'd be stunned if it doesn't go much better than the last time we saw McIlroy competing in an Open at Royal Portrush. In the first Open Championship in Northern Ireland in 68 years in 2019, McIlroy seemed overwhelmed by the expectations of being the crowd favorite in his homeland.</p><p>On the first tee, McIlroy pulled his drive left into internal out of bounds, leading to a quadruple-bogey 8. He carded a double-bogey 5 on the 16th and triple-bogey 7 on the 18th, adding up to an 8-over 79 in the first round.</p><p>To McIlroy's credit, he rebounded to make seven birdies and one bogey in the second round, nearly rallying to make the cut with a 6-under 65.</p><p>\"You get to an Open, it's a major championship, everything that comes along with it, and I just think that feeling, the walk to the first tee and then that ovation, I was still a little surprised and a little taken aback, like, 'Geez, these people really want me to win,'\" McIlroy said this week.</p><p>\"I think that brought its own sort of pressure and more internally from myself and not really wanting to let people down. I guess it's just something I didn't mentally prepare for that day or that week. But I learned pretty quickly that one of my challenges, especially in a week like this, is controlling myself and controlling that battle.\"</p><p>McIlroy and Ireland's <a data-player-guid=\"81036860-da90-8d9e-be1e-38fdfff557fc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/4587/shane-lowry\">Shane Lowry</a>, who captured the Claret Jug in 2019, figure to have the biggest galleries following them again.</p><p>McIlroy's game seems to be in a better place after his post-Masters victory lull; he tied for sixth at the Travelers Championship and for second at the Genesis Scottish Open.</p><p>He certainly has some fond memories of Royal Portrush as well: He set the course record with a 61 as a 16-year-old.</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>For all the talk about how McIlroy might be freed up after his Masters win and what has happened instead, it's ironic and fitting that the place where he has looked perhaps most comfortable and in his element has been here -- in Scotland last week and Northern Ireland this week.</p><p>McIlroy talked Monday about embracing the homecoming he knows he is going to get from local fans instead of isolating himself like he did in 2019. You can already tell he's doing that as he takes time to sign for fans and give them nods and acknowledgments throughout his practice rounds.</p><p>Of course, none of that matters if his game isn't up to par. The good news for McIlroy is that it appears it is. At the Scottish, McIlroy's game looked sharper than it has since the Masters and he seemed content with where things stand heading into the last major of the year.</p><p>\"I'm excited with where my game is. I felt like I showed some really good signs last week,\" McIlroy, who finished second, said. \"I feel like I'm in a good spot and had -- not that last week was a pure preparation week, but I definitely feel like it put me in a good spot heading into here.\"</p><p>At this point, I would be more surprised if McIlroy isn't in the mix come the weekend than if he is.</p><hr><h2>Thoughts on Xander Schauffele's defense?</h2><p><strong>Schlabach: </strong>It's the last major championship of the year and the final shot at glory, and the reigning Champion Golfer of the Year could use something positive to salvage what has so far been a lost season.</p><p>It's not as if Schauffele has played poorly this season; he hasn't missed a cut in 12 starts on tour and has seven top-25s. His campaign simply feels incomplete after he missed eight weeks with a painful rib injury. His best finishes were a tie for eighth at the Masters and last week's Scottish Open.</p><p>It isn't hard to figure out why Schauffele hasn't won in 2025 after capturing his first two majors at the PGA Championship and The Open last season. He ranks 112th on tour in strokes gained off the tee (-.018) and 138th in putting (-.144).</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>The more I hear Schauffele talk, the more I think he will win multiple Open Championships, whether it's this week or beyond.</p><p>It seems like he has the ideal approach and attitude toward links golf in that he knows it will be difficult, he knows it will be unpredictable and yet he is relishing the opportunity to grind through anything the course and the conditions throw at him.</p><p>\"It's just the mentality. I think, when you say links golf, it comes with weather, and when you play in bad weather, you have to have a good attitude,\" Schauffele said. \"You have to visualize a lot more than just hitting your number on a machine.\"</p><p>Schauffele hasn't had what I imagine is the follow-up he expected to a dream season last year, but he is clearly trending in the right direction after a T-12 in the U.S. Open and a T-8 at the Scottish last week. If the conditions get unruly this weekend, there aren't many guys you would trust to excel. Schauffele is one of those.</p><hr><h2>What to know about Royal Portrush and how you expect it to play this week</h2><p><strong>Schlabach: </strong>It's all going to depend on the weather and wind because Royal Portrush is exposed to all of the elements on the northern tip of Northern Ireland.</p><p>That being said, Lowry and the rest of the field enjoyed unbelievable scoring conditions in the first three rounds in 2019. The rain stayed away and the winds were calm, as Lowry carded a bogey-free 63 on Saturday to set a 54-hole scoring record in The Open.</p><p>Then on Sunday, torrential rains and steady winds blew as Lowry and others held on.</p><p>\"We'll see how the weather turns out this week,\" Scheffler said. \"Weather has a pretty dramatic effect on how the golf course is going to play. You can play your practice rounds and prepare, but ultimately when you step on the tee on Thursday, whatever the weather presents is going to be probably the strongest part of the test.\"</p><p>Schauffele noted that the wind can even affect golfers' putts.</p><p>\"Putting is always tricky with wind,\" Schauffele said. \"There's some holes where the mounds cover the greens and some holes that are more exposed where the wind is going to affect the ball on the green. I think whoever wins this week is an extremely well-rounded player.\"</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>It can be gettable (see Lowry's 63 in 2019) and it can also feel impossible depending on the strength of the wind and the direction. Above all, it will require a great amount of strategic decision-making.</p><p>Case in point: During his Monday practice round, I watched McIlroy hit a driver into a 400-yard par 4 and then 3-iron into a 474-yard par 4. I watched him debate with his caddie Harry Diamond for a few minutes about what club to hit off the tricky 15th hole if it played downwind.</p><p>As Scheffler and others have pointed out, Portrush is a links course but it is unique in that there are more elevation changes than at most links courses. This makes for an interesting combination of ground game and air game.</p><p>The players who can figure out when it is right to use one or the other will likely be the ones fighting for the Claret Jug come Sunday.</p><hr><h2>One longer shot that could be in contention this week?</h2><p><strong>Schlabach: </strong>It wasn't long ago that 2022 U.S. Open champion <a data-player-guid=\"a11204a7-ef27-3f00-a28e-358ee5984e77\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/9037/matt-fitzpatrick\">Matt Fitzpatrick</a> described his game as \"rubbish,\" and it had been a while since the English golfer had been in the mix at one of the big four until he tied for eighth at the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club in May.</p><p>The 30-year-old doesn't have a great track record in The Open, but he's coming in with good form after tying for eighth at the Rocket Classic and for fourth in the Scottish Open. If the weather gets tricky on the weekend, Fitzpatrick is more than capable of handling the conditions, just like he did at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, when he captured his first major.</p><p><strong>Uggetti: </strong>How about <a data-player-guid=\"25cd1b68-2fd7-49bb-68e9-6abe8d8896ba\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/569/justin-rose\">Justin Rose</a>? Not only did he take McIlroy to a playoff at the Masters, but just last year at Royal Troon, Rose had a real shot to win on the back nine and came up short of Schauffele by only two shots.</p><p>Rose is also coming off an impressive finish at the Scottish Open, where he shot 7 under in the final round to jump all the way up to sixth place. If Rose is able to conjure up one more run at a major this week and end a 33-year drought for Englishmen in the Open it would be an epic story.</p>\n</div></div>"

Every opportunity Miami had was thwarted by Cincinnati's strong back line.</p><p>Messi had two shot attempts late in the first half.

It clearly worries me because, in the end, the team has been suffering from a lot of muscle injuries all season,\" Mascherano said. \"The intensity of the games we've played, especially in the last month and a half, has been very, very high. But, well, we also clearly have to find some explanation, improve, and try to avoid it because obviously the team is gradually deteriorating with injuries.\"</p><p><em>ESPN's Lizzy Becherano contributed to this report, and information from Reuters was also used.</em></p>\n</div></div>"

It came in just the last couple holes,\" Mickelson said. \"I really enjoy playing these conditions and playing this tournament. It's just a lot of fun.\"</p><p>The six-time major winner was on top of the leaderboard early in the day after playing his first nine holes in 2 under. Mickelson stumbled into two bogeys on the back nine but was able to make a 20-footer on No. 17 to add another birdie to his card.</p><p>None of the birdies, however, were as impressive as the par he made on the par-3 third. Mickelson's tee shot found the tricky greenside bunker, and when he couldn't get out on his first attempt, he had to tap into some magic. His third shot landed right of the flag and spun into the hole for par.</p><p>\"That was a crazy one,\" Mickelson said. \"To make it, it was obviously a lot of luck. It was crazy. I was just trying to save bogey, and I got lucky and it went in.\"</p><p>Luck seems to be a much bigger part of the equation at a tournament like The Open, where weather conditions and links golf dole out unpredictable bounces and lies left and right. Mickelson, who won the 2013 Open at Muirfield in Scotland, said he was proud of how he has been able to embrace that style of golf over the course of his career.</p><p>\"I think winning The Open in 2013 was the greatest accomplishment in my career because I had to learn a style of golf that I didn't grow up playing,\" Mickelson said. \"Now I've come to really love it, enjoy it, and I seem to play well in some of the adverse conditions.\"</p><p>Mickelson and his playing partners were able to dodge the worst of the weather Thursday, but it is likely to find them at some point Friday or beyond.</p><p>\"When you get conditions like this, you start to fall back on realizing that 60, 80 feet in the proper spot is like a good spot, and you start to realize that you can make 20- or 30-footers out here,\" Mickelson said. \"You find that going back on past experience, you don't have to press it. You don't have to force it.\"</p><p>During his first round, Mickelson hit over 50% of his greens and allowed his short game and putting to help him gain over three strokes on the field in that area.</p><p>Heading into Friday, he is well positioned to make the cut. Last year at Royal Troon, Mickelson finished tied for 60th, but it was his first made cut at this event since 2016. This year, he has missed the cut at the other three majors.</p><p>\"I just think it's a sign of a complete player, to be able to win in all the conditions of the majors that they provide,\" Mickelson said. \"Obviously I've never won a U.S. Open, but winning a Masters requires a whole different style of play than winning a U.S. Open and a PGA. This is unique as well.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

Raleigh drew fairly close in late June, but the gap has since widened again. That's not Raleigh's fault; it's just Judge being Judge. At the time of our last Awards Watch, Judge had a 1.234 OPS. Since then, he has managed a meager 1.141. Yeah, that's still pretty good.</p><p>The shape of Judge's numbers has changed a bit. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45253929/2025-mlb-awards-watch-memorial-day-mvp-cy-young-judge-ohtani\">When we convened in late May</a>, he was hitting .395, and he has posted a mortal .297 average since. But he has picked things up in the slugging category. Last time, he was mashing homers at the rate of 54 per 162 games. Since, that number is 66. Raleigh might be having the greatest catcher season of all time, and it's possible that if there is any kind of Judge fatigue among the voters, that could impact the ballot. But what isn't likely is any kind of prolonged drop-off by Judge.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> Buxton wasn't in the top 10 last time out, but he has entered the top five based on several weeks of elite production and good health. During an 11-year career marked as much by injury as spectacular play, the first half featured Buxton at his best and most available, putting him on pace for his first 30/30 season at age 31. It keeps getting better: Since the last Awards Watch, Buxton has a 1.025 OPS with rates of 48 homers and 39 steals per 162 games.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Last time, there were two Red Sox in the top 10. Both have dropped out, with <a data-player-guid=\"b28542aa-30be-6851-75c4-501226976e1c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34886/alex-bregman\">Alex Bregman</a> hitting the IL and <a data-player-guid=\"9a29840a-6ec6-8b17-995a-f01bc7567f2d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33859/rafael-devers\">Rafael Devers</a> hitting the airport for a flight to join his new team in San Francisco. But Boston is still represented by the overlooked Rafaela. No, he isn't going to overtake Judge in the MVP race, but one of baseball's most unique players deserves a little run.</p><p>After splitting time between shortstop and center field in 2024, Rafaela has played almost exclusively on the grass this season, and his defensive metrics have been off the charts. That's driving this ranking, but Rafaela also has made tremendous strides at the plate. After entering the season with a career OPS+ of 83, he has upped that number to 118 in 2025 and is on pace for a 20/20 campaign.</p><hr><p><strong>National League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"04a76996-4a5c-456d-8022-a9d45e3ff933\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> (144 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2. <a data-player-guid=\"dcbeba5a-3fe9-3bf0-9f19-c077ef2a6f78\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4717833/pete-crow-armstrong\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a> (143); 3. <a data-player-guid=\"e2da449e-fe21-39e0-bd60-5b548dc4108b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35983/fernando-tatis-jr\">Fernando Tatis Jr.</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a> (136); 4. <a data-player-guid=\"b963b85d-6db2-f0e5-b763-88d4a41c0d73\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34967/kyle-tucker\">Kyle Tucker</a>, Cubs (135); 5. <a data-player-guid=\"05e514e4-4e08-31e8-a7bc-7aa82497d299\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4918256/james-wood\">James Wood</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals\">Washington Nationals</a> (134); 6. <a data-player-guid=\"7e560f9f-b486-f5f1-20a4-7699c1338287\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/38309/will-smith\">Will Smith</a>, Dodgers (131); 7.

He has lurked behind Ohtani on the AXE leaderboard for most of the season, but a quiet series from Ohtani in Milwaukee paired with another outburst from Crow-Armstrong flipped the top spot. Ohtani is still the favorite -- the leaderboard flipped again over the weekend and, besides, he's Ohtani -- but at this point, we have to come to grips with the reality that Crow-Armstrong can mount a legitimate challenge.</p><p>Like Rafaela, Crow-Armstrong's defensive metrics are top of the charts and, in fact, those two are in a duel for the MLB lead in defensive runs saved metrics among outfielders. But Crow-Armstrong's bat continues to fuel his rise to superstar status. He entered the break on pace for 42 homers and 46 steals.</p><p>Ironically, if the offensive numbers between Ohtani and Crow-Armstrong are tight, it could come down to very different forms of run prevention. Crow-Armstrong is at 15 defensive runs saved as a center fielder. Meanwhile, Ohtani is at three runs above average during his nine innings on the mound. As the pitching side of Ohtani's record grows, that gap might narrow considerably.</p><p>If that happens and it comes down to a straight-up comparison at the plate, it's going to be tough for Crow-Armstrong, whose 140 OPS+ currently is dwarfed by Ohtani's 174.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> Wood continues to cement his arrival as a right-now star player, and his pace has been accelerating even after an excellent start. Despite a subdued week before the break, Wood has a .908 OPS and 162-game rates of 42 homers, 127 RBIs, 19 steals and 100 runs since the last Awards Watch. Overall, he has a .381 OBP and is on pace for 100 walks, so those numbers aren't driven by a short-term power surge. At 22, Wood simply is already an all-around offensive force.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Tucker overtook Crow-Armstrong for the No. 2 slot (and the Cubs' team lead) in AXE late in June, before Crow-Armstrong reasserted himself. But Tucker's production is metronomic: His AXE at the last Awards Watch was 130, and he is now at 135. Tucker has an .839 OPS at Wrigley Field as compared to .905 on the road, where 12 of his 17 homers have been hit. But if warmer weather and outward-blowing winds become consistent in Chicago, a Tucker power surge could be in the offing.

A few more weeks have brought AXE in line with reality, as Skubal has gone to that magical place few pitchers ever reach.</p><p>Skubal's blastoff actually began when we posted the last Awards Watch, as he was coming off a complete-game, two-hit shutout against Cleveland. Perhaps the most impressive part of that outing is that he recorded 13 strikeouts on just 94 pitches. Well, since then, Skubal did the same thing to Minnesota: 13 whiffs on 93 pitches on June 29.</p><p>In eight outings following the last Watch, Skubal has gone 5-1 with a 1.89 ERA, thrown at least seven innings five times and posted an absurd ratio of 61 strikeouts to nine walks. This race isn't over, but it's clearly Skubal's to win.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> DeGrom missed the top 10 last time, but since then, he has shown every indication of ramping back up to his historic level of stifling run prevention. He's doing it a little differently than he did in his Mets heyday, emphasizing pitch efficiency to a greater extent.</p><p>DeGrom's 26% strikeout rate is his lowest in nearly a decade, and he has reached double digits in whiffs just once this season. But he has a sparkling 2.32 ERA and has been at 2.20 over eight starts since the last Awards Watch. He had a string of five straight starts when he threw at least six innings, reaching seven twice, all without hitting the 90-pitch mark.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Crochet has been coming on like gangbusters, as has the team around him. He finished his first half with a complete-game, three-hit shutout of Tampa Bay, closing the AXE gap between him and Skubal. Crochet leads the AL in innings pitched (129⅓), strikeouts (160) and ERA+ (185). We've seen Skubal do this for a full season; now, it's up to Crochet to prove he can match the reigning Cy Young winner start for start in what's shaping up as a great race.</p><hr><p><strong>National League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"cdfd69c1-1b9b-30fe-acf4-aad457b0850e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719507/paul-skenes\">Paul Skenes</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> (150 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2. <a data-player-guid=\"150fa88b-caca-cd7c-3ea9-353c2a361244\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31267/zack-wheeler\">Zack Wheeler</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> (148); 3. <a data-player-guid=\"8a57ca6c-4738-321a-a2aa-54eb43e2d96b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42359/cristopher-sanchez\">Cristopher Sanchez</a>, Phillies (143); 4. <a data-player-guid=\"5f496806-d3fa-4226-e557-dc945eda4f3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39636/mackenzie-gore\">MacKenzie Gore</a>, Nationals (135); 5. <a data-player-guid=\"83c3dc73-d5c3-4be0-d9df-93f264e72220\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36071/nick-pivetta\">Nick Pivetta</a>, Padres (133); 6. <a data-player-guid=\"a2a28cf0-f1f0-f347-a089-692e3da7b293\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39817/ranger-suarez\">Ranger Suarez</a>, Phillies (132); 7.

Recently, I re-pitched the notion of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45575126/2025-mlb-pitcher-wins-paul-skenes-new-formula-game-scores-analytics\">a revised win-loss record based on game scores</a>, so that's worth taking a fresh look at to see if the difference in the traditional records is misleading.</p><p>Well, it is and it isn't. Skenes has suffered a string of hard-luck game score losses of late and now sits at 11-9 by that method. Wheeler, meanwhile, is an MLB-best 16-3. Wheeler also has a solid edge in average game score at 65.2, as compared to 63.2 for Skenes. For now, Wheeler has the edge.</p><p>Will it last? Consider another byproduct of that game score work: pitcher temperature. You win a game score matchup, the temp goes up. You lose, it goes down. Each starter begins his career at the average temperature of 72 degrees, and it goes back and forth from there. The hottest starter in baseball by this method: Wheeler, at 127.2 degrees. Because of his recent bad run, Skenes has cooled to 68.7 degrees.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> For now, Sanchez has seized the spot just behind Wheeler, which of course makes him a mere No. 2 in his own rotation. Sanchez was overlooked when the NL All-Star rosters were released, and it was a true oversight. Like Wheeler, Sanchez has been fiery hot, with a string of excellent outings since the last Awards Watch. Over nine starts during that span, Sanchez has 1.77 ERA and 2.11 FIP, while pitching seven innings or more six times.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Let's just stick with our Phillies theme and keep our eyes on their whole rotation. Wheeler (second), Sanchez (third) and Suarez (sixth) are entrenched in the top 10. Meanwhile, <a data-player-guid=\"31b52969-26e1-6862-3e22-cb52673d5fd4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39667/jesus-luzardo\">Jesus Luzardo</a> (126 AXE), who led this category last time out, just missed giving the Phillies four rotation members in the top 10. Philadelphia leads the majors in average game score and is second in the NL (behind Cincinnati) in game score win-loss percentage.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Rookie of the Year</h2><p><strong>American League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"e2195f6a-a0a0-a5fc-2c5c-ead7e3ebd05a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719300/jacob-wilson\">Jacob Wilson</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"1d8ed3a9-4c7d-0941-3677-bb6defe67c7a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ath/athletics-athletics\">Athletics</a> (121 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2. <a data-player-guid=\"ec3efeaa-14f5-3935-be93-805a36276ce2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5012120/carlos-narvaez\">Carlos Narvaez</a>, Red Sox (120); 3. <a data-player-guid=\"eb3c83c3-4277-3fcc-bc07-dbd57f7253df\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080766/cam-smith\">Cam Smith</a>, Astros (116); 4. <a data-player-guid=\"9f2297a0-32f0-3c3e-abe9-537942d36f4b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4417208/noah-cameron\">Noah Cameron</a>, Royals (115); 5. <a data-player-guid=\"3c91bc94-f039-3293-8b62-e6371ebaea0b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4966637/nick-kurtz\">Nick Kurtz</a>, Athletics (108); 6. <a data-player-guid=\"dff39eef-0f97-3e78-879b-6536b1ecf37d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42664/jake-mangum\">Jake Mangum</a>, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f8a579c6-08b9-7584-141d-317d0645763b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a> (107); 7.

He was hitting .348 at the last Awards Watch then went out and pushed that number to .372 on June 8. Since then, Wilson has hit just .222 and has just three extra-base hits over 24 games. Wilson's quick beginning turned enough heads to get him voted as the AL's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game. But he has been replaced by Smith as the AL Rookie of the Year favorite at ESPN BET.</p><p><strong>Biggest mover:</strong> Smith has mashed his way into prominence, but he's proving to be a well-rounded young hitter despite just 32 games of minor league experience. Alas, his surprising .277 batting average is driven by a .378 BABIP that doesn't seem likely to hold up. However, Smith has just seven homers, and if his game power starts to match his raw power, he can easily replace any loss in average with a gain in slugging.</p><p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Kurtz has been picking up the pace, especially in the power category, manifesting what was his calling card prior to reaching the majors. Kurtz hit the IL with a hip injury on the day the last Awards Watch went out. He had just started to drive the ball before getting hurt, and he has gone right on slugging since he came back. After homering just once over his first 23 games, Kurtz has since gone deep 16 times in 35 contests while slugging .713 in the process.</p><hr><p><strong>National League</strong></p><p><strong>Front-runner: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"dffe573b-a9b5-3fdc-8932-fa202585a91b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5007615/caleb-durbin\">Caleb Durbin</a>, Brewers (113 AXE)</p><p><strong>Next nine:</strong> 2.

The 6-foot-3, 242-pound dual-threat quarterback can not only beat defenses with his powerful arm (2,534 passing yards and 18 touchdowns to seven interceptions as a 19-year-old redshirt freshman) but also with his legs (674 rushing yards and seven touchdowns).</p><p>Sellers showed drastic improvement as a first-year starter, helping the Gamecocks win six of their final seven games last season.

He doesn't take many sacks (his 2.9% sack percentage was 12th lowest in the FBS), but can be reckless and put the ball in harm's way -- especially after breaking the pocket. This showed against ranked teams, as he had three games of two or more interceptions against those opponents.</p><p>While Nussmeier's aggressiveness can work against him, he has the smarts, accuracy and anticipation to be a top pick in the draft. Scouts will want to see more consistency and how he adjusts to a new set of receivers out of the transfer portal.

He can stand and deliver in the pocket with ease and is extremely accurate -- his 5.1% off-target percentage last season was the best in the FBS. He also excelled throwing outside of the pocket, with a 91.1 QBR.

The 6-3, 265-pound Parker is the most likely non-quarterback to be selected first, combining a good first step with strong hands to disengage at the point of attack.</p><p>Those hands help him win by overpowering blockers, and he finished his sophomore season with 11 sacks and 16.5 tackles for loss, second-most in the FBS among defensive linemen. He has also been a turnover creator, forcing four fumbles last season (also second in the FBS) and stands out in a loaded Clemson defensive front.</p><p>\"I know [defensive tackle Peter] Woods gets a lot of the love, but Parker is the one that could be drafted first off of that defense this year,\" an AFC assistant told me this summer.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/251.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2><a data-player-guid=\"d499f837-dace-3ada-8168-eaaa41b706e3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4870906/arch-manning\" target=\"_new\">Arch Manning</a>, QB, Texas</h2><p><b>Predicted chance of going No. 1:</b> 5%</p><p><b>Why he could be the top pick:</b> There's a lot of projection here, as Manning has only two starts and 95 passing attempts in his college career. Because of that, I don't believe Manning will be in the 2026 draft. But he has traits that could make him an intriguing option atop the draft if he has a big season.</p><p>The glimpses we saw last season were promising, as he threw for 939 yards, nine touchdowns and two interceptions while rushing for 106 yards and four scores. At 6-4, 222 pounds, Manning has the frame scouts covet and uses it effectively. He has a picture-perfect base and smooth delivery, and his dual-threat capability forces defenses to account for his running.</p><p>There is plenty for Manning to work on. He must become better at progressing past his first read, as his tendency to stick to it leads to bad decisions and forced throws. He also needs to use his mobility more and be more willing to scramble on dropbacks. That's why I expect him to stick with Texas coach Steve Sarkisian, one of the best quarterback developers in the nation, and not rush to the NFL.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Long shots</h2><h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/redesign/assets/img/icons/ESPN-icon-football-college.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></h2><h2>The 'out-of-nowhere' quarterback</h2><p>Since <a data-player-guid=\"e6957db5-5b2e-a82d-c788-d889115d9772\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\" target=\"_new\">Joe Burrow</a>'s magical 2019 season catapulted him to the top in the 2020 draft, it has been common for under-the-radar quarterbacks to shoot up draft boards high into Round 1.

It looked like he might become the first player in the recent history of <span>Napoli</span> to be officially assigned the iconic No. 10 jersey that once belonged to Diego Maradona after he was spotted on the first day of training ahead of the 2025-26 season with his new team wearing the training kit with a small number 10, which was immediately noticed by fans on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, it's the No. 11, but wearing the No. 10 would have been a huge deal. Here's why:</p>\n<h2>Why it's a special number</h2><p>The Napoli No. 10 bring us back to the 1980s and early 1990s when the legendary Maradona played for Napoli, winning the first two Serie A titles in the history of the club and one UEFA Cup. Maradona, probably the greatest player in the history of the game, played for Napoli from 1984 to 1991, reshaping the history of the club and the Italian Serie A. Back then, numbers were not assigned to players, but it depended on who was going on the pitch, and the number 10 was worn by the most talented attacking player on the pitch, and this is why when Maradona was on the pitch, it was his number.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/the-legacy-of-diego-maradona-how-napolis-owner-used-a-fake-contract-to-bring-argentinas-star-to-serie-a/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>The legacy of Diego Maradona: How Napoli's owner used a fake contract to bring Argentina's star to Serie A</p>\n                <p>\n                    Francesco Porzio                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"The legacy of Diego Maradona: How Napoli's owner used a fake contract to bring Argentina's star to Serie A\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2022/11/25/42baf8f8-c579-4ab3-9743-c270e6cbb7ce/thumbnail/270x152/51c789125ef6c69e39c8841e83fc5e1d/untitled-design-92.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Who wore it after Maradona?</h2><p>Serie A teams started to assign numbers to players in the second part of the 1990s and this is why in 2000 the club decided to retire the number 10 as an homage to the player that shaped the history of the Italian club over the seven years he played for Napoli.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>However, after the club went bankrupt and was acquired by the current owner, Italian businessman Aurelio De Laurentiis, Napoli were relegated to the third division, where numbers are assigned to players for each game, and they had to print jerseys again with the number 10 on the back.&nbsp;</p><p>On April 2006, Argentinian striker Roberto Carlos Sosa became the last player in the history of the team to wear and also score against <span>Frosinone</span> with the Napoli jersey number 10 at the Stadio San Paolo, now called Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>If De Bruyne were to wear the iconic number, it would have been&nbsp;a revolutionary decision for both the player and the club, as nobody had the courage to do that before in a city where Maradona is more than a soccer legend.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Mickelson distilled at the par-three 3rd!</strong> His tee shot plugs under the lip of a pot bunker. It’s almost impossible to escape. He opens the face of his wedge and lashes hard … but even this genius can’t get the ball out. It slams into the face and rolls back into the middle of the trap. But take two is something else. He swishes smoothly, sending his ball high, landing it 15 feet to the right of the pin, and using a combination of camber and spin to roll serenely into the cup! Par. You knew that was going in once it took it’s left-turn screech and rolled out. He raises both arms in the air as the crowd go wild. He remains at -1. That’s one of the shots of the week <em>already</em>. Disaster averted in sensational style, and with such skill and panache. Mickelson in microcosm.

already apologising for a Fleetwood profanity and then the normally genial Englishman lets out a bellowing “fuck” as he finds a bunker off the tee at 5. Language Timothy. It’s revealing though, hinting at the frustration of a bogey caused by another visit to the sand at 4. It’s a poor lie and his escape catches a bit of mound above the lip but flies clear. He has work to do for his par though. Perhaps Fleetwood was listenting to Robert MacIntyre earlier this week when the Scot said he had to get his anger out rather than hold it within when things weren’t going his way on the course.</p></article><article id=\"block-687914a38f0816d26306befd\"><header></header><p><strong>Back to the weather.</strong> Yes, a post office queue has nothing on this blog when it comes to discussing the elements. Here’s Jason Day speaking after 2-over 73: “The weather here is the craziest weather pattern I’ve ever experienced in my life. There’s no consistency to it whatsoever. You look at the weather. I mean, I’d love to be a weatherman here. You just get it wrong all the time.” Yep, even some of the UK’s most genius weathermen would struggle to predict what happens next. In order I’d go Giles, Scott, Fish … Kettley.</p><p>Rory latest: a par at 4. His approach from that decent lie up the left went bounding through the green but out came the short-game skills to help him save par. It’s a steady enough opening in terms of scoring but he’d swap it with Lucas Glover's flying start: birdie-eagle-par. The 2009 US Open champ is -3 and tied fifth.</p></article><article id=\"block-687912fe8f085b91d1059d2e\"><header></header><p><strong>Christiaan Bezuidenhout is flying up the leaderboard and sits at -3 after 8 thanks to a hat-trick of birdies at 5, 6 and 7.</strong> It would be some story if the South African were to win here. Back in 2014 he was banned from playing in the Amateur Championship at Royal Portrush due to the use of beta blockers. The reason is pretty remarkable: he swallowed rat poison as a toddler and was using them to cope with anxiety and a speech impediment. A lovely bloke, he has to deal with it still today. It’s a fanastic start and note that Bezuidenhout posted 12th at the US Open last month so he has some recent form in a major.</p></article><article id=\"block-687911b08f08047e0893da7f\"><header></header><p><strong>Rory’s birdie try at 3 just slips but, of far more concern, is that he appears to be having an attack of the lefts from the tee.</strong> For the second time in four holes he pulls his driver in an unseemly arc from right to left and finds trouble. Or does he? When the camera reveals his ball, it’s sitting up just fine. Up at the 4th green, Viktor Hovland has been in trouble and needs to knock in a testy little bogey putt. The Norwegian drops back to -1.</p></article><article id=\"block-687910728f085b91d1059ce5\"><header></header><p><strong>Thanks Scott.</strong> Yes, I’m just back in from watching Rory’s start and it’s probably the best weather of the day. Twenty degrees, winds modest. And yet I heard a couple of marshals mentioning thunderstorms. A quick visual sweep of the horizon certainly showed no signs of any dark clouds but it can change very quickly in these parts. And the official Met forecast does have a yellow thunderstorm warning. It also suggests a 70% chance of rain each hour until close of play. We shall see. Bryson DeChambeau feels it’s warm enough to be wearing short sleeves although he’ll be a bit under the collar now after a double bogey at 4 drops him to +2.</p></article><article id=\"block-68790f2d8f08b26a1e2a942e\"><header></header><p><strong>… and with that, I’ll hand over to our man in situ, David Tindall.</strong> Enjoy the rest of the first round; I’ll see you again early in the morning.</p><p><em>-4: JS Olesen (F), Li (F), Fitzpatrick (F)<br>\n  -3: Jordan (F), Scheffler (F)<br>\n  -2: N Hojgaard (F), Westwood (F), Kaewkanjana (13), Kawamoto (13), Garcia (10), Hidalgo (8), Bezuidenhout (6), Rai (6), McNealy (5), Hovland (3)</em></p></article><article id=\"block-68790e5a8f085b91d1059c9b\"><header><h2>Scheffler shoots 68; Lowry 70</h2></header><p><strong>Scottie Scheffler is this close to ending his round with three consecutive birdies.</strong> Inches wide with a 30-foot putt on 18. But he’s signing for a very welcome opening round of 68, and if he can sort his driver out on the range later – with a driving accuracy of 21.4 percent today, the world number one is ranked 135th in that category – he’ll be pretty much unstoppable this week. He’s -3, a couple of strokes ahead of the home hero Shane Lowry, who pars the last for a 70. Wild scenes he walked up the 18th again, by the way. Not quite the level of Sunday in 2019, how could it be? But it was something, nonetheless.</p></article><article id=\"block-68790d448f08b26a1e2a93f1\"><header></header><p><strong>Bob MacIntyre makes his first birdie of the week, fair rattling in a 12-foot putt on 3.</strong> Meanwhile it’s a one-under round of 70 for Jon Rahm, and a level-par opening round of 71 for the defending champion Xander Schauffele. A few players making good while the sun shines, which it’s doing at the moment. Rain incoming according to the forecast, though, with the possibility of a few dangerous thunderclaps. Fingers crossed the latter doesn’t materialise.</p></article><article id=\"block-68790bd38f085b91d1059c7f\"><header></header><p><strong>McIlroy isn’t taking any chances from the thick rough down the left of 2.</strong> He lays up. Then from 115 yards he screws his approach to a halt 15 feet from the pin. A big birdie putt coming up. Make it, and he would change the mood around this match, with the gallery a little bit muted after his equally subdued start. And in it goes! Pretty much straight into the hole when plenty of players have been missing wide right, some local knowledge to the fore, right there. The gallery erupts and he’s back to level par quicksmart.</p><figure id=\"1b74ec4c-e877-4910-9dcd-74974e232687\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fe7bf6d8b17b291925ff406e7b5720ea0a0c78/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fe7bf6d8b17b291925ff406e7b5720ea0a0c78/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=700&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fe7bf6d8b17b291925ff406e7b5720ea0a0c78/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fe7bf6d8b17b291925ff406e7b5720ea0a0c78/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland chips out of the rough on the 2nd hole.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fe7bf6d8b17b291925ff406e7b5720ea0a0c78/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\" height=\"310.1513671875\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland chips out of the rough on the 2nd hole.</span> Photograph: Peter Morrison/AP</figcaption></figure></article><article id=\"block-68790b108f085b91d1059c67\"><header></header><p><strong>A couple of big putts dropping.</strong> Viktor Hovland rakes one in across 2 for eagle, and he’s -2 in short order.

Raj was nearly 33.</p><p>\"If you are from an affluent family, you can manage to play for however long, because you do not really have to think about how you are going to run your house,\" she says. \"But if you are not, you would think, what next? Where am I going to earn money?</p><p>\"Contracts gave that safety for the national players. They know, 'OK, I can play and I can earn'.

It really doubled up the sort of coverage that women's cricket needed.\"</p><p>India lost to the hosts but it was a ground-breaking match. It was sold out, and according to India's Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) the final generated 19.53 million impressions in India, making it the most watched female sports event in the country, beating the badminton final at the Rio Olympics between PV Sindhu and Carolina Marin.</p><p>After that final, the pay for contracted top-tier international players rose from a reported 15 lakh to 50 lakh.</p><p>By 2020, Star Sports were broadcasting India's matches at the Women's T20 World Cup in five different languages. India's defeat by Australia in the final was watched in India by a record live average audience of 9.02 million according to the ICC.</p><p>After reaching, and losing, another final, this time in front of a record crowd of 86,174 at the MCG, the BCCI raised women's international match fees to be equal with men's in 2022.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"Advent-of-the-Womens-Premier-League\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">Advent of the Women's Premier League</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"image-block\"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"><img alt=\"Mumbai Indians celebrate winning the 2025 Women's Premier League\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/a5d7/live/9b388f00-631a-11f0-83d2-4f671b8c1523.jpg 976w\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2159.6832937450513\"></picture></span><span role=\"text\"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Mumbai Indians won the 2025 WPL, after winning the inaugural edition in 2023</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The women's cricket world had long been waiting for the women's version of the Indian Premier League (IPL). When it finally arrived in 2023 it exploded onto the scene with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/64399097\">five teams bought for £465m</a> and Viacom buying the media rights for £96m over five years.</p><p>Smriti Mandhana was the most expensive player, bought for a jaw-dropping <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/64624097\">£340,000</a> by Royal Challengers Bengaluru.</p><p>The competition turned a profit and <a href=\"https://sportsmintmedia.com/bcci-posts-inr-9741-7-cr-in-fy-2023-24-revenue-as-ipl-dominates-earnings-mix/\">contributed around 3.9%<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> of the BCCI's revenue in the 2023-24 financial year. That is over-shadowed by the IPL's contribution of 59.10%, but it is vindication of the BCCI waiting until the market was right.</p><p>The WPL offers potentially life-changing sums for up to 90 players (up to 30 of which could be overseas). Outside of the WPL however, there are no contracts for domestic cricketers in India, only match fees.</p><p>One BCCI official has said players who don't have a WPL deal \"fend for themselves\". If they are lucky, they may have a personal sponsor, mentor or advocate who supports them financially. Some players may have jobs in the same way that Raj was employed by Railways.</p><p>This is the same structure that exists in the men's domestic game across India, with no contracts at state level.</p><p>The number of women's retainers has increased marginally, with 16 women awarded in 2024-25. These contracts require annual renewal, and don't offer maternity clauses. There are 34 BCCI retainers available to men.</p><p>In a country of 1.4 billion, where the BCCI's Under-15s girls' competition alone sees 36 teams and potentially 540 players competing (numbers replicated at U19 and U23 level), WPL pay packets reach the few rather than the many. But the money to be chased has changed attitudes around girls' cricket.</p><p>\"Now it is not looked down upon,\" says a smiling Raj. \"Cricket is a profession, it's a sport, and everybody is keen to get their girls to play cricket. That's a huge, huge shift.\"</p><p>The crowds and media attention on the WPL has helped to accustom domestic players to big-stage cricket before they play for the national side.</p><p>The tournament also helps enormously with talent scouting.</p><p>\"India is a very big country, so the selectors cannot go to every state and identify players,\" says Raj. \"The franchises have scouts they send to every part of the country. They pick players who are raw, who have been not seen before, and they get an opportunity.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"What-of-the-future\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">What of the future?</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>A clear pathway exists to the women's national team, through club, district, state, zone, India A then India. However, barriers still remain.</p><p>\"There is a lot of raw talent in the districts and in the villages,\" says Raj. \"It's just that they don't have the facilities if a young girl in the interiors wants to start playing cricket.</p><p>\"The society in the villages - it still needs to progress. And the financial barrier is huge. I'm associated with Andhra Cricket Association and I went into these districts and there were a few girls who did not have money for three meals in a day. The associations have to make an effort to get into these places and give them basic facilities.</p><p>\"But otherwise, to play cricket in India now, it's far more open and easier than before.</p><p>She concludes: \"The next step is to add a couple more teams to WPL, because there are many good players who get left out with just five teams.</p><p>\"And of course winning the World Cup.\"</p><p>However, as Raj sees it, the prize that would propel the Indian game forward exponentially would be Olympic gold, with cricket in LA 2028.</p><p>\"It's a chance to get a medal for the country. I know we have the World Cups, but the medal in the Olympics is a huge thing back at home.</p><p>\"The Olympics is the ultimate.\"</p></div><section data-component=\"links-block\"><p><h2 type=\"normal\">More on this story</h2></p><ul role=\"list\"><li></li></ul></section></article></main></div></div>"

The NFL learning curve is steep and they often find themselves working to earn trust during the early portion of the season. However, they can still provide a lot of upside if you're not overdrafting, just as Buccaneers running back Bucky Irving did last season. Irving was the 55th running back off the board on average, but finished as RB12 in CBS Sports PPR leagues last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a reliable set of live-updated 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you identify potential 2025 Fantasy football breakouts like Irving was last year, while also avoiding overhyped rookies. Before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>Last year, the model accurately predicted that Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels would comfortably outperform his ADP (QB13). The result: Daniels threw for 3,568 yards and 25 touchdowns with only nine interceptions and added 891 rushing yards with six more scores on the ground to take home NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. He finished as QB5 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and was a great addition to Fantasy football lineups.</p><p>The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.</p>\n        \n\n<p>&nbsp;The model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy Football sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking. The 2025 Fantasy football PPR rankings and 2025 Fantasy football standard rankings update multiple times daily, so you're always getting the best Fantasy football advice.</p><p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson. New England spent the No. 38 overall pick on Henderson with the clear intent on upgrading their running game to help second-year quarterback Drake Maye reach his full potential. The Ohio State back rushed for 3,761 yards and 42 touchdowns in four years with the Buckeyes and led the Big Ten in yards per carry twice.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Now his quickest way to regular touches will be as a home-run hitter for the Patriots. Rhamondre Stevenson is coming off a disappointing season, but is still a short-yardage chain-mover at 230 pounds and is likely to have a role, while Antonio Gibson will also be a factor. However, neither have the recent production to block Henderson if he can learn the offense, and the model ranks him as their No. 2 rookie running back and also ranks him ahead of established backs like Najee Harris and Isiah Pacheco.</p><p>Another potential breakout that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a> wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/fantasy/\">Travis Hunter</a>, who has an over/under of 750.5 receiving yards. A lot is being made about how much he'll play on both sides of the ball and how it may cut into his production offensively. However, Hunter regularly handled well over 100 snaps per game at Colorado and the Jaguars desperately need a receiver opposite Brian Thomas Jr. to balance the passing attack.</p><p>Hunter led the Big 12 in receptions (96) and receiving touchdowns (15) while also ranking second in the conference and fifth nationally in receiving yards (1,258). He's got high-level body control and proven athleticism, and the model predicts that he outperforms receivers like Jameson Williams and Darnell Mooney, who both finished top 25 in the NFL in receiving yards last season.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">See which other Fantasy football breakouts 2025 to pick here</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankings</h2><p>SportsLine is also extremely high on a rookie running back to make an immediate impact. The model ranks this player as a top-10 option ahead of more established stars like Christian McCaffrey and Bucky Irving.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025 Fantasy Football breakouts should you target, and which RB shocks the NFL with a top-10 performance? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=07072025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetsbreakouts\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get 2025 Fantasy Football cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that called Jayden Daniels' breakout rookie season</a>, and find out.</strong></p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

After moving from North Toronto Nitros, Smith's breakthrough came for Sporting CP during her first professional season in 2023-24 as she scored 13 goals in 18 appearances.</p><p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/football/story?_slug_=summer-transfer-window-grading-big-signings-womens-soccer&amp;id=45581462\" target=\"_blank\">Summer transfer window grades: Arsenal get an A for Smith</a><br>\n- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/39523259/women-world-transfer-record-history-smith-overtakes-girma\" target=\"_blank\">Women's world transfer record history: Smith overtakes Girma</a></strong></p><p>In summer 2024, Liverpool signed her for a club-record fee of just over £200,000, and she scored seven times in 20 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/eng.w.1\" target=\"_blank\">Women's Super League</a> appearances -- almost a third of the club's total goals last season.</p><p>Here is a look at why Arsenal decided to spend big to sign her.</p><h2>What position does she play?</h2><p>Smith is a right-footed winger who primarily operates on the right side; although, she is capable of playing through the middle as a central striker. During the 2024-25 season, she largely played as a part of a front two in Liverpool's 3-5-2 formation, or as the right winger in their 4-2-3-1 setup.</p><p>Either way, she was awarded freedom to move around up front and often dropped deeper to receive the ball with her back to goal, before turning and running at her opponents.</p><h2>What are her strengths?</h2><p>Her primary strengths lie in her dribbling ability. She has a lot of speed, but also the ability to change direction instantly -- choosing to head inside or outside equally well -- which adds a layer of unpredictability to her game. Her close control in tight spaces and ability to bounce off challenges also makes her a nightmare to defend against.</p><p>Smith played for a Liverpool side that was direct in its buildup, which limited her time and touches on the ball, but she was excellent when in possession. The stat of \"progressive carries per 100 open-play touches\" gives you an idea of how frequently a player attempts to make a progressive carry, and the winger is in the top quartile for both attempted take-ons and normalized progressive carries among forwards.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0716/r1519812_999x999_1-1.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>She is in good company alongside <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f6c1de4b-73c3-ba7f-207e-ec5927d015c5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=19970\">Chelsea</a> duo of Johanna Rytting Kaneyrd and <a data-player-guid=\"68517232-9c81-368d-8e13-fa7f7d5c7c9e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/288680/mayra-ramirez\">Mayra Ramírez</a>, who are both known for their ball carrying, while she is also accompanied by her new Arsenal teammate <a data-player-guid=\"afa84de8-f20b-01bd-108f-06eaba5c2bde\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158678/caitlin-foord\">Caitlin Foord</a>. Indeed, Smith's 3.6 attempted take-ons (with a 58% success rate) also put her in the top bracket and suggests some stylistic similarities with Foord, which bodes well for her adaptability.</p><p>Smith loves to shoot as well. While primarily right footed, she is good with both feet and took 49 shots last season, the joint-sixth highest by any player in the WSL. That's some feat when you consider Liverpool's general lack of shot-creating ability, and Smith often had to create chances for herself using her pace and skill to create space. Only <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"214681ac-9f95-347a-8505-43b8c2ac6058\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=20707\">Aston Villa</a> duo <a data-player-guid=\"ea643265-26eb-36e9-d761-c9560b0b6687\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/294252/kirsty-hanson\">Kirsty Hanson</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"3fef3b31-5f24-1c8f-7347-2e19a395fe69\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/294246/ebony-salmon\">Ebony Salmon</a>, as well as Manchester City's <a data-player-guid=\"2e85d741-2bf3-4cdf-1fe7-08ce37eec6d6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/281475/kerolin\">Kerolin</a>, created more shots from take-ons (9) than Smith (8). And no player scored more of these opportunities than her (2).</p><p>Smith's quick footedness and repertoire of skills make her difficult to read and allow her to draw fouls. Only West Ham's <a data-player-guid=\"20dacf45-e731-898c-e705-e4a8eccc5fa9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/188069/viviane-asseyi\">Viviane Asseyi</a> (51) won more fouls than Smith (46) in the WSL last season, and nine of those resulted in a shot attempt within the next two actions.</p><p>The youngster also has a knack of making a mark against big sides. She caused a lot of problems for Arsenal in their FA Cup quarterfinal tie and scored against Chelsea, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5d1de908-8705-f172-5351-5271a4f2e5a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=20061\">Manchester United</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"05226548-2c4b-0170-ef96-91e0fe9ab498\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=19257\">Manchester City</a> across all competitions last season.</p><h2>What does she need to work on?</h2><p>There are questions around how Smith will play in a more possession-dominant side. The winger played for a Liverpool side that averaged 47.4% possession last season and relied on opportunities in transition, often against unsettled defenses with yards of space to run into.</p><p>However, the Gunners averaged the second-highest possession in the WSL last season (62.5%) and constantly faced defenses set up in a low block with players behind the ball.</p><p>While Smith's quick-footed nature is a major part of her dribbling armory, the lack of space in behind might hinder the impact of her overall dribbling, which could result in some unwanted turnovers and a slight drop in her dribble success rate.</p><h2>How will Smith fit in with Arsenal's tactical plan?</h2><p>Renée Slegers retained some key aspects of Jonas Eidevall's tactics after taking over from him in October, but she also added her own spin.</p><p>Under her guidance, Arsenal's wingers are asked to move the ball up the pitch due to their direct ball carrying nature, especially since Chloe Kelly's arrival, but are also trusted to shoot and cross the ball frequently.</p><p>Without the ball, though, they are expected to contribute to the team's press and engage with the opposition backline in their own third. Smith fits like a glove in this philosophy; she is an active defender with a brilliant work rate and is always a key component of her side's front-footed approach.</p><p>Only Arsenal's <a data-player-guid=\"d8df9431-2532-e582-2043-259fa43c9b1a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257473/mariona-caldentey\">Mariona Caldentey</a> (24) made more tackles in the final third than the Liverpool starlet (20) last season. And, among forwards, only Manchester United's <a data-player-guid=\"cdec20cd-7518-3300-9d22-94326f4a5d6c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/328108/celin-bizet\">Celin Bizet</a> (98), Chelsea's Kaneryd (90) and Asseyi (88) made more ball recoveries than Smith (77) last season.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0716/r1519814_999x999_1-1.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Why did Arsenal want her?</h2><p>Aside from adding a young player of considerable quality, Arsenal had the second-oldest squad in the WSL last season (27.6 years of age), behind only Aston Villa (27.7). A lot of their important players, in terms of minutes played, are heading away from their peak, so Smith's addition is an influx of youth. Indeed, she joins <a data-player-guid=\"69f39bc0-2cb4-e551-a6ab-3033c0444e38\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/288907/kyra-cooney-cross\">Kyra Cooney-Cross</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"040d9088-247a-3774-b136-bbe2a373e7fc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/350636/rosa-kafaji\">Rosa Kafaji</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"60f8f89a-4689-a983-305a-3043fe546737\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/259331/frida-maanum\">Frida Maanum</a> among the players who recently arrived at the club age 21 or younger.</p><p>At 20, she brings down the average age in attack, adding depth and should also be eligible for a homegrown slot in the next couple of seasons, which will help Arsenal with player registration.</p><p>While her world-record transfer fee might weigh heavy on her shoulders, Smith seems capable of carrying it and has already proven how effective she can be in the WSL.</p>\n</div></div>"

Winnipeg (3-1), which had a bye in Week 6, will be looking to avenge a 37-16 setback against Calgary in its last outing.</p><p>Week 7 gets underway Thursday, when the reigning Grey Cup champion Toronto Argonauts (1-4) travel to Molson Stadium to face the Montreal Alouettes (3-2) at 7:30 p.m. ET. The East Division rivals are meeting for the second time this year, as Montreal posted a 28-10 home victory against Toronto in the season opener for each club. The Argonauts and Alouettes both were idle last week following Week 5 defeats, with Toronto losing a 51-38 shootout with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Montreal dropping a 21-20 decision to the BC Lions.</p><p>Saskatchewan (4-1) will be looking to bounce back from its first loss of the year when it visits BC (3-3) on Saturday at 7 p.m. ET at BC Place. The Roughriders opened the season with a four-game winning streak that included a 37-18 home victory over the Lions in Week 4. BC is seeking its third consecutive win after rolling past the Edmonton Elks 32-14 on the road last week.</p><p>Hamilton (3-2) and the Ottawa Redblacks (1-5) wrap up Week 7 when they clash at 7 p.m. ET on Sunday at TD Place. The Tiger-Cats extended their winning streak to three games with a 23-20 triumph over the Redblacks at home last week. The loss was the third in a row for Ottawa, which won both of its home meetings with Hamilton last season.</p><p>Montreal is a 10.5-point favorite against Toronto at FanDuel Sportsbook, while Calgary is a 3.5-point underdog versus Winnipeg. BC is favored by 2.5 points in its matchup with Saskatchewan, and Hamilton is -1.5 against Ottawa.</p><p>SportsLine football expert Emory Hunt has gone 15-8 on his CFL picks this year and has revealed his selections for Week 7 of the 2025 CFL season, including against-the-spread predictions and leans on the total of every game.</p><p>Hunt is the founder and CEO of Football Gameplan, which has been supplying analysis of all levels of football since 2007. He is a former running back for the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns and knows the game from a player's perspective. Hunt's dedication to analysis of all levels of professional football&nbsp;<strong>helped him crush the CFL, XFL, and USFL in 2023, posting a combined ATS record of 98-73 in his SportsLine articles.</strong></p><h3>Toronto Argonauts at Montreal Alouettes (Thursday, 7:30 p.m. ET)</h3><p><strong>Pick: Toronto +10.5</strong><br><strong>Lean: Over 50.5</strong></p><p>Both teams are coming off a bye week, and both also are coming off losses. Expect the Argonauts and Alouettes to be looking to get back on the winning track and establish a new level of consistency moving forward. A 10.5-point spread seems very high in this critical East Division matchup.</p><h3>Calgary Stampeders at Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Friday, 8:30 p.m. ET)</h3><p><strong>Pick: Winnipeg -3.5</strong><br><strong>Lean: Over 49.5</strong></p><p>The last time these teams met, the Stampeders put on an offensive display. Right now, Calgary looks like the best team in the CFL and is playing really good football. However, this is usually a spot where the Blue Bombers show up and remind folks why they've been so consistent over the last few years. Especially now, as they are coming in fresh off a bye week.</p><h3>Saskatchewan Roughriders at BC Lions (Saturday, 7 p.m. ET)</h3><p><strong>Pick: BC -2.5</strong><br><strong>Lean: Over 52.5</strong></p><p>The Lions really stepped up defensively against Edmonton last weekend. Now, that could just be because of a bad Elks offense, or the fact that BC's front seven has found its groove. I'm willing to say the truth lies somewhere in the middle and we should get a fun, back-and-forth game with a lot of points scored. I'm giving the edge to the home team.</p><h3>Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Ottawa Redblacks (Sunday, 7 p.m. ET)</h3><p><strong>Pick: Hamilton -1.5</strong><br><strong>Lean: Under 54.5</strong></p><p>Rematches always are interesting, especially ones that take place a week later. What I noticed when these teams met in Week 6 was how easy it was for the Tiger-Cats to move the ball and generate some offense. The Redblacks have the talent, but it seemed like a struggle for them to move the ball after their first drive. This spread is close enough to where I can trust Hamilton on the road in this spot.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Nothing too bad,” Pogacar tells Matt Stephens after his crash yesterday. “My whole left arm is open, burned off skin. And I hit my hip a little bit and my shoulder, but luckily I was back on the bike quite fast. Today is another day. It’s not the first time I crashed and continued the race. It’s more important the legs than my arm. I have a super-strong team around me. I am so grateful I can rely on them, even if I have a hard day today, but I hope not. “It’s really sad to lose another young talent,” Pogacar says of Samuele Privitera’s death at the Giro della Valle d’Aosta yesterday. “It’s devastating. It’s one of the most dangerous sports in the world. Sometimes the risks we are taking are too far. I’m really sad for all his family. May he rest in peace … he deserves to “not be bothered” now.

Miller was released earlier this offseason by the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a>, with whom he spent the last three seasons after playing 9.5 seasons with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a> and a half-season (that included a <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> victory) with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a>.</p><p>Miller is one of the most successful pass rushers in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history. His 129.5 sacks are first among active players and 25th-most all time. Of course, he's not the same player he once was, which makes sense because he's now 36 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the realities of his age and somewhat diminished skill set, it's worth considering what the Commanders defense -- which does have a significant need for pass-rush help -- should reasonably expect out of a player like him.&nbsp;</p><p>And thanks to our friends at Tru Media, we can take a look at the recent history of these types of designated veteran pass rushers -- guys who were 35 years old or older at the start of the season, and who could reasonably be considered edge defenders. When looking into the data, I discovered they've actually fared a bit better than I thought they would have.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Player</th><th>Season</th><th>Team</th><th>Snaps</th><th>TFL</th><th>Sacks</th><th>Hits</th><th>Hurries</th><th>Pressures</th></tr><tr><td><a

average, this group of players played 424.8 snaps and racked up 6.2 tackles for loss, 4.6 sacks, 10.4 hits and 20.6 hurries, with the latter three totals combining for an average of 31.2 pressures. If the Commanders get that out of Miller this coming season, that would be considered a pretty good result, considering their relative lack of investment in him. (When the breaking-news reporters don't include the dollar amount in their reports of a signing, you know it's not for very much money at all.)</p>\n        \n\n<p>There are, of course, a few caveats to consider here. First, this is a very small sample size. Including Miller's 2024 campaign, the list above includes only 22 player-seasons. But the data on sacks, hits, hurries and pressures in the Tru Media database only goes back to 2017, so that's all we have to work with here. Therefore, this sample includes, for example, Freeney's three-sack season in Seattle and Detroit in 2017, but not his eight-sack season with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> in 2015 nor his three-sack season with the Falcons in 2016.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest caveat to be aware of here, though, is the concept of survivorship bias. The only edge rushers who even get to play this deep into their 30s are the ones who are so good that they're not forced into retirement before they reach that age. So, you'd expect them to be pretty productive, because otherwise they wouldn't even be able to get onto the field. And indeed, a number of them barely got into the field in their final seasons, with five of the 22 playing fewer than 250 snaps, whether due to injury or age-related decline.</p><p>Miller specifically has been inconsistent in this late stage of his career. He had six sacks and 32 pressures in 13 games last season, but went without a sack and had only 13 pressures in 2023. (He was also suspended for four games last season for violating the league's personal conduct policy after allegedly assaulting his girlfriend in 2023.) He played that season coming off a significant injury suffered the year before, but it's worth noting that he hasn't rediscovered his peak form.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>However, reaching those heights obviously should not be expected at this stage of his career -- and the Commanders probably aren't him to expecting anyway. If he just achieves the averages of the group of players above, and if his contributions are well-timed, Washington will probably consider it a sound investment.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

He's another young offensive star for the NHL to market, having amassed 129 points in 56 games with the Medicine Hat Tigers of the Western Hockey League last season, while drawing comparisons to wingers like <a data-player-guid=\"7646526a-8436-e728-6575-1b1f5d62e0bb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3735/patrick-kane\">Patrick Kane</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"3a576cdf-1ad7-79e3-04f1-a1fba8ab110a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/2563060/nikita-kucherov\">Nikita Kucherov</a>.</p><p>He's hope. He's the future. But presently, Gavin McKenna represents something else entirely in hockey: He embodies the dramatic changes between the NCAA, Canadian Hockey League and the NHL that have altered the path for NHL prospects.</p><p>McKenna shocked the hockey world by opting to leave Canadian junior hockey for Penn State University's men's hockey program. He could have remained in the CHL for another dominant season. Instead, he'll be an 18-year-old freshman battling in the Big Ten against bigger, stronger and more experienced players.</p><p>\"It was a super tough decision. There are a lot of really great options out there. But me, my family and everyone in my circle decided that the best spot for me next year is Penn State,\" he said, announcing his decision on \"SportsCenter.\"</p><p>McKenna's big move comes at a time of radical changes for NHL prospects. Last November, the NCAA ruled that Canadian junior players were now eligible to play on Division I teams, ending a decades-old policy that made young athletes choose between the CHL and college hockey. The new rules go into effect in August, making McKenna one of the first Canadian junior players to make the jump to the NCAA -- and easily the most significant one.</p><p>\"Gavin's elite. He's dominated junior hockey like very few have in the past,\" TSN prospects analyst Craig Button said.</p><p>That historic decision by the NCAA arrived just as college hockey programs were now flush with name, image and likeness (NIL) financial enticements for players. McKenna's NIL money for attending Penn State is \"in the ballpark\" of $700,000, a source tells ESPN. Michigan State, the runner-up for McKenna's commitment, had an NIL offer of around $200,000 to $300,000, according to College Hockey Insider.</p><p>The Nittany Lions men's hockey program joined Division I in 2012, playing for one season as an independent until construction was completed on its new arena, funded primarily by Penn State alum Terry Pegula, owner of the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"06b99a18-3096-3b1f-d339-adab9ac51614\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-sabres\">Buffalo Sabres</a> and Buffalo Bills. Penn State joined the Big Ten in 2013-14 when that conference began sponsoring hockey.</p><p>The progress has been steady for Penn State hockey. In 2015, its first alum made his NHL debut, as Casey Bailey suited up for the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5aa11fc5-b122-f21a-1ddb-a63c5b3dddee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/tor/toronto-maple-leafs\">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>. Penn State won the Big Ten tournament in 2017 and the regular-season title in 2020. The Nittany Lions made the Frozen Four for the first time this past season, losing to Boston University in the semifinals. All the while, they had a state-of-the-art new building and a boisterous home-ice advantage thanks to their raucous student section.</p><p>\"It's a good program. Penn State's got a nice setup,\" said Tony Granato, who coached Wisconsin in the Big Ten from 2016 to 2023. \"They're starting to carve out a little niche for themselves that differentiates them from Michigan or Michigan State or Wisconsin.\"</p><p>Now it has a star whose name could become synonymous with Penn State hockey.</p><p>The Nittany Lions have had eight players drafted by NHL teams. Last month, defenseman Jackson Smith technically became the first Penn State player taken in the first round, the No. 14 pick by the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"724d5dd5-197c-6f1d-29ca-a0b4f25eb1b6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/cbj/columbus-blue-jackets\">Columbus Blue Jackets</a>, although he's an incoming freshman.</p><p>But the idea that the program could produce a No. 1 pick in the NHL draft was outlandish, even in the NIL era. Not anymore. Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky gives all the credit to McKenna for taking that leap of faith with his program.</p><p>\"I think when you talk about Penn State specifically, I think he has a bit of a pioneering mindset. He wants to be the first, and I think he's very comfortable with that pressure,\" Gadowsky said.</p><p>Agent Pat Brisson has worked with other NHL draft phenoms who were selected first overall: <a data-player-guid=\"706fa356-342c-1e1e-dce4-1bdd4d70a33f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3114/sidney-crosby\">Sidney Crosby</a> (2005, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"472f7324-d0ab-e645-bce6-a3cd3dcb110d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-penguins\">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>), <a data-player-guid=\"ff6af87a-96de-67cf-1ff1-16ba3c98f8fa\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/5160/john-tavares\">John Tavares</a> (2009, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"dab46111-bd72-868c-eff2-340e3cfc4d62\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/nyi/new-york-islanders\">New York Islanders</a>) and <a data-player-guid=\"785720c1-56ab-7e87-1d85-0c16c6f27960\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041969/nathan-mackinnon\">Nathan MacKinnon</a> (2013, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"65489e39-7ab7-70da-94bc-adcc6f0aa1c6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/col/colorado-avalanche\">Colorado Avalanche</a>). Now he's working with McKenna, along with Matt Williams, a rising star at CAA.</p><p>\"From the get-go, [Penn State] is where he wanted to go. It was something in his mind that he wanted,\" Brisson told ESPN. \"I've learned one thing about some of these young, special ones: They have that special chip in them. They have these goals in mind that they are special for a reason. I sit with Gavin and I can see in his eyes how the brain is working. It's just unique. It's hard to explain.\"</p><p>Even harder to explain: what the path McKenna and other Canadian junior hockey stars are taking will mean for the sport in the years to come.</p><hr><p><strong>THE SUPREME COURT'S</strong> 2021 decision in NCAA v. Alston allowed for non-scholarship earned income across every division. That's what helped <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/41040485/what-nil-college-sports-how-do-athlete-deals-work\">create NIL allowances in college sports</a>, in which athletes were no longer prohibited from making deals to profit off their name, image and likeness while competing in the NCAA.</p><p>Last month, the NIL landscape shifted dramatically when three separate federal antitrust lawsuits were ended through a $2.8 billion settlement that allowed colleges, going forward, to directly pay student-athletes up to a certain limit. The annual cap is expected to start at <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/45467505/judge-grants-final-approval-house-v-ncaa-settlement\">roughly $20.5 million</a> per school in 2025-26.</p><p>Brisson said the NIL money didn't fuel the decision by McKenna and his family. \"The NIL obviously comes into play, but it's not the primary decision of why he decided to go to college,\" he said. \"It's all about the next step. We viewed this, along with the family, as an opportunity to continue to grow as a player more than anything else.\"</p><p>Granato also believed the NIL money was part of McKenna's decision but not the driving force. The former Wisconsin coach played 13 seasons in the NHL. Granato knows what's awaiting McKenna after next year's draft, and hence doesn't believe NIL money could have been the determining factor here.</p><p>\"Gavin McKenna is going to make more money than he could ever need in a real short period of time. So I don't think it was down to the dollars and cents,\" he said. \"I think it was down to the respect and to the approach that Penn State laid out for him. Obviously, the money was to say how badly they wanted him, but I think that they made a big commitment to try to get their program to be a top team in the country.\"</p><p>Granato said the benefits for Penn State go beyond what happens on the ice next season.</p><p>\"If Gavin McKenna's going to be on TV and in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the next 20 years, and he's going to have a Penn State logo next to him through all the things he's going to accomplish? The value he would bring to the university? I'd say that $700,000 or whatever is probably a pretty cheap investment,\" he said.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,44664061\" data-cerebro-id=\"67fc698f66d5825c92b1635e\" data-title=\"Gavin McKenna scores sensational solo goal in the WHL\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0413%2Fdm_250413_GAVIN_MCKENNA_WHL_GOAL_OF_THE_YEAR%2Fdm_250413_GAVIN_MCKENNA_WHL_GOAL_OF_THE_YEAR.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0413%2Fdm_250413_GAVIN_MCKENNA_WHL_GOAL_OF_THE_YEAR%2Fdm_250413_GAVIN_MCKENNA_WHL_GOAL_OF_THE_YEAR.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0413%2Fdm_250413_GAVIN_MCKENNA_WHL_GOAL_OF_THE_YEAR%2Fdm_250413_GAVIN_MCKENNA_WHL_GOAL_OF_THE_YEAR.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"44664061\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:33</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Gavin McKenna scores sensational solo goal in the WHL</p><p>Top 2026 NHL draft-eligible prospect Gavin McKenna scores a goal-of-the-year candidate in Game 2 of the second-round series between the Medicine Hat Tigers and Prince Albert Raiders.</p></div></div><p>McKenna's decision to go to the NCAA would have been a much more complicated one in the past. The NCAA had deemed anyone who played in the CHL ineligible because there are players who have signed professional contracts with NHL teams playing in those leagues that comprise it: the Ontario Hockey League, Western Hockey League and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. CHL players are also paid a monthly stipend that is capped at $250.</p><p>But in November 2024, the NCAA Division I council voted to make CHL players eligible for NCAA Division I hockey beginning in 2025. The council ruled that players can compete in the CHL without jeopardizing their NCAA Division I hockey eligibility, provided they aren't \"paid more than actual and necessary expenses as part of that participation.\"</p><p>At the time, Western Hockey League commissioner Dan Near put out a statement supporting the NCAA rules changes as a way to \"relieve the tension\" for young players and their families who had to decide between junior hockey and NCAA eligibility.</p><p>\"We stand by that. Just because we're disappointed that Gavin won't play in our league next year doesn't mean that we have this whole different point of view on it,\" Near told ESPN. \"We wish Gavin the best. They had an incredible team in Medicine Hat. He did a lot for the community and the league. I hope he's hugely successful.\"</p><p>Near cautioned against drawing conclusions based on McKenna's chosen path to the NHL.</p><p>\"Gavin McKenna moving on early from the WHL or the CHL is not the same as all of the other changes going on,\" he said. \"It's a notable cog in the wheel for sure. But this is such a giant, complicated environment that we live in right now that's so rapidly changing. I think almost everybody would acknowledge that it's going to take some time to see what happens.\"</p><p>But McKenna's decision has codified what many believe could be a new prospect pipeline in hockey: players starting in the CHL and then moving to the NCAA right before they're drafted in the NHL -- or immediately afterward.</p><hr><p><strong>BUTTON BELIEVES THAT</strong> McKenna's path is the new pipeline. He played 16 games with Medicine Hat in 2022-23, followed by 61 games in 2023-24 -- scoring 97 points -- and then 56 games last season before packing up for Penn State.</p><p>\"Now you can go, 'What's best for my development at 15? Or 16? Or 17?' There's going to be a lot of players who play in the CHL because the level of play and the coaching is good. But now they don't have to forgo that opportunity to play in the NCAA,\" he said.</p><p>There are differences between the two paths. The CHL has players competing in significantly more games in preparation for an NHL-like grind. The NCAA plays fewer games, leaving players more time to develop and train between them. The CHL offers players a chance to compete against those around their own development curve, while the NCAA has 18-year-olds battling against 23-year-olds. The CHL is <a href=\"https://www.usahockey.com/news_article/show/1192379\">billet life</a>. The NCAA is college life.</p><p>Button is an optimist about the changing landscape. \"I really, really love the idea that more doors open and present options for the players to look at their development in a different way,\" he said.</p><p>He also doesn't see this as a serious blow to the CHL. He points to NHL stars like Kane and <a data-player-guid=\"2253f50a-7d0f-f0c4-7345-d3da9d3fdf65\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/4024854/matthew-tkachuk\">Matthew Tkachuk</a> that selected Canadian juniors over the NCAA. He notes that the current top prospects that do end up in the NCAA will likely do so after spending significant time in Canadian juniors. McKenna played 2½ seasons at Medicine Hat before making the leap to Penn State, leading the team to a conference championship and a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/45257130/top-nhl-prospects-2025-memorial-cup-gavin-mckenna-easton-cowan-cayden-lindstrom\">Memorial Cup appearance</a> last season.</p><p>\"I know the CHL doesn't want to lose 19-year-old kids to the NCAA, but they're also going to get players that they weren't going to get at 16 and 17,\" Button said.</p><p>But Near doesn't believe this is necessarily a new talent pipeline for NHL prospects.</p><p>\"I have no problem with people experimenting or trying things out. I have no problem with other leagues that might be envious of the success that we've had -- or wish to be declared as our equal -- trying to suggest that we should be a development league for the NCAA, which in turn would be a development league for the NHL,\" Near said.</p><p>\"But that's not what we are.\"</p><p>The WHL commissioner notes the CHL has the better track record for player development, one that stretches back 50 years. He points to the 2025 NHL draft, in which 21 of the first round's 32 picks came from Canadian junior hockey, while five picks were credited to U.S. college programs.</p><p>\"The idea of someone going to the NCAA before their draft year will be occasional,\" Near said. \"This isn't just about money. It's also about what environment is going to put a player in the best situation to further his hockey development.\"</p><p>He points to the billet environment. \"Having a mother figure and a father figure around you to support you, help you with meals and help teach you how to do laundry and be independent,\" he said.</p><p>He points to the CHL schedule and the number of games in which players will appear during a typical season, noting that the former junior players who get their professional start in the American Hockey League have said the CHL best prepared them for that grind.</p><p>Near isn't looking to have the WHL rest on its reputation. He has a survey out to players this offseason to hear about what works and what doesn't for them. \"We're not crossing our arms and saying we do it better. We're spending a lot of time assessing what we can do better, how we can enhance the player experience and environment,\" he said.</p><p>That includes thinking about CHL players that might find their way back to junior hockey after moving over to the NCAA. It's a trend several sources anticipated happening in the new paradigm.</p><p>Factors behind that reversal could range from a lack of ice time to the realization that they're not ready to face older competition to the fact that not every 18-year-old \"walking onto a college campus, jumping onto the first power play and making the most NIL money\" will be welcomed with open arms by older teammates with their own NHL aspirations, as one NHL source framed it.</p><p>\"NCAA hockey is hard for a lot of 18- and 19-year-olds,\" said Button, who sees the option to go back to juniors like a part of the transfer portal.</p><p>\"There's a transfer portal in the NCAA athletics right now. Maybe not as much ice time. Maybe there's a depth chart where I don't fit in. Maybe I'm not getting as much. So now you have the transfer portal in between schools, and there's going to be a transfer portal back to the CHL. That's going to be reality,\" he said.</p><p>Another potential wrinkle for Canadians coming to the NCAA: <a href=\"https://www.mccarter.com/insights/changing-immigration-policies-pose-new-challenges-for-ncaa-institutions-and-nil-opportunities-for-international-student-athletes/\">rapidly changing immigration policies</a> that could impact student visa statuses. It's a topic Big Ten schools like Oregon have <a href=\"https://generalcounsel.uoregon.edu/name-image-and-likeness-international-student-athletes\">openly discussed</a> since NIL started.</p><p>\"I'm not rooting for anything to go poorly, but we are setting up our operations so that if a player has regrets that we're going to welcome them back,\" Near said.</p><p>\"I think that there's a possibility some guys swing back to our league. I think people will maybe develop a greater appreciation for all the things we do to create a player development experience. I wish it would come faster, because it's a stressful time. But we're watching closely and we're acting where we think it makes sense.\"</p><p>While times are stressful for Canadian junior hockey, Button doesn't believe changes to the prospect pipeline are a net negative for the CHL.</p><p>\"You have some people saying that everything is going to hell in a handbasket. No, it isn't,\" he said. \"Doors are opening for the CHL teams with getting good younger players into their program. The NCAA is getting more talent from the players that have been drafted, who now see college hockey as an option. NHL teams have more options open to them with respect to being sure about who they're signing. I think that's great.\"</p><hr><p><strong>AS IF THE PROSPECT LANDSCAPE</strong> hadn't undergone enough change, the NHL and the NHLPA further shifted it themselves in their <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/45732725/nhl-nhlpa-cba-new-rules-salary-cap-trades-ebugs-84-games\">new collective bargaining agreement</a>, which begins in the 2026-27 season.</p><p>One major change concerns 19-year-old players that were drafted by NHL teams from Canadian juniors. The NHL-CHL transfer agreement dictates that they either have to make an NHL roster or be returned to their junior team. Currently, CHL players can't play in the American Hockey League until they turn 20 or complete four seasons in the CHL.</p><p>In the new CBA, the NHL will reopen its agreement with the CHL to seek to eliminate the mandatory return rule. \"NHL will seek to limit NHL Clubs to Loaning no more than one (1) 19-year-old player per year to the AHL without the requirement of first offering such player to his junior club,\" reads the new amendment.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly for the NHL draft, the new CBA states that players selected at age 18 will have their rights retained until \"the fourth June 1 after they were drafted.\" For 19-year-old draft picks, their rights will be retained \"until the third June 1 after they were drafted.\"</p><p>Button sees this as a significant new development window for teams and players that will impact juniors and the NCAA.</p><p>\"The team has your rights for four years. It used to be in the CHL that you had to sign the player two years after you drafted him,\" he said. \"In the past, you might have to make a signing decision. Now, if a 20-year-old player might not be ready, a team can send him to the NCAA to get another year under his belt while retaining his rights.\"</p><p>This practice could become one of the most significant developments in the post-NCAA eligibility world: that NHL teams could use the NCAA as a preparatory league for former Canadian junior players before bringing them to the pro level.</p><p>\"I think that because of that fact, you are going to get more high-profile players in college hockey,\" Gadowsky said. \"NHL teams are going to support going to college hockey because of that. There are a lot of great players that have had a lot of success in junior hockey and are looking for the next step, but that may not be ready to reach the NHL. I think college hockey is an attractive option for many NHL teams.\"</p><p>This trend is already happening. The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"1b1346bb-9cad-dd44-4de5-91724595e92b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/cgy/calgary-flames\">Calgary Flames</a> took center Cole Reschny from the WHL Victoria Royals at No. 18 in last month's draft. Reschny is headed to North Dakota next season. (His Royals teammate Keaton Verhoeff, a highly touted defenseman, will join him at NoDak as the rare 17-year-old NCAA player.) The <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4e807ac9-f3b7-8e3b-8549-441c1e604c17\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/nyr/new-york-rangers\">New York Rangers</a> drafted winger Malcolm Spence from the OHL Erie Otters at No. 43. He'll play at the University of Michigan next season.</p><p>\"The CHL and the USHL teams have resources. They spend a lot of time on development, but it's different at an NCAA school, especially a major power,\" Button said. \"It's going to be really interesting for the kids at 18 who aren't NHL-ready to go back to junior, and then at 19 you're like 'You're either in the NHL or you're back in junior.' Well, now there's the NCAA as the next step in terms of their development. You have to be a student-athlete and you have to commit to that. But I think the NHL benefits from this, too.\"</p><hr><p><strong>MCKENNA WILL LIKELY</strong> head straight to the NHL after next summer's draft, as almost every No. 1 pick has done for decades. He'll do so after facing older, larger players for a season before joining the NHL, like <a data-player-guid=\"39b94cbf-c622-3ef0-b459-b4730c1fdf84\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/5206628/macklin-celebrini\">Macklin Celebrini</a> did with Boston University and <a data-player-guid=\"dfef08c0-dde0-de14-4b8f-13ca40daef21\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/4024123/auston-matthews\">Auston Matthews</a> did with Zurich SC in the Swiss league.</p><p>\"The guys that have confidence and are ready for that next challenge, that's not going to scare them. They don't care about dropping in the draft. They care about getting better,\" Granato said. \"If they're going to get better by going to play against older and bigger and stronger players in a better league, they're going to do it. That's just their mentality.\"</p><p>McKenna would be just the fourth winger in the past 15 drafts to be selected first overall, after Nail Yakupov (<a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c78600f3-cea1-f6e0-11cf-dfeefe1897ff\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/edm/edmonton-oilers\">Edmonton Oilers</a>, 2012), <a data-player-guid=\"ed5104b2-2d35-3b72-ad49-b8e66ffc2b37\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/4697382/alexis-lafreniere\">Alexis Lafreniere</a> (New York Rangers, 2020) and <a data-player-guid=\"62acd4a6-f752-38dc-9f21-0b8dafdfd8bd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/4915349/juraj-slafkovsky\">Juraj Slafkovsky</a> (<a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4110452f-e35d-14fe-8fbb-cdb21e269149\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/mtl/montreal-canadiens\">Montreal Canadiens</a>, 2022). None of these players had the early buzz that McKenna has generated, which is usually reserved for a franchise-level center among offensive players, like <a data-player-guid=\"8e2e22e8-01b6-8acb-8a50-47f4941b52c6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3895074/connor-mcdavid\">Connor McDavid</a> or Matthews.</p><p>Button doesn't see McKenna on McDavid's level, and doesn't see him as the goal scorer that Matthews has become. On the recent NHL first overall pick scale, he would slot McKenna in between Celebrini (San Jose, 2024) and <a data-player-guid=\"81ddb57f-8400-39c1-b2d4-82079f1ae2c0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/5149125/connor-bedard\">Connor Bedard</a> (Chicago, 2023).</p><p>But Button said the NHL comparables for McKenna -- should he reach the potential of his trajectory -- are a pair of former Hart Trophy winners: Patrick Kane and Nikita Kucherov. Both players can score goals, as Kane is sixth (492) and Kucherov is 22nd (357) among active players. But it's their playmaking ability on the wing that reminds Button of McKenna, who was a Kane fan (and a Blackhawks fan) growing up in Whitehorse, Yukon.</p><p>\"The way he can control the game, take over games. I think we play similar styles. Smart hockey players that can slow down the game but speed it up when we want,\" McKenna said.</p><p>Gadowsky said McKenna's ability to slow things down and create at his pace is indicative of an elite player that thinks the game differently. Gadowsky grew up watching Wayne Gretzky. While he's not about to make a direct comparison between \"The Great One\" and \"The Nittany One,\" the way they both process hockey is something no one can teach them. It's inherent.</p><p>\"There's no way that I or anybody else on our staff thinks like Gavin does. He is a very, very special athlete,\" he said. \"By no means am I ever going to talk to him about how his mind creates. That's all him, and it's going to be really fun to watch.\"</p><p>That Penn State fans will be the ones watching him is still a bit surreal for Gadowsky, the only coach the program has known as part of the Big Ten. The Nittany Lions have been a slow-building success. Getting McKenna to commit is one giant leap forward for the program -- and for college hockey.</p><p>\"There's a ton of great Penn State supporters that are really, really excited to watch him play and see what he does in the future,\" Gadowsky said. \"I mean, they're going to love him. They're going to absolutely love him and we're thrilled that someone of his stature is going to be attached to Penn State.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

In our hotel room in Auburn, my teenage son, Austin, reassembles his road bike, broken down and carefully packed for the flight from Idaho.</p><p>After 14 years, the motleyest fondo in cycling is coming to an end. When we lived in Alabama, our family did Bo Jackson's charity ride every single year. Over the past seven years, we'd missed the spring ride and the community it created. Hearing this year was The Final Ride, my son and I planned a homecoming trip for the bittersweet victory lap.</p><p>Austin was 6 the first time he did Bo Bikes Bama. I towed him in a Burley bike trailer as he passed out Easter eggs. At 8 he was the youngest rider to pedal the 20-mile loop around Auburn, crushing the hills and becoming an unofficial mini-mascot. At 9, he raced a boy up the climbs, shook Bo's hand, and mailed him a hand-written thank you note:</p><p><i>I think it is great that an NFL <strike>player</strike> star like you takes the time and energy out of your day to do this. In a few years I might be able to catch up to you! ... Thank you for putting on Bo Bikes Bama. Your <strike>fre</strike> friend, Austin Freyer </i></p><p>Then we moved to Idaho. Seven years flew by. Austin elongated into a lean, taut 17-year-old cyclist on a national devo team, training 15 hours a week for mountain bike nationals. He'll finally be able to catch up to Bo. That is, if it doesn't storm.</p><p>\"One hundred percent chance of rain,\" a volunteer says. \"Like an inch. At least.\"</p><p>If lightning strikes, the ride will be cancelled. If not, we'll ride in the rain. In 14 years of Bo Bikes Bama, they've never once had bad weather. Maybe the lucky streak has run out for an outdoor event held at the peak of tornado season in the heart of Dixie Alley.</p><p>It is muggy but not yet raining, so we take our bikes on a spin around Auburn. Bo Jackson is ever present: on a '90s \"Bo Knows\" poster in a sneaker boutique; in a photo in the local bike shop; embodied as a bronze statue in front of Jordan-Hare Stadium.</p><p>I'm a University of Alabama grad, but I'm far from the only Crimson Tide fan with a soft spot for Auburn's most famous Heisman Trophy winner. If I had to pick one athlete for my son to look up to -- in any sport -- it would be Bo Jackson. Not for his ability to bulldoze a wall of linebackers, bat the stadium lights out, or snap a bat over his head like a twig. As superhuman as those feats may be, I admire the human side of Bo not everybody knows.</p><p>As we roll past Toomer's Corner, I check the forecast. Slight chance of severe weather. It would be a bummer to fly 2,000 miles only to get stormed out. But then, it would be a fitting end to a ride that exists because of a storm.</p><hr><p><b>APRIL 27, 2011</b> was the deadliest day of the biggest tornado outbreak on record. The three-day storm unleashed 349 tornadoes on 21 states, from Texas to New York. Of the 324 people killed, 252 died in Alabama, our former sweet home, and the state where Vincent Edward Jackson grew into the legend we know as Bo.</p><p>In Alabama, it's hard to find anyone who doesn't remember the day when 62 tornadoes raked the state. The awful winds peeled roads from the earth, crumpled steel buildings like wads of foil, and hurled an SUV like a matchbox car into a water tower. In a typical year, only one EF-5 -- the biggest tornado -- is recorded in the U.S. On this day, there were four.</p><p>Thirteen minutes is the average time between tornado warning and impact. When the sirens wailed over Birmingham, my husband grabbed a mattress and I buckled a bike helmet on our 4-year-old son. In our laundry room -- the smallest room, lowest floor, middle of the house, away from windows and doors -- we huddled around Austin.</p><p>The power flickered out. In the dark, we watched on our phones as the Tuscaloosa tornado blendered toward us, live on the Birmingham sky-cam. Meteorologist James Spann told our neighborhood to take cover. I thought: <i>What do you say to your child if it's the last thing he ever hears?  </i></p><p>That tornado stayed on the ground for 80 miles, inhaling homes and chicken coops and spitting them out like shrapnel. That single tornado -- one of six or seven on the ground at once -- killed 65 people and injured 1,500.</p><p>It missed us by 8 miles.</p><p>Elsewhere, people were crushed or beaten to death by shards of homes they trusted to protect them. The swiftly moving monster scoured mile-wide swaths of emptiness, scarring the land with tracks so big they could be seen from space.</p><p>From the ground, it looked like some supersized bush hog had mowed indiscriminate corridors through the Alabama pines. Small-town sidewalks glittered with broken glass, and churches collapsed into piles of brick.</p><p>Tornadoes are the Russian Roulette of natural disasters. In hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, the damage is more evenly distributed. Tornadoes are acutely erratic, wiping one home off the face of the earth, but leaving the house next door unscathed. Those of us spared are haunted. <i>Why them? Why not us? </i></p><p>This was life-altering. But outside of the South, many people have no memory of this storm. A few days later, Osama bin Laden was killed.  Weeks later, an EF-5 tornado wiped out Joplin, Missouri. The media moved on.</p><p>Bo Jackson had long ago moved with his wife and kids to Chicago. But he still has extended family in Alabama, and often comes back to visit. He wanted to help his home state.</p><p>That year, while watching the Super Bowl, he dreamed up an offbeat idea: a charity bike ride. He'd pedal across the state, leading a philanthropic peloton like Forrest Gump on a bike. Wherever he goes, the media follows, so he'd tow them through badly hit areas. Their cameras would draw attention -- and help -- to forgotten rural towns.</p><p>The route would begin in northeast Alabama, in the foothills of the Appalachians. Like a stage race, it would advance in segments, around 50 miles a day, through a devastated landscape. This five-day tour de tornado would launch before the one-year anniversary of the storm.</p><p>For serious road cyclists, 50 miles is a weekend ride. For non-cyclists, riding 50 flat miles is a pretty tall order. Pedaling 50 hilly miles -- for five days in a row -- is grander than a fondo. Some might call it a sufferfest.</p><p>This was back before e-bikes. Bo pedaled a custom carbon-fiber Trek Madone -- a different one each day of the ride -- to be auctioned off later to raise money for the Alabama Governor's Emergency Relief Fund. He invited celebrity athlete friends to join him. It was a Level 1 recovery ride for Lance Armstrong. But <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/2148/ken-griffey-jr\">Ken Griffey Jr.,</a> Picabo Street, Al Joyner, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/663/scottie-pippen\">Scottie Pippen</a> and actor André Holland huffed and puffed on the struggle bus with the rest of us mortals.</p><p>One of my favorite fellow mortals, Brittney Whorton, has ridden all 14 years of Bo Bikes Bama and raised more than $3,000. That first year, she rode through tears, thinking about her brother. On April 27, 2011, she'd been sitting at a baseball game in Auburn when her phone blew up with photos of Tuscaloosa. Her brother lived two blocks from Bryant-Denny Stadium and worked near McFarland Boulevard and 15th Street -- ground zero.</p><p>She called and called, but the lines were either down or overloaded. More than a day went by without knowing whether her brother was dead or alive. Finally, her phone lit up with a text: <i>I'm okay. It's bad. I don't have power. Hope this makes it out. </i></p><p>Brittney rode the final day of the first Bo Bikes Bama, rolling through forests of wind-warped trees, past homes that looked as if they'd been bombed. \"Less than a mile in, I just started crying,\" she remembers. \"You're met with people cheering with shakers, holding signs, clapping and yelling, 'Thank you!' I cried the entire day for one reason or another.\"</p><p>She and I were there when Bo stopped the group -- 200 riders or so -- at a place he called \"the blender,\" where a lonely set of porch steps led to nothing more than sky. She stared at a tangle of fallen trees and noticed two flashes of light: rearview mirrors of vehicles buried under the trees. She turned to Picabo Street, her childhood hero, and said something Picabo would later repeat in a speech at the end of the ride:</p><p>\"I wish that everybody could see this devastation in this manner. When you're going 50 miles an hour, it's easy to miss the little things. When you're going 15 miles an hour, everything looks different. It's so much more impactful.\"</p><p>The ride ended with a party in Tuscaloosa, the biggest Alabama town hit by the storm, torn asunder by the EF-4 tornado that missed the University of Alabama campus by less than a mile. Tuscaloosa is the home of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/333/alabama-crimson-tide\">Crimson Tide</a>, the bitterest rival of Jackson's alma mater. As I wrote in \"What Stands in a Storm,\" Bo's choice to end in T-town was a pretty magnanimous move:</p><p><i>Alabama is a state where college football is a few prayers shy of religion, where a family containing fans of both the Auburn Tigers and the Crimson Tide is a house divided. This is a place where \"Roll Tide!\" and \"War Eagle!\" can mean anything from \"Congratulations on the birth of your first child!\" to \"Fie upon thee, thou wretched miscreant! A curse upon your children's children!\" </i></p><p>In this stretch of the Bible belt, loving thy enemy as thyself is one thing. But loving the other side of the Iron Bowl is a job for Bo Jackson and Jesus.</p><hr><p><b>BO BIKES BAMA</b> starts with a Friday night reception and silent auction. It turns into a scrum of neck hugging, toasts and grip-and-grin photos with people who haven't seen each other since the previous Bo Bikes Bama. It's also the time to ask your favorite celebrity for a photo. Past superstars included <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13994/cam-newton\">Cam Newton</a>, Scottie Pippen, Brian Bosworth and an occasional actor like Ben McKenzie from \"Gotham\" and \"The O.C.\" This year's A-listers are <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/285/desmond-howard\">Desmond Howard,</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/2576434/melvin-gordon-iii\">Melvin Gordon</a> and Ken Griffey Jr.</p><p>Every year, Bo also makes a speech and a toast. As one who overcame a childhood stutter, he speaks slowly and deliberately. Always from the heart, no notes.</p><p>\"I never thought this would go on as long as it has,\" Bo says tonight. \"People around the planet know that we here in this state do things to help each other.\"</p><p>During the era of Bo Bikes Bama, more than 10,750 riders have collectively ridden 380,000 miles and raised nearly $3.5 million. The money has been used to rebuild homes and construct dozens of community tornado shelters in the state. But Bo also built something that money can't buy.</p><p>\"We built a real community around this ride,\" Bo likes to say. \"We've become a family.\"</p><p>Bo waves his longtime manager, Becky Daniel, onto the stage and drapes a muscular arm around her thin shoulders. \"She's like my second wife,\" he says. \"The only people who are allowed to call me out are my wife and Becky.\" He acknowledges her as one of \"the MVPs\" of Bo Bikes Bama, along with core team members Rebecca Falls, Julie Ward and Rylee Roquemore. All women -- no coincidence. It's a nod to being raised by a single mother who worked three jobs to bring up 10 kids in a three-bedroom house. These women have run this show in health and in sickness -- colon cancer, breast cancer and a double mastectomy -- showing up for Bo on days when they might have called in sick.</p><p>Longtime event-team members Todd VandeBerg and Adam Kostichka join the women in presenting Bo with a gift: an Auburn-colored Madone, displayed in a giant wood frame. It's the bike he rode the first day of the first ride, bearing the names of the 252 Alabamians who died.</p><p>On the bike he will ride this year, a line from the Bible is printed on the top tube, with a slight edit: <i>I am my brother's and sister's keeper. </i></p><p>\"I'm not ending the philanthropic things I do for this state,\" Bo tells the crowd. \"We're just going to move on and do something else.\"</p><p>A gust of wind and a few drops of rain signal the evening's close. Folks tip back their plastic cups and cans of Bo Bikes Bama Session IPA as Bo reminds us why we are here.</p><p>\"Let's try to put some sunshine in someone else's cloud.\"</p><hr><p><b>CRAWLING INTO BED</b>, I check the weather. A tornado has touched down in Texas, along with hail \"as big as baseballs.\" Instability, muggy air from the Gulf -- key ingredients of tornadoes -- are drifting into place.</p><p>\"Heads-up to anyone in the deep South to mid-Atlantic,\" a meteorologist warns. \"We do have a severe weather threat possible of producing large hail, tornadoes and damaging winds.\"</p><p>The next morning around 5 a.m., I pull open the curtain and stare into the steel-wool pre-dawn. It isn't raining -- yet -- but the clouds hang low and heavy.</p><p>At that moment, less than a mile away, at Neville Arena, ride director Rebecca Falls is frowning at her phone. Her radar app shows a line of red-and-yellow splotches marching west across Alabama. A squall line. Headed straight for Auburn.</p><p>The ride is scheduled to roll in two hours. Precisely when the nasty band of thunderstorms is due to crash the party, bringing lightning, rain, hail and 30 to 40 mph winds.</p><p>Rebecca, born and raised in Tuscaloosa, has seen what the sky can do. Not only when T-town was hit in 2011, but again just seven months ago, when a hurricane ravaged her neighborhood in Asheville, North Carolina.</p><p>On September 27, 2024, Category 2 Hurricane Helene barreled into North Carolina, obliterating thousands of trees, flooding homes, triggering mudslides and killing more than 100 people. A month after the storm, some roads were still undrivable. The hardwood forests looked like they'd been thrashed by a giant weed-whacker. Friends showed up at Rebecca's house with chainsaws and helped her clean up. Much was lost. But loss and love have a way of revealing what cannot be destroyed.</p><p>Now, as another storm approaches Auburn, she agonizes over the decision she has to make: Cancel the ride, and end an era on a sad note? Or send 1,300 riders out into the unpredictable weather?</p><p>Around 5:15 a.m., her phone rings. She holds her breath as a meteorologist from the National Weather Service delivers an updated forecast. Auburn will shortly be hammered by wind, rain and hail. But the storm should blow through by 7:30 a.m., and in its wake will be innocuous rain. If she delays the start by 45 minutes, the ride can go on.</p><p>At the original start time, a dark, wedge-shaped cloud knifes through the sky over Jordan-Hare Stadium. To some, it feels like an omen. To others, a poignant echo of why we are here. On this, the 14th anniversary of the storm, the sky forces us to remember.</p><p>Fifteen minutes before the new start, the winds die down and the rain begins. \"Sweet Home Alabama\" echoes through the parking lot, where hundreds of cyclists in Gore-Tex roll to the starting chute through puddles.</p><p>From the warm and cozy VIP suite, Ken Griffey Jr. walks outside, squints into the rain, and shakes his head.</p><p>\"No chance. Too cold. Past my bedtime.\"</p><hr><p><b>BO JACKSON WAS</b> 4 or 5 when he learned to ride a bike around his neighborhood streets in Bessemer, Alabama. The eighth of 10 siblings -- nine living under one roof at once -- he grew up in a three-bedroom house with no plumbing, sharing a bed or sleeping on the floor. Some mornings, he'd wake up with burns on his butt from bumping against the gas heater.</p><p>He and his buddies discovered a passion for stealing bikes. \"We called ourselves the Bike Bandits,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"Bo Knows Bo.\" \"I could steal a bike, take it home and, within an hour and a half, strip the bike, throw it in a fire, burn the paint off, spray-paint it a different color, and then ride it down the street, doing wheelies past the house I stole it from.\"</p><p>It wasn't until retirement that he started riding a road bike. After the 1991 hip injury that eventually ended his career, running was painful. To stay fit, he started cycling.</p><p>\"It's another way to keep my back and legs strong,\" he told me in 2013. \"It's a very social exercise.\"</p><p>He mostly rides in Illinois, on bike paths around Chicago. \"You can get on a bike path, get into the forest reserve, and probably cross a street three times,\" he says. \"You don't have to deal with traffic. We have dirt paths, too.\"</p><p>His first \"big\" ride was Bo Bikes Bama. That first day hurt the worst. A hill in Guntersville caught him by surprise. He knew that hill from a car, but it was bigger on a bike.</p><p>\"That first day, I got a cramp,\" he recalls. \"I made it to my room, showered, and when I got up it hit me, right above my knee. I was screaming like a little kid! Pickle juice was my savior. I drank that every morning and evening.\"</p><p>One of my favorite things about that first year was seeing some of the world's best athletes willing to ride out of their comfort zone. Here was Olympic gold medalist skier Picabo Street, red-faced and cussing her way up a hill some dudes had to walk. And Ken Griffey Jr., not too proud for a shuttle ride up a climb. And 1984 Olympic triple-jump gold medalist Al Joyner, smiling through the pain. On a bicycle, they were human.</p><p>And then there was Lance. At one rest stop, he quipped, \"Bo don't know hills.\"</p><p>Bo's reply: \"I could get him on a baseball and football field and say, 'Lance don't know Jack about anything!'\"</p><p>Like most people my age, I remember the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sz6xhPkGJ4\">\"Bo Knows\" commercials</a> of the 1990s, like the one where he rolls up on a road bike and says, \"Now, where's that Tour de France thing?\" Of all the sports Bo knows, I was curious why he chose cycling for his signature fund-raiser. He loves golf, and a charity golf tournament might have brought in more money with less work. Why not a celebrity baseball game -- Bo Bats Bama! Why, of all things, a bike ride?</p><p>\"Only a certain amount of people know how to golf,\" he told me. \"But everybody knows how to ride a bike.\"</p><p>Many riders show up on Walmart bikes, mountain bikes, cruisers. Folks who might pedal a bike once a year will ride in jorts and sneakers. People from all walks of life -- who likely would never cross paths -- rally together and form real friendships.</p><p>\"You can have kids from their early teens to senior citizens, and everyone is having fun,\" Bo says. \"It is not a race. It is what I call a celebration ride. Everybody that rides is a winner, in that they're riding for a good cause. And that is to make the rest of the world aware that there are towns in Alabama that still need help.\"</p><hr><p><b>THIS YEAR, THE</b> first 5 miles hurt the worst. The rain is sheeting down, slickening the roads, making it hard to see. At the start of the 60-mile route, the fastest riders jockey for position next to Bo. Austin and I pull ahead, not trusting the wheels of strangers.</p><p>The plan: Ride together for the first 12 miles, until the first rest stop. That's where Bo visits with fans, then gets shuttled back to lead out the more casual 20-mile ride. I'll join Bo, and Austin will continue solo on the 60-mile loop. We'll reconnect at the final aid station -- where both routes merge -- and finish together.</p><p>I had packed an extra rain jacket, but Austin had waved it away. He is now soaked to the bone and shivering. He needs a more combustible pace.</p><p>\"Mind if I go on ahead?\" he asks.</p><p>\"Of course,\" I say. \"Get warm and be safe. Don't wait for me.\"</p><p>Bo is somewhere behind me, surrounded by a group of MAMILS (Middle-Aged Men In Lycra). I don't want to lose him. I pull over to wait. He passes at a mellow pace, and I start pedaling again.</p><p>But as I try to catch up, he pulls away. I haven't been in race-shape for years, but by golly I'm a cyclist, and my strength-to-weight ratio should help me catch a running back twice my size. I set my legs on fire, only to watch his NFL silhouette vanish in a curtain of rain.</p><p>Humbled, I console my limping ego: Not everyone has the honor of being dropped by Bo Jackson.</p><p>We catch up at the rest station, where Bo and Desmond are immediately swarmed by fans. Watching the clock, Bo's handlers nod: time get in the shuttle. Bo climbs into the towel-covered front seat, but Desmond Howard is still chatting with fans. Bo shakes his head. \"He can gossip like a Golden Girl!\"</p><p>\"Hey Des!\" Bo yells. \"Desmond! Are you walking back or you riding on? We gonna leave your ass, man!\"</p><p>\"That was an adventure,\" Desmond says, climbing in the backseat beside me. \"That was a first for me. That was pretty cool.\"</p><p>\"What, riding in the rain?\" Bo says. \"It cools you off, man!\"</p><p>\"It was a nice experience -- it really was. Even when the bike in front of you is kicking up water in your face.\"</p><p>\"As long as it's not thunder and lightning,\" Bo says, \"I prefer to ride in the rain.\"</p><p>\"My wife goes, 'You must really love Bo. You ain't never rode in the rain!'\"</p><p>This is my favorite part of Bo Bikes Bama: hearing extraordinary people talk about ordinary things. Weather. Fishing. Cooking. Kids -- bragging and pretending to complain about them, just like the rest of us.</p><p>Bo has three grown children: two sons and a daughter named Morgan, who ran track and competed in gymnastics. She is engaged to the first suitor who (according to Morgan) her dad has ever liked. Bo calls him \"a nice young man\" and they golf together. But like every father in the history of brides, he is taking customary pleasure in griping about the wedding. Which will take place in (knowing look) November.</p><p>\"He's obviously not a football guy,\" Desmond says, sighing.</p><p>\"No,\" Bo says. \"He played basketball\"</p><p>\"So is the wedding going to be in Chicago?\"</p><p>\"I tried to get it at the house. They said, Nah, that's not going to work. So I'm going around the country, doing sports shows to pay for this damn wedding,\" Bo says. He spins around in the front seat. \"Hey, do y'all got work? I'll mow grass. I'll come and wash your car!\"</p><p>The shuttle erupts with laughter.</p><p>\"For this damn wedding and the honeymoon,\" Bo says. \"Bro, oh man, they'll use up all my Marriott points for the room in Maui. I'm like, all them points. Just like that -- gone.\"</p><p>So what does Bo do for fun?</p><p>\"Sit and sleep,\" he says. \"Rest of the time, I'm traveling all over the country. I fantasize about stuff I want to do to have fun. Like get my boat out and go fishing. I bought a motorized kayak during the middle of COVID. Do you know it's never been out on the water?\"</p><p>\"What would you fish for?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Everything. Anything! I just want to get it out, crank up the motor, and get out on the river or the lake and fish,\" he says. \"But I don't have the time.\"</p><p>\"If you could go fishing for anything, anywhere,\" I ask, \"where would you go?\"</p><p>\"I would go to the North Pole, fish with a reindeer horn and a jig with the Inuits.\"</p><hr><p><b>AT THE FINAL</b> rest stop, Austin finds me chatting with friends eating hot wings. I am thrilled that we'll get to finish the ride together, as we'd planned.</p><p>We rarely ride together anymore. He's always training, and I can't keep up. So the last few miles are a gift to me -- a memory with my son. We chat and keep our eyes peeled for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMLhQHVxqaj/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">The Hill</a> -- the one he had crushed as a little kid in the moment that made him, in the words of one volunteer, \"like a legend around here.\"</p><p>On a rough stretch of pavement in a tunnel of trees, I notice Bo riding in front of us. Alone.</p><p>\"Now's your chance!\" I tell Austin. \"Go ride with him!\"</p><p>Looking pro in his Donovan Racing kit, but with the shyness of a teenage boy, my son catches up to Bo Jackson. From behind, they look like a bull and a gecko.</p><p>\"Hey, Bo,\" Austin says, feeling awkward. \"I've been doing this ride since I was a little kid.\"</p><p>\"I remember you!\" Bo says. \"I remember you.\"</p><p>\"Thank you for putting on his ride,\" Austin says.</p><p>\"You're welcome,\" Bo says and smiles.</p><p>A few miles later, we spot The Hill. I mama-nag Austin to crush it.</p><p>\"Take off,\" I say. \"Meet me at the top!\"</p><p>In the final mile, a rider blasts by us. It's Desmond Howard, coming in hot.</p><p>\"Let's catch him!\" I tell Austin.</p><p>\"Hop on, mom,\" Austin says. I hop onto his wheel and tuck into his wind-shadow.</p><p>The rain has stopped, but the road is still wet, and I can taste the asphalt-flavored spray from his tires. My heart swells with a milestone moment: This is the first time I've ever drafted off my kid. Eleven years ago, I was towing him. Now he's pulling me.</p><p>We catch Desmond at the last turn before the finish line.</p><p>\"Hey Desmond!\" I say, and he looks up and smiles. \"This is the kid I was telling you about!\"</p><p>We ride bar to bar and Austin snaps a selfie of the three of us in front of the stadium. We cross the finish line together.</p><hr><p><b>IN THE VIP</b> suite after the race, I chat with Melvin Gordon. He's accustomed to grown men coming up to him and fangirling. But his friends are making fun of him, because he's only now realizing what a big deal Bo Jackson is.</p><p>\"I knew... I mean, it's Bo Jackson. But like, I didn't know. It took 'til today. I told him, 'I didn't didn't know you were like Jesus.' A lady literally told me that. She's like, 'Bo Jackson, he's like Jesus here!'\"</p><p>A waiter in Birmingham says more or less the same thing that night when I pick up takeout in our former hometown. \"I'm an Alabama fan,\" the waiter says. \"But I love Bo Jackson!\"</p><p>We're going to visit with old friends before we fly out in the morning. I've ordered food and put an open invitation on Facebook to come visit in our hotel lobby.</p><p>One of the friends I'm looking forward to seeing is Michelle Downs Whatley, one of the central characters in \"What Stands in a Storm.<i>\" </i>We haven't seen each other in a decade, though we've kept in touch, our lives forever bound by a storm and a story.</p><p>On April 27, 2011, Michelle was a senior at Mississippi State in Starkville. Her big sister, Danielle Downs, was preparing to graduate from the University of Alabama with a social work degree. They had recently tried on dresses for Michelle's wedding, just 10 days away. Danielle was the Maid of Honor.</p><p>As the atmosphere boiled with supercells, both college towns were under tornado watches and warnings. On Alabama's ABC 33/40, a massive black funnel was live on the skycam, targeting Tuscaloosa. The sisters texted feverishly:</p><p>5:02    Danielle          There's a f---ing huge tornado heading to downtown Tuscaloosa</p><p>5:04    Michelle          I'm at my place and clay is on campus. so far we are ok. are you safe?</p><p>5:06    Danielle          Good good   im at the house ... im just getting sick w/this tornado   its on the skycam on the news   and its heading to downtown and campus</p><p>5:08    Michelle          oh my gosh! Be careful!</p><p>5:09    Danielle          Its very big michelle   u know how I don't get scared w/these but this is huge...</p><p>In her house in Tuscaloosa, Danielle was huddling under the stairs with two college friends, Loryn Brown and Will Stevens. Loryn, a sports broadcasting student and the daughter of a UA football player, was sobbing into her phone: \"Mama, I'm scared!\" Will, a three-sport high school star on a baseball scholarship to Stillman College, was holding Loryn's hand.</p><p>At that moment, across town, two twentysomething storm chasers were driving toward the tornado, trying to catch it on film.</p><p>\"There it is! There it is!\" Nate Hughett yelled, zooming in with a shaky hand. \"You can see the debris in the air! That thing is massive!\"</p><p>The driver, Ryne Chandler, sped down the interstate, trying to get behind it. Then realized they were in its path.</p><p>\"We need to go faster!\" Nate screamed. \"It's coming right at us!\"</p><p>Ryne Chandler jammed the car in reverse and stomped on the gas. They sped backward down the interstate, filming the tornado -- a mile and a half wide -- as it tore through Tuscaloosa.</p><p>\"It's crossing the interstate right where we were!\"</p><p>Minutes later, Michelle stopped hearing back from Danielle. Days later, she would identify Danielle's body by her Joan of Arc necklace.</p><p>Now, 14 years later, here we are, brought together by a storm. Haunted by the memories, but not wanting the world to forget.</p><p>Nate Hughett strides up to me in the hotel lobby and introduces himself. We've never met in person. Michelle and I had spent hours together, crying the ugly cry as we worked to bring her sister to life on the page. We text every year on the anniversary of the storm and on Danielle's birthday.</p><p>Storm chaser on my left, survivor on my right, we sit down to share a meal.</p><p>I ask Nate how he felt, thinking back on that day.</p><p>\"Obviously, it was a tragic day,\" he says. \"But for me personally, it was one of the best days of my life.\"</p><p>I feel Michelle wince and turn away.</p><p>The last scene of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIx26tN6pCk\">storm-chasing video</a> -- which has 4.7 million views -- shows the chasers pulling up to a ravaged neighborhood minutes after impact. A woman stumbles out of the wreckage, screaming for help. That's when the chasers turned the camera off and started digging people out.</p><p>The driver, Ryne Chandler, spent the following weeks clearing roads with a chainsaw and thinking, <i>If this ever happens again, I'd love to know how to help. </i>Today, he's a professional firefighter and first responder in Tennessee.</p><p>Michelle and her husband went through with their wedding as planned, days after losing Danielle. They are doing well and raising two young girls. The oldest, 4-year-old Sydney Marie -- who shares a middle name with Danielle -- has started asking about her aunt. \"She's in heaven,\" is no longer enough to satisfy her curiosity.</p><p>\"She started asking the why and the how,\" Michelle says. \"I don't want her to be fearful. Cautious is one thing. But fearful of death...\"</p><p>The last time a storm came through, Sydney helped her mother pile blankets and pillows under the stairs. They put on bike helmets and waited there until it passed. Auntie Danielle did all of those things, but she and her friends still died. How do you explain that to a 4-year-old who thinks that life should be fair?</p><p>Not everything happens for a reason. But beautiful things come from our brokenness. The things that tear our world apart can reveal what holds us together.</p><hr><p><b>AFTER THE RIDE,</b> I ask Bo, \"How does it feel? Are you sad?\"</p><p>\"A little,\" he says. \"It hasn't hit me yet. It'll hit me next week.\"</p><p>My heart is already heavy. I can't shake the feeling that something essential is coming to an end.</p><p>In a state that's fiercely divided, in a time when the entire country seems at odds, Bo Bikes Bama brought people together across great divides.</p><p>In cycling, riding alone is the best way to fall behind. Power comes from the peloton, where riders -- competing on different teams -- work together toward a common goal. Individuals take turns \"doing the work\" up front, then peel off and rotate to the back, where they can rest in the pack's wind-shadow. Like migrating birds in an echelon, drafting conserves energy and maximizes efficiency. Working together, we go farther, faster.</p><p>This takes trust. An implicit promise: to move steadily and predictably, and warn the riders behind you about a coming pothole or rough patch of road. Breaking this promise can cause a crash, a massive pile-up. You have to look out for others.</p><p><i>I am my brother's keeper.</i></p><p>It's something Bo says a lot. The phrase is an allusion to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel, a nod to the moral duty we have to care for and protect each other. Appearing on posters and T-shirts since the beginning of Bo Bikes Bama, the phrase was later revised to include sisters.</p><p>This is the Bo not everyone knows.</p><p>In college, he would stop by the Auburn Child Development center to visit troubled kids. \"If I can get a child who's in pain -- physically or mentally -- to smile, if I can brighten his day, that's better than hitting a home run, better than scoring a touchdown,\" he wrote in 1990. \"That makes me feel like I've done something worthwhile.\"</p><p>A few days before the announcement of the Heisman Trophy, an 11-year-old boy with leukemia was asked to make a wish before a bone-marrow transplant. Between practice and media interviews, Bo made time to meet him, granting his wish.</p><p>Every Thanksgiving and Christmas, Bo drives to the local grocery store and loads a shopping cart with turkeys and hams. They're for his tailor, the security guards in his gated community, and other service workers who play some small role in his very big life.</p><p>\"He does that for everyone that we know,\" his daughter, Morgan, tells me. She and her mother, Linda, often come down from Chicago for Bo Bikes Bama. They work alongside all the other volunteers, carrying boxes, folding merch or cheering at an aid station.</p><p>\"It made me see my dad in a different way,\" Morgan says. She is usually spicy and funny as hell, but I hear her voice soften through the phone.</p><p>She knows the dad who was never too proud to play Barbies or have a tea party with his little girl. She sees the entrepreneur who runs so many businesses he doesn't have time to hunt and fish or golf as much as he wants. She feels the love of a family man who wraps his nephews in bear hugs and kisses his grown kids, no matter how old they get.</p><p>But it took Bo Bikes Bama to see him not as her dad, or an uber-athlete, or a celebrity.</p><p>\"He's just a beautiful soul,\" she tells me. \"He could be doing anything he wants right now, anything in the world, and he wants to rebuild his home state. He's a genuine human being who cares about where he comes from.\"</p><p>Morgan, now 34, will soon walk down the aisle on the arm of Bo Jackson, and her daddy will probably cry when he gives his baby girl away.</p><p>I ask her, \"What's the most important thing you learned from your father?\"</p><p>\"Take care of the people who take care of you.\"</p><hr><p><i i=\"\">Kim Cross is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of \"What Stands in a Storm\" and a lifelong athlete who has competed in 10 sports.

Meanwhile, Marvin Harrison Jr. was drafted before any of them but didn't even reach 900 yards. While Harrison was by no means a Fantasy football bust, this should help refine your 2025 Fantasy football strategy when it comes to drafting rookies. Travis Hunter was the first pass catcher taken in this year's NFL Draft but is by no means a lock to be the most productive Fantasy football 2025 pick amongst rookie receivers.</p><p>Fellow first-rounders Tetairoa McMillan and Matthew Golden could be their teams' top wideouts from day one, while Emeka Egbuka gets to start his NFL career with a Pro Bowl quarterback throwing him passes in Baker Mayfield. Rookies are often the hardest to make Fantasy football projections for, so what should one make of this year's class? Before setting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>Last year, the model accurately predicted that Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud might take a step back in his second season. He finished as QB18 and anybody who avoided drafting him early dodged a major headache in their Fantasy football lineups. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and calling Rachaad White's breakout in 2023. Additionally, it has called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.</p><p>The model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking. The 2025 Fantasy football PPR rankings and 2024 Fantasy football standard projections update multiple times daily, so you're always getting the best Fantasy football advice.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest 2025 Fantasy football rankings, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Raiders quarterback Geno Smith. The Raiders traded a third-round draft pick for Smith in March, signing him to a two-year contract extension. He will be playing in a new-look offense under offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, who has utilized an up-tempo pace throughout his coaching career.</p><p>Smith has some intriguing weapons in Las Vegas, including rising star tight end Brock Bowers and dependable veteran Jakobi Meyers. The Raiders also added rookie running back Ashton Jeanty in the draft to provide some balance. Smith was the QB13 in Fantasy scoring last year, and the model has him as a top-20 quarterback this season despite his ADP of 25.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football sleepers 2025 here</a>.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts</h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Giants wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson. The 24-year-old receiver enters his fourth NFL season, so although he's later in his career than your typical breakout, Robinson isn't much older than the incoming rookie class. Robinson played his entire rookie season at 21 years old, whereas many of the top rookie receivers are entering this season at 22. Robinson had more receptions (93) and targets (140) last year than in his first two seasons combined.</p><p>Robinson was a second-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft after having 104 receptions for 1,333 yards in 13 games as a junior at Kentucky. He was used more in New York as the season progressed, including 10 receptions in the final game of the season. With offensive head coach Brian Daboll remaining in place, that involvement could continue to rise. The model has Robinson in the range of more high-profile receivers like Rome Odunze, Chris Olave and Jayden Reed in its 2025 Fantasy football rankings as it projects Robinson to be a more reliable Fantasy football receiver this year.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football breakouts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2>Top 2025 Fantasy football busts</h2><p>As for players to avoid, the model lists Chargers running back Najee Harris as one of its 2025 Fantasy football busts. Since being drafted in 2021, Harris ranks first amongst running backs in games played (68) and second in carries (1,097). While his durability may carry over from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles, don't expect his volume to. Harris was clear-cut No. 1 RB for the Steelers, ahead of Jaylen Warren, but with L.A. taking Omarion Hampton in the first round, Harris will have to adjust to a complementary role out west.</p>\n        \n\n<p>With that, it's hard to envision Harris carving out a sizable role. He's never been a proficient goal line back, as he's never had more than eight rushing scores in a season, and he offers little in the passing game as he ranked 25th amongst RBs in catches in 2024. Harris finished 20th in positional Fantasy points in each of the last two seasons, but the model doesn't even have him in the top 25 RBs in its Fantasy football rankings 2025.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy football busts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2>How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football football rankings</h2><p>SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising wide receiver you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy football drafts. This wide receiver is listed as a shocking top-15 option ahead of stars like A.J. Brown and Tyreek Hill.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025 Fantasy Football sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which WR shocks the NFL with a top-15 performance? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/#ttag=05042025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_football_nfl_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get 2025 Fantasy Football cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that called C.J.

As the clock ticked towards full-time at the Stade de Genève, the Italy captain was granted a lap of honor as she walked the perimeter of the pitch to be substituted, soaking up the applause from her adoring public before being mobbed by her teammates and manager in the dugout.</p><p><strong>- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/44614054/women-euro-2025-fixtures-results-schedule-bracket\" target=\"_blank\">Women's Euro 2025 bracket, results and fixtures schedule</a><br>\n- Nottingham: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45067839/can-euro-2025-provide-italy-women-momentum-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Can Euro 2025 provide Italy with momentum of 2019?</a></strong></p><p>The mood in the Norway camp couldn't have been more different. At the final whistle, several players had their heads in their hands while captain <a data-player-guid=\"2f68f010-9bde-9225-1c76-e63ba7dc5842\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/188067/ada-hegerberg\">Ada Hegerberg</a> -- who had only minutes earlier looked poised to be the hero of the piece -- cut a forlorn figure as she stood alone in the center of the pitch.</p><p>For much of this tournament, Hegerberg has, perhaps unfairly, been held up as a symbol of Norway's problems. Despite winning all three of their group games at a Euros for the first time ever, Gemma Grainger's side have largely failed to capture the imagination this summer, struggling past hosts <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6d0fbee2-00e0-ed33-b5c7-32fd32a9418a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=17641\">Switzerland</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9e6c626c-407d-3cbb-bd4b-e100b7c1c33f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=7536\">Finland</a> before an entertaining 4-3 victory over <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4ab03e32-960c-459e-f9a1-b62c3901f0c4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=3683\">Iceland</a> sealed them top spot in Group A.</p><p>That Hegerberg was an unused substitute in last Thursday's thriller in Thun only seemed to add weight to the growing sense that Norway had, perhaps, evolved past the former Ballon d'Or winner. But manager Grainger refused to bow down to external calls to drop her captain for the clash with Italy and, sure enough, Hegerberg found herself at the center of the action.</p><blockquote data-partner=\"tweetdeck\"><div lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Cristiana Girelli vs Norway | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEURO2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WEURO2025</a></p><p>Girelli established herself as a cult hero in Italy with her brace today.

However, the 30-year-old bounced back in spectacular fashion just six minutes later, poking the ball past <a data-player-guid=\"aa9a0fe7-dd1f-a59e-5156-b640acedbac5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/259759/laura-giuliani\">Laura Giuliani</a> to draw Norway level and pumping her fist stirringly in the direction of the travelling supporters.</p><p>It looked like Hegerberg's strike would be enough to send the match to extra-time but Italy had other ideas. Once again, it was Girelli with the decisive moment, nodding home from another excellent Cantore cross in the 90th minute.</p><p>For Norway, it was a crushing blow and one that continues their trend of failing to deliver at major tournaments.</p><p>Despite being the second-most successful team in Women's European Championship history, they failed to make it out of their group in both 2017 and 2022. Though they went a step further this time, it is hard to fathom how a team packed with so much star quality -- Barcelona's <a data-player-guid=\"825604e9-249e-d19d-7210-7b0cef3ef3c4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/253699/caroline-graham-hansen\">Caroline Graham Hansen</a>, Chelsea's <a data-player-guid=\"c0c31479-81fc-9659-6c8b-fb82b80d405c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257483/guro-reiten\">Guro Reiten</a> and Arsenal's <a data-player-guid=\"60f8f89a-4689-a983-305a-3043fe546737\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/259331/frida-maanum\">Frida Maanum</a> were also in the starting XI on Wednesday night -- consistently looks less than the sum of its parts.</p><p>But while the inquest into what went wrong for Grainger's side will no doubt continue long into the summer, this was a night that belonged to Italy.</p><p>Only six years ago, when the <em>Azzure </em>reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup in France, their side was made up entirely of amateur players. Their success at the tournament prompted the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) to commit to making Serie A Femminile fully professional by 2022, however it has not been entirely plain sailing since then.</p><p>They were dumped out of both Euro 2022 and the 2023 World Cup in the group stage, prompting longtime manager Milena Bertolini to resign via an open letter which claimed the team were \"not put in the condition\" to succeed.</p><p>Fast forward to present day, though, and Italy look like a force on the rise. Only two players in this summer's 23-player squad play their domestic football outside of Italy, while the country's bid to host the 2029 edition of the tournament indicates a more deep-rooted commitment to the growth of the women's game on home soil.</p><p>The significance of this moment was exemplified by the fact Girelli arrived for her postmatch news conference in tears, her pride at her team's achievement palpable.</p><p>\"It's something magical but to be honest I felt something special since we came to Switzerland,\" she said. \"Reaching the semifinals and being among the four best teams in Europe is something special, something great, but it is a demonstration of how much this team has believed from the beginning.</p><p>\"We had very difficult years. We suffered a lot so tonight, being among the four best teams, is a great satisfaction. We are doing this for the glory but the meaning is much deeper.\"</p><p>Of course, only time will tell how acutely the legacy of this Euros is felt back at home. But, with a mouthwatering semifinal tie with either England or Sweden to come in Geneva next week, it would be foolish to bet against Italy delivering another magical moment or two before their tournament is through.</p>\n</div></div>"

The 23-year-old enjoyed two robust seasons at <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6bca5a12-0a2e-45ef-82b0-b10bcf9c6ce5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=148\">PSV Eindhoven</a>, scoring 24 goals with 15 assists in 68 appearances in all competitions. And he was stellar for the United States men's national team in the <a data-league-guid=\"64cf0d9a-e3a9-33b1-a6ad-64639a8bb51d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/CONCACAF.GOLD\">Gold Cup</a> and friendlies over the summer, with three goals and three assists in eight appearances. A record signing for the German club, he will be an important member of a rebuilt Leverkusen attack.</p><p>Tillman also will have a prime opportunity to keep his national team stock high for the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/fifa.world\">2026 World Cup</a>. He might be the front-runner to start in the central attacking midfield role in U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation, and a solid season for a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.champions\">Champions League</a> club and recent <a data-league-guid=\"30244926-00c4-3f69-8946-f8421c97ff71\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/GER.1\">Bundesliga</a> champion will only reinforce that.</p><p>We tend to see a lot of jostling for position in World Cup years. While the U.S. has plenty of stalwarts and, if healthy, likely 2026 starters -- including left back <a data-player-guid=\"97f92287-b26d-c59a-5d43-db2c63cb7603\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/222396/antonee-robinson\">Antonee Robinson</a>, right back <a data-player-guid=\"254b39a6-cfff-9b84-ef34-36ac07fc8f59\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/266291/sergino-dest\">Sergiño Dest</a>, midfielders <a data-player-guid=\"4d70b696-ec86-7ac2-2239-881e594c538f\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/222776/tyler-adams\">Tyler Adams</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"80f154c0-ef1f-6615-9238-d22a3d6cd0e1\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/256715/weston-mckennie\">Weston McKennie</a>, and winger <a data-player-guid=\"4e537717-24b3-a77d-8d12-9cde8792bed6\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/225607/christian-pulisic\">Christian Pulisic</a> (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45514458/usa-mauricio-pochettino-christian-pulisic-gold-cup\">recent drama aside</a>) -- there are plenty of spots on the 26-player roster for next summer. And we could see quite a few players seeking changes in scenery this season with one of those spots in mind.</p><p>Here are eight national team members who are gearing up for prime U.S. lineup or roster spots in 2026 and could -- or maybe <i>should</i> -- change clubs in the coming weeks or months. What would be their best moves, if any?</p><hr><h2><a data-player-guid=\"b78313ab-9fa1-2806-1aa4-7c6128e92806\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/266027/timothy-weah\">Timothy Weah</a></h2><p><strong>Current team: </strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"87fe4844-a7cf-c88e-2ebe-aeb57325e990\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=111\">Juventus</a></p><p>The 25-year-old Weah started all four games for the U.S. in the 2022 World Cup, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/j_PpPF2MU3I?si=oR2dMkkmngkUphLF\" target=\"_blank\">scoring the opening goal</a> in an eventual draw with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8185a878-0157-7fe7-9fa8-f1cb3812476b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=578\">Wales</a>, and he has made three appearances since Pochettino took over in September.</p><p>Weah finds himself in a tricky position at Juventus: He battled a hamstring injury for a good chunk of the 2024-25 campaign and was in and out of the lineup, spending time at multiple positions.</p><p>He's also a bit of a tweener: He is a very good scorer and ball progressor for a fullback, and he's a good presser and defender as a winger; but he isn't a natural in either spot. Over the past two seasons with Juve, he has recorded 3,716 minutes in all competitions (ninth on the team), with seven goals (sixth), six assists (seventh) and 38 blocked passes (fifth) defensively. He is solid just about everywhere, but he's spectacular nowhere.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0716/r1519954_1296x864_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>Since Igor Tudor took over as Juve manager on March 23, the right-footed Weah has started just three of 13 matches and made appearances mostly on the left side of the lineup in Tudor's 3-4-2-1 formation. Juve have shopped him around and agreed to a deal with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ad9ef79b-ca27-077e-8a6f-335e0d220b27\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=393\">Nottingham Forest</a>, but Weah <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45595760/sources-usmnt-weah-rejects-notttingam-forest-deal\" target=\"_blank\">turned down Forest's contract offer</a>. Now, he's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45709594/usmnt-timothy-weah-talks-marseille-transfer-sources\" target=\"_blank\">in talks</a> with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0946f01d-a5f4-2c8e-c61d-bc162eac3f3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=176\">Marseille</a>.</p><p>Marseille would be an intriguing fit. Manager Roberto De Zerbi bounced between a 3-4-2-1 and 4-2-3-1 formation last season, and Weah's flexibility could make him an important player. His best position would almost certainly be as a right midfielder or wing back in a setup with a three-man defense, but since Pochettino is primarily a 4-2-3-1 man, this would split the difference nicely.</p><p>If <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/110\">Inter Milan</a> were to send <a data-player-guid=\"c128b9df-efdb-0638-a282-5b66a7fde3e4\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/213248/denzel-dumfries\">Denzel Dumfries</a> to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a> or elsewhere, as rumored, Weah would be a nice replacement option, as his stats were extremely similar to Dumfries' this past season. But if that isn't on the table, Marseille would be a solid alternative.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/290230/giovanni-reyna\">Gio Reyna</a></h2><p><strong>Current team:</strong> <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6cdd01c7-3938-6f1d-0c24-c7cf7da68d2b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=124\">Borussia Dortmund</a></p><p>The single most encouraging thing you can say about Reyna at the moment is that he's still only 22. If we ignore everything we know about his overall career trajectory and focus on the raw stats -- 5,762 minutes, 19 goals and 14 assists with Borussia Dortmund before his 23rd birthday -- there's still plenty of promise here.</p><p>An endless string of injuries, however, has limited his playing time and seemingly sapped a lot of his athleticism. He has played only 1,218 club minutes over the past two calendar years with only nine starts, and he has filled holes everywhere from left attacking midfielder to right back. His brilliant 2020-21 season -- 2,699 minutes in all competitions as a 17- and 18-year-old, seven goals (fourth on the team), six assists (fifth), 103 one-on-ones (second), 63 fouls suffered (second) -- is pretty far in the rearview mirror.</p><p>More than anyone else in the U.S. player pool, Reyna simply needs a set role and playing time. It's hard to imagine that coming with Borussia Dortmund. If he would consider <a data-league-guid=\"d9d3698e-67b3-3ca5-9eb4-f23b8e19a464\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/USA.1\">MLS</a> an option, which I doubt, he potentially could find a nice spot as a central attacking midfielder -- my own read on his best role -- with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d902d6f8-8673-29e3-15d9-3ef4c12ce9d0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=17606\">New York City FC</a> (where 38-year old <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/70624/maxi-moralez\">Maxi Morález</a> is logging major minutes) or, perhaps, other 4-2-3-1 teams such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/6077/houston-dynamo-fc\">Houston</a> (where he could team with <a data-player-guid=\"1ba45b72-8edb-3bd7-a0db-460d6dc67f56\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/303512/jack-mcglynn\">Jack McGlynn</a>) or <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6811fd61-2620-59df-cd4d-840f79458edb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=4771\">Real Salt Lake</a> (with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/148356/diego-luna\">Diego Luna</a>). But the best fit could be in the Bundesliga, where Gerardo Seoane's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/268\">Borussia Monchengladbach</a> operates from a 4-2-3-1 and gives a lot of central attacking midfielder minutes to 32-year-old <a data-player-guid=\"db3b6199-ac53-fbcc-edbf-a682492dcbe5\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/168318/alassane-plea\">Alassane Pléa</a>, whose contract expires in 2026 and who could move this summer.</p><p>If Reyna is healthy, it wouldn't be hard to envision him pairing well with the industrious <a data-player-guid=\"d19fad6a-8d5a-397b-89ff-ee429b8d9981\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/307364/rocco-reitz\">Rocco Reitz</a> in midfield. Really, though, the best fit is any team that will play him a lot. Hopefully he finds one.</p><h2><a data-player-guid=\"2362bba7-e1c6-3585-8d4a-d78775ad6eaf\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/307527/yunus-musah\">Yunus Musah</a></h2><p><strong>Current team:</strong> <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"7ca4fb35-d78e-49f0-67fe-7fa95588e28d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=103\">AC Milan</a></p><p>One of the most important players during the USMNT's solid 2022 World Cup showing, Musah finds himself in a situation reasonably similar to that of Weah and Reyna: He's a man with skills and no defined position. Musah is a high-level dribbler and hard-working defender and like Weah, might be best tucked into the right midfield. But Musah has spent time in a lot of positions, including right winger. He isn't a right winger. His one-on-ones chart basically shows that he'll take on anyone, anywhere, and that he's a man without a set spot.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0716/r1519956_1296x864_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>Like Reyna, Musah is still only 22 years old, and he's really good at what he's good at -- namely dribbling and drawing contact. New Milan manager Max Allegri could find him useful at right wing back or -- thanks to <a data-player-guid=\"c43b4ae7-4834-34ed-e958-7360cb259c5a\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/261328/tijjani-reijnders\">Tijjani Reijnders</a>' departure -- in the second defensive midfield spot in a 3-5-2. If we're thinking about what might translate well to playing time in Pochettino's system, defensive midfielder experience would be useful.</p><p>Allegri has proved allergic to playing younger guys at times, and the thing I'll call the Transfer Industrial Complex has linked Musah to Forest and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"20179aab-ac9f-93cf-f139-404e49a3f3cb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=114\">Napoli</a> in recent weeks. We'll see. But staying in Milan might not be the worst thing in the world.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/148356/diego-luna\">Diego Luna</a></h2><p><strong>Current team:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/4771/real-salt-lake\">Real Salt Lake</a></p><p>Aside from maybe goalkeeper <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/252974/matthew-freese\">Matt Freese</a>, no player improved his national team stock more than Luna this summer. The 21-year-old has eight goals and four assists midway through the MLS season after going for eight and 10, respectively, last season, and he made the most of Christian Pulisic's national team absence. In six Gold Cup matches, Luna finished first on the U.S. team in goals (three) and tied for second in shots on goal (five) and assists (two). Until he seemingly ran out of gas a bit against <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/203/mexico\">Mexico</a>, he put in solid pressing work throughout the tournament, as well.</p><p>Summer tournament success almost always produces a run of transfer rumors, as it has for Luna. He has been linked to a few European teams. Who doesn't need a burly, hard-working and opportunistic attacker for your bench, at the very least? Most notably among them is LaLiga's <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"13bc5b3a-1d14-ecd2-2fa2-35b32dbcf7d1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=85\">Celta Vigo</a>. As with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/5289/patrick-agyemang\">Patrick Agyemang</a>, Luna clearly doesn't have to leave MLS to get on Pochettino's radar. But Celta Vigo would be intriguing: They were the fifth-best attacking team in the league last season, and they are rebuilding their attack after the loss of forward <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/252747/j%C3%B8rgen-strand-larsen\">Jørgen Strand Larsen</a> and winger <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/395625/fernando-lopez\">Fernando López</a> to Wolves. Celta Vigo just added a nice string-puller in <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8e6e95fc-4c18-1078-519c-b78f5fb1cf72\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=570\">Club Brugge</a>'s <a data-player-guid=\"45e5686f-8133-8629-9a4c-cda8556be448\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/279904/ferran-jutgla\">Ferran Jutglà</a> too.</p><p>That might be a good club to pursue. But even though Real Salt Lake kind of stink this season, Luna has a good thing going and doesn't need to leave just to get the national team manager's attention.</p><h2><a data-player-guid=\"1c139a14-b018-8fe0-47da-df2c47b6acd9\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/289120/ricardo-pepi\">Ricardo Pepi</a></h2><p><strong>Current team:</strong> PSV Eindhoven</p><p>You have to take a piecemeal approach to building a statistical profile for Pepi. Over the past two seasons, he has produced brilliant scoring stats on a dominant team in an attacker-friendly league. He played 1,486 minutes in all competitions over two campaigns with PSV but only started in eight of his 62 appearances. Attacker stats are typically friendlier when you're making shorter substitute appearances.</p><p>We've definitely learned that Pepi can contribute great things in a great environment, as 22 goals and six assists in 16.5 90s (aka the equivalent of 16.5 full matches) is outstanding work in any environment; and it has to be accepted that anywhere outside of PSV, his scoring stats will drop. But at different stops, he has proved different things. Meanwhile, at <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/3841/fc-augsburg\">FC Augsburg</a>, in an extreme too much, too soon move (he had just turned 18), he scored zero goals in 583 minutes but pressed like crazy and created 1.1 chances per 90 minutes.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45690919\" data-cerebro-id=\"686c57282882dd3629dd86fc\" data-title=\"Robson: The USMNT will struggle at the World Cup\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0707%2Fdm_250707_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Robson_The_USMNT_will_struggle_at_the_World_Cup_2025_7_8%2Fdm_250707_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Robson_The_USMNT_will_struggle_at_the_World_Cup_2025_7_8.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0707%2Fdm_250707_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Robson_The_USMNT_will_struggle_at_the_World_Cup_2025_7_8%2Fdm_250707_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Robson_The_USMNT_will_struggle_at_the_World_Cup_2025_7_8.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0707%2Fdm_250707_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Robson_The_USMNT_will_struggle_at_the_World_Cup_2025_7_8%2Fdm_250707_COM_SOC_ANALYSIS_Robson_The_USMNT_will_struggle_at_the_World_Cup_2025_7_8.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45690919\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:04</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Robson: The USMNT will struggle at the World Cup</p><p>Stewart Robson believes the USMNT might struggle at next year's World Cup after their poor performance in the Gold Cup final.</p></div></div><p>The rumor mill has linked Pepi with a <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"14acbd22-f709-1525-c5ab-1cb3ec8d1696\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=370\">Fulham</a> move, among others. But with Malik Tillman leaving PSV, <a data-player-guid=\"0ae48c19-9ae4-9d66-2869-24dd18912e49\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/127420/luuk-de-jong\">Luuk de Jong</a> out of contract and Pepi coming back from meniscus surgery, the best play for Pepi might be to work his way back to full strength in this forward-friendly environment. He could have a bigger role on a Champions League team, and if he has a good season, he'll enter free agency while playing a role on a World Cup team. There are worse situations than that.</p><h2><a data-player-guid=\"a687a21b-e5f5-016d-9c65-49e89a4dda18\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/5289/patrick-agyemang\">Patrick Agyemang</a></h2><p><strong>Current team:</strong> <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"03474104-6fe8-33cf-b1b2-c8d609c9b08b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=21300\">Charlotte FC</a></p><p>This one's tricky. As with Musah, the 24-year-old Agyemang is really good at what he's good at. He can use his 6-foot-4 frame to stress the hell out of center backs with his mere presence and draw a good amount of contact. He has scored 21 goals for Charlotte FC over the past two calendar years.</p><p>He also is a type of player the U.S. has had a lot of in recent years: an attacker who doesn't actually touch the ball. He has averaged only 30.2 touches per 90 minutes with Charlotte in 2025, and against Mexico in the Gold Cup final, he was almost completely isolated, managing just 24 touches and one shot attempt. In 626 minutes with the U.S. this summer, he averaged only about three shot attempts per 90 minutes. It's great to have a forward who can stress defenders and theoretically open up space for his wingers. It's even better to have a forward who shoots and scores.</p><p>It appears Agyemang is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45598529/usa-patrick-agyemang-charlotte-fc-derby-county-transfer\" target=\"_blank\">close to a move</a> to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/374/derby-county\">Derby County</a> in the English Championship. They were a direct, low-possession, counterattacking (and nearly relegated) side last year and should be again under new manager John Eustace. Many of the shots Agyemang created for himself this summer were from direct attacks, so you can see how he might be attractive. But he already had carved out a spot in the national team rotation, and Pochettino clearly was intrigued by him, so a move to a lower-level English second-division team brings some risk (and, I'm assuming, more money).</p><h2><a data-player-guid=\"d4fb5636-0f6a-e323-c9c3-f9ccc59139ef\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/263705/gianluca-busio\">Gianluca Busio</a></h2><p><strong>Current team:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/17530\">Venezia</a></p><p>Busio has a lot of miles on his 23-year-old legs. He broke through with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8ff544cd-355a-136d-d0fa-aabb58af1650\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=186\">Sporting Kansas City</a> at age 16, and between Sporting and Venezia, he already has recorded more than 12,000 minutes of action. Playing defensive midfield for Venezia in <a data-league-guid=\"9c1e0753-2757-3b78-a6ed-1b595caf8191\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ITA.1\">Serie A</a> this past season, he contributed to just about every line in the stat sheet: He was second on the team in fouls suffered; third in touches, progressive carries, progressive passes, chances created and ball recoveries; fourth in goals and pass attempts; and fifth in defensive interventions. He is proving durable and physical despite a 5-foot-7, 143-pound frame.</p><p>All in all, Busio has the Tor-Kristian Karlsen <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45359717/which-relegated-players-transfer-delap-dibling-busio-more\" target=\"_blank\">seal of approval</a>.</p><p>Venezia were relegated again in 2024-25, however, and now that he has proved himself at the Serie A level, a move is expected. Rumors link him to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"91856bfb-c5b4-82d1-cb9e-81e68e8aad4e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=118\">Udinese</a>, and that's probably about right: He might not be ready for a top-level team yet, but he could be a strong role player for a midtable club. The U.S. is loaded with interesting options at defensive midfield, where Tyler Adams, new <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/1068/atletico-madrid\">Atlético Madrid</a> addition <a data-player-guid=\"be7b4010-2fe0-84a0-1239-cb62418ccdc9\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/290802/johnny-cardoso\">Johnny Cardoso</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"539b3343-df3a-e111-6050-4eba24fc90b7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=167\">Lyon</a>'s <a data-player-guid=\"624404ac-7173-3884-89f9-2c34f5c3c406\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/303308/tanner-tessmann\">Tanner Tessmann</a> all lurk (and where Musah might get more club minutes). But as long as Busio stays on a top-division squad, he'll remain a solid option.</p><h2><a data-player-guid=\"d2d66832-1067-8fe4-fe87-48174bc5a263\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/248276/alex-freeman\">Alex Freeman</a></h2><p><strong>Current team:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/12011/orlando-city-sc\">Orlando City</a></p><p>As far as prospects go, Freeman might be the most fascinating in the U.S. player pool. The 6-foot-2 son of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45532026/usa-alex-freeman-secret-love-soccer\" target=\"_blank\">former NFL wide receiver Antonio Freeman</a> has enjoyed a breakout year at age 20. He debuted as an Orlando City starter and looked good enough to not only get a USMNT summer call-up, but also start every Gold Cup match at right back. He has contributed quite a bit to the Orlando attack with four goals and two assists from 31 chances created. But while he didn't do a lot of that with the national team, he still had a ton of touches and defensive interventions (third in both categories).</p><p>Granted, he also played the scorer onside for Mexico's winning goal in the Gold Cup final, and he was easily beaten in attack on a promising late scoring chance. His rawness is obvious. But he's absolutely tantalizing, as evidenced by his current <a href=\"https://fbref.com/en/players/754f150b/Alex-Freeman\" target=\"_blank\">scouting report chart</a> at FBref.</p><p>The rumor mill hasn't yet blown his name around as much as Agyemang's or Luna's. There was talk of a <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2b16729f-66de-7ff6-e30e-aefbea7c82df\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=115\">Parma</a> offer and things of that nature, but Freeman moving on after less than one full season as a professional starter might seem like a bit too much, too soon. Still, he came from out of nowhere and quickly advanced up the U.S. depth chart. He almost certainly is going to be at the center of many rumors this time next year.</p>\n</div></div>"

Nothing too bad,” Pogacar tells Matt Stephens after his crash yesterday. “My whole left arm is open, burned off skin. And I hit my hip a little bit and my shoulder, but luckily I was back on the bike quite fast. Today is another day. It’s not the first time I crashed and continued the race. It’s more important the legs than my arm. I have a super-strong team around me. I am so grateful I can rely on them, even if I have a hard day today, but I hope not. “It’s really sad to lose another young talent,” Pogacar says of Samuele Privitera’s death at the Giro della Valle d’Aosta yesterday. “It’s devastating. It’s one of the most dangerous sports in the world. Sometimes the risks we are taking are too far. I’m really sad for all his family. May he rest in peace … he deserves to “not be bothered” now.

You can see from both sides why a deal has not been struck yet. McLaurin is understandably <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commanders-terry-mclaurin-disappointed-and-frustrated-with-contract-situation-as-training-camp-nears/\">frustrated with contract talks</a> after a career year during which he racked up 82 catches for 1,096 receiving yards and 13 touchdown catches. The Commanders may not want to pay their top receiver $30-plus million per year considering he turns 30 years old on Sept. 15.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's explore both sides.&nbsp;</p><h2>Buyer beware of the age-30 wall</h2><p>The Commanders are ahead of schedule after <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> exploded onto the scene last year, leading Washington to the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1991. There's a ton of incentive to keep McLaurin happy as they wouldn't want to do anything to impede the development of the franchise's prized possession.&nbsp;</p><p>But it will come at a steep price, making him one of the 10 highest-paid wide receivers in the league at $30-plus million per year.

Age 30 used to be a massive red flag for running backs, but recently the evidence is piling up against wide receivers, too.</p><p>McLaurin only has 6,379 career receiving yards (he debuted at age 24 and has only played six seasons), but for the sake of looking at what happens to \"elite\" receivers as they age, I zeroed in on every player with 10,000 career receiving yards who has debuted this century.</p><p>There's 24 players that fit those parameters. There's a clear dropoff from that group when they hit age 30 as their receiving yards per game start to plummet. Only two players from that group averaged more receiving yards in their 30s than 20s:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1725130/travis-kelce/\">Travis Kelce</a> and Reggie Wayne.

You can't blame him for wanting to maximize his value as he approaches age 30. In some ways, McLaurin's year was actually prolific.&nbsp;</p><p>He was a threat from anywhere on the field last year. He was one of four players with catches on balls traveling each of the following distances through the air last season: behind the line of scrimmage, 0 to 9 air yards, 10 to 19 air yards, 20 to 29 air yards, 30 to 39 air yards, 40 to 49 air yards and 50-plus air yards. The other three were <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965664/alec-pierce/\">Alec Pierce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967762/jayden-reed/\">Jayden Reed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3132164/brian-thomas-jr/\">Brian Thomas Jr</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He caught 70% of his targets, which is a ridiculous number considering he was a downfield threat that was targeted on average over 13 yards from the line of scrimmage. The further a player gets targeted down the field, the fewer passes they should be catching. This wasn't the case with McLaurin. &nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>I looked at over 1,200 player seasons since 2010 (represented by the tiny dots in the chart below) and McLaurin was the second player to hit the following marks in a season: catch over 70% of his targets while being targeted 13-plus yards downfield. The other was Brandon Aiyuk. He was equally as surehanded as explosive in 2023, and was involved in last offseason's biggest contract dispute. Aiyuk eventually got a four-year deal worth $120 million total, so $30 million annually.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img alt=\"mclaurin-scatter.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/17/774417df-06a1-4b99-b38b-0fd68b3cac45/resize/670x377/6f21bf0d020e4d1698a0be1eea1bb601/mclaurin-scatter.png\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"377\" width=\"670\"></p></figure><p>In some ways, McLaurin raises the same questions people were asking about Aiyuk last year. Is he a No. 1 wide receiver? How much does he deserve to get paid? Now amplify that with McLaurin, as he's turning 30 in two months.&nbsp;</p><p>McLaurin is one of eight players since 2010 with a catch rate of 70% on 1,000 receiving yards and at least 13 touchdown catches. It's a pretty impressive list.&nbsp;</p><h3>70% catch rate, 1,000+ rec yards, 13+ rec TD (last 15 season<strong>s)</strong></h3><table data-title=\"8x2 Table\"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>2024</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Terry McLaurin</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2024</p></td><td><p>Ja'Marr Chase</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2021</p></td><td><p>Cooper Kupp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>Davante Adams</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2015</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1244486/doug-baldwin/\">Doug Baldwin</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014</p></td><td><p>Antonio Brown</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1244303/rob-gronkowski/\">Rob Gronkowski</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011&nbsp;</p></td><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/417623/jordy-nelson/\">Jordy Nelson</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>McLaurin set a franchise-record with 13 receiving touchdowns last year and caught almost half of Daniels' touchdowns. He even hauled in an absurd 12 of 14 red zone targets for 10 touchdowns. We haven't seen a wideout with that high of a touchdown rate in the red zone since 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>He's been remarkably consistent in his career as one of six players with 900-plus receiving yards in each of his first six seasons, despite catching touchdowns from <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2174914/taylor-heinicke/\">Taylor Heinicke</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1137118/case-keenum/\">Case Keenum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123797/sam-howell/\">Sam Howell</a>, Dwayne Haskins, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/552642/alex-smith/\">Alex Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1907522/carson-wentz/\">Carson Wentz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131782/kyle-allen/\">Kyle Allen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1880862/marcus-mariota/\">Marcus Mariota</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1877247/jacoby-brissett/\">Jacoby Brissett</a> and now Daniels.&nbsp;</p><p>He's a franchise treasure, tied for the most 1,000-yard receiving seasons in Commanders history (five), along with Gary Clark and Art Monk.</p><h2>Father Time is still undefeated</h2><p>Both sides have plenty to bring to the negotiating table. For me, I'd hold my ground if I'm the Commanders. There's been way more Pro Bowl-caliber wide receivers hitting a wall around 30 recently (Cooper Kupp, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1737078/deandre-hopkins/\">DeAndre Hopkins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1984220/amari-cooper/\">Amari Cooper</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1737096/keenan-allen/\">Keenan Allen</a>, Stefon Diggs all struggled or were hurt last year) than there were those that thrived (Mike Evans and Davante Adams, maybe).</p><h3>Former Pro Bowl receivers at age 30 or older last season</h3><table data-title=\"11x2 Table\"><tbody><tr><th><br></th><th>Rec Yards</th></tr><tr><td><p>Davante Adams</p></td><td><p>1,063</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mike Evans</p></td><td><p>1,004</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tyreek Hill</p></td><td><p>959</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Keenan Allen</p></td><td><p>744</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cooper Kupp</p></td><td><p>710</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Adam Thielen</p></td><td><p>615</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DeAndre Hopkins</p></td><td><p>610</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tyler Lockett</p></td><td><p>600</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Amari Cooper</p></td><td><p>547</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stefon Diggs</p></td><td><p>496</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Father Time is undefeated and has decided to strike elite wideouts at age 30.

But there are obviously comparable players in similar situations. And, if the people want comparisons, comparisons they shall have!</p><p>The process here was simple: I jotted down each of 2024's top breakout players and came up with a short list of players who fit a similar profile as they enter 2025. Below is analysis of each player who best fits the bill, as well as the other players who landed on the short list.</p><p>Note that this is not my way of definitively predicting that these players will break out this season. Again, it's simply the players positioned to do so as a product of landing in a situation similar to those who exploded onto the fantasy scene last season.</p><h3>This season's <a data-player-guid=\"f03f3238-b035-6f0e-5844-1529ca021c3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426348/jayden-daniels\">Jayden Daniels</a>/<a data-player-guid=\"f9de7512-a950-3317-816b-abe094068409\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426338/bo-nix\">Bo Nix</a>: <a data-player-guid=\"9f4e87b5-5da8-38c0-9951-e3496b55b3c8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4688380/cameron-ward\">Cameron Ward</a></h3><p><em>Daniels and Nix were fantasy starters as rookies.</em></p><p>Daniels and Nix didn't enter their rookie season with especially notable supporting casts, but that didn't stop either from using a combination of terrific passing and rushing production en route to a top-10 fantasy campaign.</p><p>Similarly, Ward -- the No. 1 pick in April's draft -- doesn't have an especially impressive group around him. He'll need to be the rising tide that lifts all boats (very possible considering he tossed a class-high 39 TDs and posted a 88.7 QBR at Miami last season) while also contributing with his legs. Ward certainly won't be confused for an elite scrambler such as Daniels, but he averaged a ridiculous 9.1 yards per carry last season and could rival Nix's 430 rushing yards as a rookie. If Ward proves the real deal, QB1 fantasy production is within the range of outcomes.</p><p><strong>Other candidates: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"13e97d3e-2171-371b-9a7a-2c44670b5a62\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4689114/jaxson-dart\">Jaxson Dart</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"db08b6f5-a66c-3022-8e51-e509258adaed\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432734/jalen-milroe\">Jalen Milroe</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"0eb2837a-e6ed-bbd7-d7d5-cbeb2cd7ab11\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360689/tyler-shough\">Tyler Shough</a></p><hr><h3>This season's <a data-player-guid=\"5bb4376a-d089-e3e4-e49a-44f1d709a012\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield</a>: <a data-player-guid=\"975cc6da-01e5-3dcc-8a1a-1c9ecdb27d58\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685720/bryce-young\">Bryce Young</a></h3><p><em>Mayfield, the No. 1 pick in 2018, was nearing the bust label before finally breaking out with his first QB1 season.</em></p><p>Mayfield was nowhere close to the fantasy radar during his first six NFL seasons (18th or lower in points per game in all six), but he exploded to a fourth-place finish in 2024. Young is much younger (entering his third season), so while this might be a bit premature, we did see some signs of a potential breakout late in 2024. After struggling badly as a rookie and being benched early last season, Young averaged 18.0 fantasy points from Week 8 on, which would've ranked 10th over the full season. One reason for the leap forward was a big boost in rushing (208 yards and five TDs in his final eight games), which was also something we saw from Mayfield last season (career high 378 yards and three TDs). With an upgraded supporting cast and Mayfield's old coach (Dave Canales), Young is well positioned to make a big jump.</p><p><strong>Other candidates:</strong> <a data-player-guid=\"bfee0387-e51a-3429-baa1-8f8f84c37769\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429084/anthony-richardson-sr\">Anthony Richardson Sr</a>.</p><hr><h3>This season's <a data-player-guid=\"938f19a1-ef9b-618c-2365-d55291e0fcc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\">Sam Darnold</a>: <a data-player-guid=\"460fbf74-c64d-3862-b942-852d104e94dd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4433970/jj-mccarthy\">J.J.

Both have the skill set to deliver as a rusher and receiver, so fringe RB1 production is certainly a possibility for both.</p><p><strong>Other candidates: </strong><a data-player-guid=\"69abf2e0-5e51-3367-a4cf-2eaf9d46ff9b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4819231/kaleb-johnson\">Kaleb Johnson</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"d5a1025a-0474-3cc4-90d2-99ebf41df879\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685702/quinshon-judkins\">Quinshon Judkins</a> (<a data-player-guid=\"fb81ea34-8566-3bda-9997-f9bf0a4ba991\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4890973/ashton-jeanty\">Ashton Jeanty</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"757d9056-88c7-3df1-b2e3-f6f8f186780b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685382/omarion-hampton\">Omarion Hampton</a> are obvious breakout candidates at RB, but they're going much higher in drafts).</p><hr><h3>This season's <a data-player-guid=\"299f83a3-54ea-c2bc-743a-e84fe4e1de18\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360516/tyrone-tracy-jr\">Tyrone Tracy Jr</a>.: <a data-player-guid=\"7c6344a7-ae7c-372e-8337-ed04ccb56cc0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4882093/bhayshul-tuten\">Bhayshul Tuten</a></h3><p><em>Tracy was a Day 3 rookie who, after a slow start, took his team's lead back role and emerged as a fantasy starter.</em></p><p>Tracy was a fifth-round flier in last year's draft and, after he played a minimal role behind veteran <a data-player-guid=\"6e8f4728-f347-ab07-9112-a1528d0162d7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040761/devin-singletary\">Devin Singletary</a> early on, he claimed lead back duties in Week 5 and never looked back.

While the 30-year-old running back did suffer a right knee injury in Week 16 (which he attempted to play through the following week), he proved to be a consistent producer for fantasy managers. That doesn't mean Benson, Conner's backup, won't have utility in 2025, though. A power runner with 97th percentile speed, Benson was the second back selected in last year's NFL draft. Coach Jonathan Gannon has already intimated that Benson would likely have a larger role in his second campaign, which makes sense given Conner's injury history and Benson's skill set. With the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/45112208/2025-nfl-schedule-fantasy-football-projections-stats-win-totals-odds\">fourth-easiest strength of schedule among RBs</a> (according to Mike Clay) and currently being selected 158th overall in ESPN fantasy drafts, Benson is one of the highest-upside backups at the position. <i>- Loza</i></p><p><b><a data-player-guid=\"2fbd2f9e-624d-3e63-9bb5-9bb965782b68\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431452/drake-maye\">Drake Maye</a>, QB, </b><strong><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0078f353-fe3e-67ed-a42c-43cca0568e21\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots</a></strong></p><p>Maye didn't have the best rookie season from a raw numbers perspective, but if you look a little deeper, you can see why there's reason for optimism heading into Year 2. Not only did he deliver six games of at least 17 fantasy points, he finished sixth among QBs in rushing yards per game. Those wheels should be on full display again in 2025, but this time he might not need to use them as much. <a data-player-guid=\"d6ba7023-458c-f59a-4af2-638770067518\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976212/stefon-diggs\">Stefon Diggs</a> joins the receiving corps as veteran presence, and there's excitement around rookie third-round WR <a data-player-guid=\"359ec99e-3714-88dc-c5de-1dc522b8369f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4613202/kyle-williams\">Kyle Williams</a> as well. Maye certainly needs to clean up his mistakes after finishing his rookie season with 16 turnovers against 17 total touchdowns, but he has the potential for low-end QB1 upside in 2025 thanks to his rushing floor and new-look offense. <i>- Dopp</i></p><p><b><a data-player-guid=\"87c807fb-79fe-e421-02d2-6536bbe0618f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428209/ricky-pearsall\">Ricky Pearsall</a>, WR, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"985a261f-296c-c95c-32a5-addc4df75001\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">San Francisco 49ers</a></b></p><p>Pearsall is WR46 in 2025 drafts, but he scored 17 points or more in three of his seven games played as a rookie. Plus, in Weeks 17 and 18, he had 14 receptions and averaged 23.8 fantasy points. A detailed route runner who can provide a vertical push in one-on-one matchups, Pearsall will also get opportunities in Kyle Shanahan's system on in-breaking concepts off play-action, which lead to big plays.

He finished 2024 as the WR30 but ranked third in end zone targets (18), ninth in air yards (1,518) and 20th in total targets (116). A poor 59.3% catchable target rate limited his upside. With improved QB play from <a data-player-guid=\"9bef707d-d33f-266b-3020-81900d735915\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray\">Kyler Murray</a> and a clear WR1 role, Harrison has top-15 fantasy potential in 2025. <i>- Moody</i></p><p><b><a data-player-guid=\"774cc71b-e83e-340d-bcda-4a8558265bb5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431299/rome-odunze\">Rome Odunze</a>, WR, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"19d73366-b5a5-cca2-a176-a2c024ce0bb3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Chicago Bears</a></b></p><p>Odunze averaged only 8.5 PPG as a rookie, as he finished with 54 receptions (on 100 targets) for 734 yards and three scores. If you look closer at the tape, though, Odunze started to develop more nuance to his route tree over the second half of the season. He has the physical tools and vertical ability, plus he is now working with an upgraded Bears offense and playcaller in Ben Johnson. I expect quarterback <a data-player-guid=\"dd15176c-3004-333f-beaa-149216c42968\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431611/caleb-williams\">Caleb Williams</a> to play at a higher level and with a greater sense of calm under Johnson, and that will open the door for Odunze to produce breakout numbers. <i>- Bowen</i></p><hr><h2>Under the microscope</h2><p><b><a data-player-guid=\"bc4ba7ee-446b-36fd-9985-7fd2a94a98bc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432665/brock-bowers\">Brock Bowers</a>, TE, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b18540eb-6f2b-534c-e7f9-9bd930518da9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-raiders\">Las Vegas Raiders</a></b></p><p>Repeating a historical season isn't easy, and that's exactly what Bowers is trying to do. Only two tight ends in <i>NFL history</i> have topped 112 catches in a season, a number Bowers hit last season as a rookie. In addition, only six tight ends have seen the outrageous volume of 150-plus targets in a season. It's not that I don't have Bowers ranked as the TE1 heading into the season. I do. But things are very different in Las Vegas this season. While he does have a much better QB in <a data-player-guid=\"593e3c58-2b92-e0f1-f4a8-84215e27f023\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a>, he also adds a high-volume teammate in rookie RB <a data-player-guid=\"fb81ea34-8566-3bda-9997-f9bf0a4ba991\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4890973/ashton-jeanty\">Ashton Jeanty</a>, who should be the focal point of this new Pete Carroll offense. Jeanty is projected to have more than 340 touches, which could certainly impact Bowers' stat line. He can be hit by regression in 2025 and still be the TE1. <i>- Dopp</i></p><p><strong><a data-player-guid=\"dd15176c-3004-333f-beaa-149216c42968\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431611/caleb-williams\">Caleb Williams</a>.

Williams flashed at various points as a rookie, finishing inside the top eight fantasy producers at the position on five separate occasions. Inconsistent play (and playcalling), however, resulted in a largely underwhelming season, during which Williams was held to single-digit fantasy totals in seven games. Heading into Year 2 with a completely revamped offensive line, the addition of two highly touted rookie pass catchers (<a data-player-guid=\"678445c0-543b-31f1-b924-67545f33ebbb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4723086/colston-loveland\">Colston Loveland</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"f78ad5c7-c991-3940-b213-79f9a8d77008\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685278/luther-burden\">Luther Burden III</a>) and Ben Johnson's creative genius, Williams' situation has markedly improved.

Minutes later, he felt the joy of career renewal when his first-round knockout of <a data-player-guid=\"ec0593e7-f33c-6359-5873-a3c170c79a4b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3026133/diego-ferreira\">Diego Ferreira</a> put Poirier back in the win column just months after he'd suffered a momentum-halting defeat at the hands of <a data-player-guid=\"d715f512-b3a9-74f0-a760-d66701cfb199\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3022677/conor-mcgregor\">Conor McGregor</a>. Pocketing a $50,000 bonus for performance of the night felt pretty sweet, too.</p><p>But Poirier derived his most palpable jubilation that night from what UFC matchmaker Joe Silva said to him immediately after the fight. As they shared a congratulatory handshake in the cage, Silva reminded Poirier, who is from Lafayette, Louisiana, that the UFC had a fight card scheduled two months later in New Orleans.</p><p>\"[Silva] said he'll save me a spot if I wanted it,\" Poirier told reporters afterward, a smile spread across his face. \"New Orleans, I'm coming home, baby!\"</p><p>That June, Poirier made the two-hour drive from his hometown to the Big Easy, carrying with him the hopes and dreams of Bayou Country. The UFC's first New Orleans event in four years originally was to be headlined by fellow Lafayette native <a data-player-guid=\"dadec59d-f00f-62bd-06ef-75e1abfa689f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2509290/daniel-cormier\">Daniel Cormier</a>, but he was moved to a light heavyweight title fight on a different night. Lafayette welterweight <a data-player-guid=\"a2f9c8a5-a9b0-5caf-f704-1a2a94494665\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3045738/alan-jouban\">Alan Jouban</a> also was scheduled for the card, but he pulled out with an injury. That left one local hero for the crowd to make noise for at the Smoothie King Center.</p><p>It should be no surprise that Poirier's walkout blew the roof off the house. Colorful fleur-de-lis flags of Acadiana, honoring his home region's Cajun heritage, waved in the stands as he made his way toward the Octagon. Poirier passed many familiar faces in the crowd, later saying, \"I knew I'd have them on my side. They're bayou people. That's the way we are.\"</p><p>Poirier somehow managed to rein in his emotions during the walk, making it an energetic precursor to the fight itself. Poirier wasted no time rewarding his jazzed-up fans, sending <a data-player-guid=\"da200c85-aaee-faf6-bd18-ee06c77cafa6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2504257/yancy-medeiros\">Yancy Medeiros</a> to the canvas twice on the way to a knockout win in 2 minutes, 38 seconds. It was over almost before the welcome-home cheers had died down.</p><p>\"I'm driving straight home to Lafayette, not too far from here,\" Poirier said when asked during the postfight news conference how he would celebrate. \"We're boiling some crawfish.\"</p><p>If that short night's work left Poirier wishing for more time in the down-home spotlight, he's about to get it. For the first time in a decade, the UFC will be back in New Orleans on Saturday for UFC 318 (10 p.m. ET on ESPN+ PPV; prelims at 6 p.m. ET on ESPN2 and ESPN+). Poirier is headlining in a trilogy fight with <a data-player-guid=\"7e45261b-2ad6-dd5a-d2b8-c1056ad16e5f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2614933/max-holloway\">Max Holloway</a>.</p><p>This home game will be even more special for Poirier than the last one, because there won't be a next one.</p><hr><p><strong>POIRIER HAS BEEN</strong> talking about retirement for years. He also has been pushing for a return to New Orleans. Finally, it all came together in April, and Poirier gleefully went public with the news while he was in Green Bay, Wisconsin, for the NFL draft. Poirier sat on the set of \"The Pat McAfee Show\" in a black New Orleans Saints hoodie, talking about how honored he felt to announce one of the Saints' draft picks that night. And speaking of announcements ...</p><p>\"We're coming back to New Orleans. The UFC is coming back to New Orleans in July,\" Poirier said. \"July 19 is going to be my final fight. I'm going to lay the gloves down in Louisiana, where it all started for me. The whole journey started there.\"</p><p>That points to a reason this home game is even more meaningful than the one a decade ago: Poirier is even more deeply Lafayette now. He has always celebrated his roots, but back in 2015 he was spending much of his time in South Florida, where he trained with American Top Team. But when he and his wife, Jolie, became parents the following year, they moved back to Louisiana so their daughter would be around extended family.</p><p>\"Fighting, you have to be selfish,\" Poirier told ESPN back then. \"But I didn't want to take that away from her childhood.\"</p><p>At the same time, the Poiriers became increasingly involved in serving their community. They auctioned off several of his fight kits to raise money for local causes, which led to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/23132980/ufc-dustin-poirier-using-newfound-fame-improve-lives-hometown\">the creation of the Good Fight Foundation</a>, a nonprofit that provides meals, school supplies and support to underserved communities in south Louisiana.</p><p>His fight career might be at its end point, but Poirier is just getting started.</p><p>It is both puzzling and perfect that Holloway is Poirier's final opponent. Some may wonder why Poirier, who owns two victories over Holloway, would give him a third shot. Might the appeal be that this matchup offers Poirier an opportunity to walk off into the Lake Pontchartrain sunset with Holloway's symbolic BMF title belt slung over his shoulder? Or maybe it's simply that Holloway, a former featherweight champion who has landed the most significant strikes in UFC history (3,457), qualified for Poirier's short list of swan song requirements?</p><p>\"I said, 'legends only,'\" Poirier told McAfee in April, reflecting on what he told UFC matchmakers as they were looking to book his finale.</p><p>Poirier also appreciates the full-circle nature of the dance with Holloway. \"I was his first fight in the UFC back in 2012,\" Poirier said, \"and he's going to be my last fight in the UFC.\"</p><p>Such symmetry is as rare in MMA as a successful career ending. The closing chapter's plotline is still to be determined, but considering that the final act will take place in Poirier's backyard -- and considering that that backyard is located in the heart of Louisiana's festive culture -- there surely will be a celebration no matter who gets his hand raised this weekend. And since Poirier won't have to cut weight ever again, maybe this time his crawfish boil can include andouille sausage and finish with pecan pralines.</p><hr><p><strong>HOMETOWN FIGHTS DON'T</strong> happen every day or everywhere. The opportunities arise more fluidly for fighters who hail from popular UFC destinations. Las Vegas has been the site of more than 250 fight cards in the promotion's 32-year history, far more than anywhere else. The New York City metropolitan area, which reaches across the Hudson River to include Newark, New Jersey, has seen nearly two dozen cards. London has had 16, Rio de Janeiro 12.</p><p>Rio was the setting for unquestionably the most iconic image in the history of hometown fights. It happened in January 2012 at UFC 142, where the headliner was a champion in his third UFC bout -- but the first in his adopted home city. <a data-player-guid=\"af6462c5-8001-91aa-7e87-8d50e5251ba5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2447641/jose-aldo\">José Aldo</a> was in the midst of a decade-long winning streak that eventually would reach 18 fights, establishing him as a legend of the sport. When his knee to the chin of <a data-player-guid=\"424abdf2-be46-5659-1f07-56d6743e094a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2504172/chad-mendes\">Chad Mendes</a> knocked out the featherweight challenger with one second left in Round 1, the crowd noise at HSBC Arena was deafening.</p><p>Feeling the moment, Aldo raced out of the cage to be with his people. He jumped over the cageside seats and headed straight into the euphoric, bouncing crowd, with UFC security in hot pursuit. The fans engulfed the champ, lifting him on their shoulders and chanting his name. It was a chaotic, breathtaking scene of unbridled joy.</p><p>\"I think this was a way of giving back the affection they showed me,\" Aldo said backstage through a Portuguese interpreter. \"That positive energy was so good, so I tried to give them a victory and run to the crowd. I think there's nothing better than being with them.\"</p><p>Aldo didn't get the nickname \"The King of Rio\" for nothing.</p><p>Some of the most memorable hometown moments come when the UFC visits a city not on its usual road-trip route, because that can mean the card has been built around a local hero the company is backing. Perhaps the best -- and loudest -- example was in 2014, when the Octagon traveled to Dublin for just the second time. An Irish prospect in his third UFC fight was the headliner at a raucous 3Arena, and afterward the sport was never the same.</p><p>McGregor said he was going to finish <a data-player-guid=\"8fc24e2f-78f5-aca6-50c8-1d51c5175298\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2556056/diego-brandao\">Diego Brandao</a> in the first round, and he did, much to the delight of a legion of tricolor flag-waving supporters. Within a year, McGregor would be interim featherweight champ and the biggest star in the UFC, but on this night early in his Octagon career, McGregor's self-belief was already off the charts. And he linked that to his hometown spotlight.</p><p>\"There's not a man alive that can come on this soil and beat me,\" McGregor said in the cage, drawing yet another roar.</p><p>Hometown fights always generate ramped-up energy with star-making potential, even when the local fighter is not the headliner. Of the UFC's 11 current champions, six have fought in or near their home bases, though most of those fights happened before their title reigns and mostly on undercards.</p><p>There have been a couple of notable recent exceptions. Last month, <a data-player-guid=\"05bc6f17-ca50-6e23-a424-39d4efdc6187\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3948572/merab-dvalishvili\">Merab Dvalishvili</a> defended his bantamweight title against Sean O'Malley in the main event of UFC 316 in Newark, a short distance from where the champion trains on Long Island, New York. And a year ago, UFC 301 headliner <a data-player-guid=\"a6844ce1-f0cf-9105-d80f-c42cf722889c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2560746/alexandre-pantoja\">Alexandre Pantoja</a> retained his flyweight belt by beating <a data-player-guid=\"6410fe20-c69c-3b9c-859a-d586e4da4f7d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4997217/steve-erceg\">Steve Erceg</a> in his hometown of Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>But while fighting at home can be a dream scenario, some fighters experience it as a nightmare. The fight week routine can be thrown off. Distractions pile upon distractions. Everyone from distant family members to long-lost high school classmates comes out of the woodwork seeking free tickets. And on fight night, everyone in the arena is focusing on you, you, you.</p><p>One vocal detractor of fighting local is heavyweight <a data-player-guid=\"f639ae5d-304a-3340-5264-33d222a2b80b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2560713/derrick-lewis\">Derrick Lewis</a>, who has had four UFC fights at home in Houston. He won the first two but lost the others, with one of those defeats coming in a 2021 fight with <a data-player-guid=\"b2bfb778-01a5-a5f9-b95b-364ed305b363\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4426000/ciryl-gane\">Ciryl Gane</a> for the interim championship.</p><p>\"I don't even want to experience that ever again,\" Lewis said on \"The MMA Hour\" shortly after the Gane fight. \"It was too much pressure. Too much, to the point where I really was calling people up to let me get some weed off of them so I can relax my nerves during fight day.\"</p><p>That sentiment might perplex fans accustomed to watching MMA warriors such as Lewis, the UFC's all-time leader in knockouts, bravely step into a cage again and again to do battle. But just as different athletes have different skill sets, they also vary in their emotional makeup. For some, there's an overload of unease performing in front of a massive collection of friends and family within the shadow of their houses.</p><p>\"It makes or breaks guys,\" Duke Roufus, head coach at the Milwaukee gym Roufusport, told ESPN. \"I have some guys on my team that live for fighting here in town, and some guys who say they'll never fight at home again. They feel too much pressure. But I believe in fighting at home, and I try to get my guys to focus on all of the advantages. Like, it's so much easier to sleep in your own bed.\"</p><p>If one of his fighters needs an extra emotional push, Roufus suggests looking at the situation from the opponent's perspective.</p><p>\"It's intimidating fighting in someone else's hometown,\" Roufus said. \"So I tell my guys, 'It's better when you're fighting in front of <i>your</i> people.' It brings something out of you.\"</p><p>Roufus knows from experience. He has been on the \"away team\" more than once in the UFC. He traveled with <a data-player-guid=\"7cce3dce-9a01-d388-5980-7a051e118282\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3894823/jared-gordon\">Jared Gordon</a> in 2019 to fight <a data-player-guid=\"8989cfe6-e393-a834-a54b-9de5d5a26e44\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2504169/charles-oliveira\">Charles Oliveira</a> in Sao Paulo, Oliveira's hometown, then accompanied <a data-player-guid=\"d66b5e39-9210-09c6-2535-b1cda1e924c2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3099985/paul-felder\">Paul Felder</a> to take on <a data-player-guid=\"08fd167d-4a0e-7044-a89f-da7beee2f39c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3109135/dan-hooker\">Dan Hooker</a> in Auckland, New Zealand.</p><p>Before turning to coaching, he was a multiple-time world champion in kickboxing and also competed in boxing. Between the two sports, he fought 11 times in Milwaukee. He won all 11. \"My dad used to sit in the front row at my fights,\" Roufus said. \"He got me started in the sport. I wasn't losing in front of him. That was my attitude.\"</p><p>That's also the attitude of Roufusport's star fighter, former UFC lightweight champion <a data-player-guid=\"bada3f81-49b9-3672-5f20-4c4e27980e92\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2504171/anthony-pettis\">Anthony Pettis</a>. He won the title in 2013 by submitting <a data-player-guid=\"ced83999-c67b-96a9-608f-343d0255ceff\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2487019/benson-henderson\">Benson Henderson</a> in the main event of UFC 164 in Milwaukee, the city where he was born and raised. Before Pettis' moment in the spotlight, he got to watch the prelim fights of two Roufusport teammates, <a data-player-guid=\"904db98a-452f-a9a6-39a0-9c405d987450\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2504556/erik-koch\">Erik Koch</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"0b6b6d51-0558-1b59-09bf-dc23555713c5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2523679/chico-camus\">Chico Camus</a> -- on TV in his living room at home. Pettis lived just a 10-minute drive from the Bradley Center.</p><p>\"When it was time for Anthony to be at the arena,\" Roufus recalled, \"he walked into the place cooler than an ice cube. He was ready to go.\"</p><p>Pressure? What pressure?</p><p>\"The way I look at it,\" Roufus said, \"pressure is what makes diamonds.\"</p><p>Perhaps that adage will bode well for this weekend's main event homeboy, Dustin Poirier. His nickname, after all, is \"The Diamond.\"</p>\n</div></div>"

There's just a thing in sports sometimes where one guy has another's number, and I think that's the case here. Dustin is just a more impactful striker. Max is great, but I don't think he has enough power to consistently stand with these lightweights. <i>-- Anthony Smith</i></p><p><img br=\"\" height=\"75px\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0604/espn_din-thomas_.jpg\">It's a home game for Dustin, and I think he has the ability to counterpunch Max. That's what gave Holloway problems in his last fight with Poirier, and I'm not sure Holloway has picked up on that and made the necessary adjustments. It's going to be a close fight, though. Competitive fight. I just think Dustin wins more rounds. <i>-- Din Thomas</i></p><h3>Betting analysis</h3><p><i>Odds accurate as of Thursday.

With two fighters of this caliber who have some of the best durability in the sport, it would be shocking if this fight wasn't competitive from bell to bell. The biggest question could be how Holloway responds to the first knockout loss of his career, the last time out against <a data-player-guid=\"7c7452e8-f7d0-bfa0-f6dd-61d531ad856e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4350812/ilia-topuria\">Ilia Topuria</a>. Poirier doesn't carry the same power. He is more the type to wear you down and finish you late in the fight, so the over 4.5 rounds feels like the play here. If you want better odds, take the fight to go the distance.</p><hr><h2>Parker's best bets on the rest of the UFC card</h2><h3>Middleweight: <a data-player-guid=\"d1996f3e-6feb-6558-f478-a08a6d15917c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4080826/paulo-costa\">Paulo Costa</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"0180f755-bea6-22fd-2788-2ce490a578da\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4300149/roman-kopylov\">Roman Kopylov</a></h3><p><b>Kopylov to win (-240).</b> Costa had a lot of success earlier in his career knocking out opponents and imposing his will with his athleticism, but it's been a while since he has had a dominant win over anyone of significance. Enter Kopylov. He is the betting favorite, and I am shocked the number isn't higher. Kopylov is the better striker and has worked hard of late to improve his takedown defense. Unless Costa turns into Anthony \"Fluffy\" Hernandez and becomes an incredible wrestler with unlimited cardio, look for Kopylov to put on a striking clinic and get the win here. If you don't like the -240 odds, take Kopylov to win by decision.</p><h3>Featherweight: <a data-player-guid=\"bf4de332-335e-ecee-ffe5-434ed46c08c8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4074001/dan-ige\">Dan Ige</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"460c1cfb-7979-8514-c911-1e27684cb836\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2532870/patricio-pitbull\">Patricio Pitbull</a></h3><p><b>Ige to win (-220).</b> Coming off a knockout win, Ige will be looking to add Pitbull to his résumé and continue to climb the ranks of the featherweight division. Ige has an endless gas tank, fight-ending power and a high fight IQ, which should pay off well for him against a seasoned MMA veteran. Pitbull didn't look like himself in his UFC debut, a decision loss to <a data-player-guid=\"0d4827a7-7803-bbe1-c14b-3761c5b97a1f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3155420/yair-rodriguez\">Yair Rodriguez</a> in April, but he was one of Bellator MMA's best fighters for a long time. Expect a competitive fight here. Both guys tend to start slowly, but Ige's volume and pace will increase as the fight goes on and get him the win. Ige opened as a -175 favorite and has climbed to -220. If those odds continue to rise, take Ige to win and the over 1.5 rounds.</p><h3>Middleweight: <a data-player-guid=\"43948b20-f9b7-6baf-532e-044bc82a5d80\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4001851/marvin-vettori\">Marvin Vettori</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"9f596ce0-1f13-bd7e-d4a6-2581007fb8fc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4025699/brendan-allen\">Brendan Allen</a></h3><p><b>Allen to win (-210).</b> Allen and Vettori have had run-ins outside the cage in the past, and now they will get to settle their differences in the Octagon. Allen is a -210 favorite, and I agree with the oddsmakers. As good as Vettori, a nine-year UFC veteran, once was, he has become a low-volume striker with no takedown attempts. But he still holds onto his durability. Allen has all the skills to be a champion but tends to fall short right before a title is in sight. He is getting Vettori at the right time in his career, and I expect Allen to be the better fighter everywhere and anywhere the fight goes. When Allen is aggressive, he is at his best. Expect him to show out in his home state of Louisiana.</p><h2>Parker's best bets for PFL Cape Town</h2><h3>Middleweight: Johnny Eblen vs. Costello van Steenis</h3><p><b>Eblen to win; over 2.5. rounds.</b> In the main event, Eblen will look to defend his middleweight championship against lethal striker Van Steenis. Look for Eblen, a heavy favorite, to get this fight to the ground early and keep a menacing pace to tire out Van Steenis and lessen his striking power as the fight goes on. Either put Eblen as the anchor to your parlay or take him to win and the over 2.5 rounds. He should win rounds and take this fight into deep waters.</p><h3>Women's flyweight: Dakota Ditcheva vs. Sumiko Inaba</h3><p><b>Ditcheva to win by TKO/KO.</b> Inaba will be looking to derail the hype train of Ditcheva, but I just don't see that happening. Ditcheva has world-class striking and fight-ending power that continues to get better each time she hits the PFL SmartCage. The only way to bet this fight is to take Ditcheva by TKO/KO. For the best odds possible, take her to finish it in Round 1.</p><h3>Heavyweight: <a data-player-guid=\"01b14461-921d-ae47-db54-f9abc3c10bf7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3112020/corey-anderson\">Corey Anderson</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"61b7a1da-402e-30aa-4efb-43e39cb0ccc7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3024604/denis-goltsov\">Denis Goltsov</a></h3><p><b>Anderson to win.</b> In a fight that can dictate who competes for the PFL heavyweight title later in the year, former Bellator light heavyweight champion Anderson takes on last season's PFL heavyweight champion Goltsov. The outcome of this fight is going to depend on whether Anderson can outwrestle his opponent early and survive Round 1. On the feet, I would lean toward Goltsov, but the wrestling and cardio departments belong to Anderson. I am going to take a flier on the underdog, Anderson, because Goltsov has a questionable gas tank and was too easily taken down by <a data-player-guid=\"0727ff36-b376-10da-3cfe-c1e084506cc8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4336342/oleg-popov\">Oleg Popov</a> in his last fight.</p>\n</div></div>"

Watt also offered his condolences on social media.</p>\n<p>Braman and Watt were teammates for three years in Houston starting in 2011 when they were both rookies. Although Watt was a first-round pick, Braman entered the NFL as a long shot to make the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a>&nbsp;roster when he signed as an undrafted free agent out of West Texas A&amp;M.

Braman recorded one special teams tackle in the win.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Braman didn't see as much playing time as some of his other teammates, he definitely made an impact on them.

Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, which means Palace are currently wearing a Tin Pot parachute against their will.</p><p>Their Bigger Vase place is likely to be taken by Nottingham Forest, whose benevolent concern for the greater good of football motivated them to inform Uefa of a potential breach of regulations by Palace. Forest’s owner Evangelos Marinakis also owns Olympiakos, but that’s different because … look, just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/crystal-palace-treatment-libs-dems-culture-secretary-lisa-nandy-fans-protest-uefa-headquarters\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">click this for all the grown-up stuff</a>. When Football Daily stumbled upon a video interview with Palace’s chairman Steve Parish and saw the quote “one of the great injustices”, our first thought was to wonder why Alan Bates had changed his appearance so drastically. Parish has appealed to Cas – and The Rest is Football, and anyone else who fancies an interview – so this is likely to go on for a while yet.</p><p>For a neutral teatime email there’s particular sadness in seeing Palace finish last in the Uefa Multi-Club Loophole Stakes. When they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final in May, one word was conspicuous by its absence from the immediate post-match analysis: Europe. All that mattered was that Palace had won their first major trophy at the tender age of 119, and gloriously to boot. A Bigger Vase spot was the reward, not the prize. We have sympathy, not least because a Uefa sermon on integrity is almost as hilarious as Bob Mortimer on Would I Lie To You? But this has been on the cards for one club or another since multi-club ownership became English football’s latest money-spinne – sorry, English football’s first opportunity to pioneer and deliver a consistent underlying approach to talent development, fan experiences, sports entertainment, commercial opportunities and community impact. Still, Palace v Forest on 24 August should be fun. No, you silly old romantic, not the football. We want cameras in the boardroom. These days, that’s where the real action is.</p><h2 id=\"live-on-big-website\"><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2><p>Join Sarah Rendell from 8pm BST for MBM coverage of Sweden 2-1 England (aet) in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals.</p><h2 id=\"quote-of-the-day\"><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2><p>“It’s soul-destroying.

McCarthy and receiver Justin Jefferson are continuing to build a rapport together after McCarthy's rookie season was wiped out due to a torn meniscus. <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/video/justin-jefferson-jj-mccarthy-want-130106728.html?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">In an interview with Yahoo Sports' Jason Fitz</a>, Jefferson revealed that the two have spent time together in the offseason to build chemistry on and off the field.</p><p>\"As his teammate and as a captain of the team, just trying to make him dialed in every chance that I can,\" Jefferson said. \"Our lockers are right next to each other, so every chance that I get to talk to him about football, about anything that goes on outside of football. Just try to get to know him as much as I can because when the season comes and whenever we're locked in, I want him to be just as confident as I am of him to make the plays out there.\"</p><p>All signs point towards McCarthy serving as the Vikings starter throughout the 2025 season. After all, Minnesota let Sam Darnoldwalk in free agency and sign a lucrative deal with the Seattle Seahawks -- this, after leading the Vikings to the postseason in 2024. In addition, the Vikings chose not to pursue Aaron Rodgers or other veteran options at the position in the offseason.</p><p>Earlier this offseason, Jefferson revealed that he is a fan of what McCarthy has brought to the table thus far with&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/justin-jefferson-embraces-vikings-leadership-role-details-early-connection-with-qb-j-j-mccarthy/\" target=\"_blank\">his understanding of his role with the team</a></span>.</p>\n        \n\n<p>\"First of all, he understands the role that he has now. He understands that he is the starting quarterback at this moment,\" Jefferson said. \"I feel like he kind of brings that with him to practice, knowing that he has to have that leadership. He's the captain of our team. So I feel like him being right beside me and him trying to learn as much as he needs to, I feel like just his awareness of the game and his intelligence has really grown.\"</p><p>Experience will obviously be the best teacher when it comes to McCarthy being under center. However, the Vikings have made sure to give the former first-round pick all the tools to be successful. McCarthy has a pair to talented wide receivers in Jefferson and Jordan Addison, and Minnesota also improved its offensive line in the offseason by signing guard Will Fries to a five-year, $88 million deal in free agency.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Jefferson is doing his best to help McCarthy transition successfully into the starting role. If McCarthy can enjoy similar success to what Darnold produced last season, the Vikings certainly have all the makings of a team that could be a force in the NFC in 2025.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Culture, coaching, health, luck, but most importantly, talent. Height, weight and speed. The bounces of an oblong ball makes football unpredictable in a fun way. And it is needed, because a bigger, stronger, faster player beating on those smaller, slower and weaker than them produces boring predictable results.</p><p>But how much talent?</p><p>That's the question I set out to answer more than a decade ago when I created the Blue-Chip Ratio.</p><p>Since its inception in 2013, the Blue-Chip Ratio has been referenced by head coaches, cited on every major college football network, and it has even made its way into EA Sports College Football. The calculation is simple, but the implications are significant. It's one of the best tools we have for identifying which teams have the <em>baseline level of talent required</em> to win it all.</p><h2>What is the Blue-Chip Ratio?</h2><p>To win the national championship, college football teams need to sign more four- and five-star recruits than two- and three-star players over the previous four recruiting classes.</p>\n        \n\n<p>That's it -- that's the threshold.</p><p>This has held true for every modern national champion. And while recruiting rankings aren't perfect, they are extremely effective -- especially when taken in the aggregate. And they are only getting better with the advancements in technology and data. A decade ago, for instance, it was not uncommon for about half of first-round picks to have been four- or five-stars. Now? It's routinely 80%+.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/one-bold-prediction-for-every-sec-team-changes-bring-success-for-oklahoma-best-case-cfp-scenario-for-alabama/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>One bold prediction for every SEC team: Changes bring success for Oklahoma, best-case CFP scenario for Alabama</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brad Crawford                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"One bold prediction for every SEC team: Changes bring success for Oklahoma, best-case CFP scenario for Alabama\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/16/d390a0d1-cafc-47cc-aeac-46dd201fa9d6/thumbnail/270x152/436c4dfab32bc74a91721b1aa852dbc9/ou-hype-1.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>What the Blue-Chip Ratio is <em>not</em></h2><p>It is not a requirement to make the College Football Playoff. Teams with sub-50% BCRs have made the four-team field, and many made the 12-team field. But, once you're there, the bar goes up. The difference between <em>making</em> the playoff and <em>winning</em> it is enormous.</p><p>It is not a substitute for culture, coaching, player development, health or quarterback play. All of those things matter. But <em>none of them matter more</em> than talent acquisition when it comes to separating the very good from the elite.</p>\n        \n\n<p>It is not a betting tool for picking games. Please don't use this to pick Week 4 against the spread.</p><h2>How has this stat held up?</h2><p>Here's the full list of modern champions and their Blue-Chip Ratios at the time:</p><ul><li>2024: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> (90%)<strong></strong></li><li>2023: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> (54%)</li><li>2022: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> (77%)</li><li>2021: Georgia (80%)</li><li>2020: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> (83%)</li><li>2019: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> (64%)</li><li>2018: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLEM/clemson-tigers/\">Clemson</a> (61%)</li><li>2017: Alabama (80%)</li><li>2016: Clemson (52%)</li><li>2015: Alabama (77%)</li><li>2014: Ohio State (68%)</li><li>2013: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a> (53%)</li><li>2012: Alabama (71%)</li><li>2011: Alabama (71%)</li></ul><p>Ohio State -- currently tied for second-best odds (+600) to win the 2025 national championship, according to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>&nbsp;-- captured the 2024 national title with a 90% Blue-Chip Ratio, the highest in the history of the metric. It was a strong reminder that even in an era of transfers and NIL, recruiting at an elite level remains the best path to the top.</p><h2>What about transfers?</h2><p>Transfers are not factored into the primary Blue-Chip Ratio. Through four years of intense portal activity, no team has won the national title by building through transfers.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Including transfer player ratings, who are, on average, lacking the upside of the elite high school recruits, makes the rankings less accurate. If you look at the incoming 2025 transfer class, it is lacking at the top. This is, according to people in the personnel space, because teams are doing a better job of holding on to their elite talents with revenue share and NIL money. It looks like the window to even attempt to build through the portal is closing. Programs I spoke with were disappointed in the quality of the portal this year.</p><p>All elite programs recruit high school talent at a high level and use the portal to patch holes. Meanwhile, teams bringing in 30 or 40 transfers are trying to either jumpstart a rebuild or salvage a coaching tenure.</p><p>That said, I will produce an alternate Blue-Chip Ratio with transfers included for your entertainment.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>More on methodology</h2><p>With new roster management rules now in effect, including the end of the 25 initial counter cap and more attention paid to the 85-man limit, it's worth briefly explaining how the BCR is calculated.</p><ul><li>Only signed scholarship players from high school or JUCO count.</li><li>Walk-ons don't count, even if later placed on scholarship.</li><li>If a player signs but never enrolls, he still counts.</li><li>If a player signs, is released and signs elsewhere, he counts for the new school.</li><li>JUCO-bound signees still count -- the school used one of its spots.</li></ul><p>All data is verified manually using the 247Sports Composite, which blends the major recruiting rankings.</p><h2>Enough talk, show me the 2025 Blue-Chip Ratio</h2><table data-title=\"17x2 Table\"><tbody><tr><th>School</th><th>BCR&nbsp;</th></tr><tr><td><p>Alabama&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>89%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ohio State</p></td><td><p>89%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Georgia</p></td><td><p>84%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&amp;M</a></p></td><td><p>82%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a></p></td><td><p>78%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a></p></td><td><p>78%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>LSU</p></td><td><p>73%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a></p></td><td><p>73%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a></p></td><td><p>70%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a></p></td><td><p>68%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a></p></td><td><p>64%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>64%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a></p></td><td><p>64%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Michigan</p></td><td><p>57%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a></p></td><td><p>57%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Clemson&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>55%</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a></td><td>54%</td></tr><tr><td>Florida State</td><td>54%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Tennessee and Florida State return to the fold for the first time in a while. If I had to guess, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SC/south-carolina-gamecocks/\">South Carolina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a> are likely to make the list grow to 20 in 2026, and no other school is remotely close to joining the club.&nbsp;</p><h2>A few notes ...</h2><ul><li>The SEC remains on top in raw numbers, especially now with Texas and Oklahoma in the fold. Nine teams is absurd.</li></ul><ul><li>The Big Ten is right there, with a strong five. Combine that with the Big Ten's edge in culture and retention among its top teams, and it is easy to see why the top of the Big Ten is as good as the SEC.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>The ACC is up with three, and the Big 12 is nowhere close to fielding even one. I thought this was interesting considering the recent playoff model floated where the Big 12 and ACC are given two auto-bids each. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a> could get there in three or four cycles if it continues to spend like crazy. The Big 12 likes to argue that it is the deepest league, but it has zero national title contenders. You could put together an all-star team of the top two Big 12 teams and it wouldn't even be a title favorite. 17 teams had more players drafted than the top Big 12 team did.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Blue-Chip Ratio and the 12-team CFP</h2><p>For over a decade, the BCR has been a binary cutoff for national title contention. But, with the expanded 12-team format debuting last season, it's fair to ask whether a team below the threshold make a deep run?</p><p>Possibly. With the right quarterback and bracket draw like the one Penn State received in 2024, a team sitting just outside the 50% mark -- say, in the mid-40s -- could win a couple games. But even with access more open than ever, <em>winning three or four straight games</em> against elite rosters is a different task.</p><p>History still says the winner will come from the BCR club.</p><h2>Will someone eventually bust the model?</h2><p>At some point ... probably?. A team with a high-40s BCR, a transcendent quarterback and a lot of health luck will probably win it all. It almost happened with Oregon and Marcus Mariota in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>But who might it be this season? Ole Miss? South Carolina? <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LVILLE/louisville-cardinals/\">Louisville</a>? <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAH/utah-utes/\">Utah</a>? See, this is getting a little silly. The top 13 teams in the Vegas odds to win the national title are all BCR members.</p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>The big thing I am watching is whether after the House v. NCAA settlement, talent will begin to spread out in the sport. We have never had a sport where all teams have a shot at the title, but it would be pretty cool if 30 or even 40 teams could potentially have a shot at winning the whole prize at some point in their lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the advent of the BCS in 1998, 14 different programs have won the national title. An additional six have finished as the runner up. &nbsp;</p><p>If that is going to expand, it will have to come via more college football teams deciding to compete for talent. That is easier to do than any time in the last few decades, because it doesn't require moving a college campus closer to talent, or establishing tradition, it just takes outspending the competition. How many more Texas Tech types could we see? Even a few more could help even out the sport a bit.&nbsp;</p><h2>What would Blue-Chip Ratio look like with transfers?</h2><p>Transfers are not part of the core Blue-Chip Ratio calculation. That hasn't changed. But the portal is becoming a larger part of roster construction, and it's worth asking: How different would the BCR look if we included transfer ratings?</p><p>Here's the 2025 list with transfers folded in, using 247Sports' transfer ratings and maintaining a consistent blue-chip threshold.</p><table> <thead><tr><th>School</th><th>BCR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ohio State</td><td>82%</td></tr><tr><td>Alabama</td><td>78%</td></tr><tr><td>Georgia</td><td>77%</td></tr><tr><td>Oregon</td><td>73%</td></tr><tr><td>Texas</td><td>72%</td></tr><tr><td>LSU</td><td>68%</td></tr><tr><td>Notre Dame</td><td>64%</td></tr><tr><td>Texas A&amp;M</td><td>63%</td></tr><tr><td>Penn State</td><td>62%</td></tr><tr><td>Miami</td><td>57%</td></tr><tr><td>Florida</td><td>57%</td></tr><tr><td>Oklahoma</td><td>56%</td></tr><tr><td>Clemson</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td>Florida State</td><td>53%</td></tr><tr><td>Auburn</td><td>53%</td></tr><tr><td>Tennessee</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>USC</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>Michigan</td><td>50%</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Few notes<strong> ...</strong></h2><ul><li>Almost every team sees a drop<strong>.</strong> That's expected. Most transfers, even at top programs, are not rated as blue chips. They're role players, depth or system fits.</li><li>Until we have several years of <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> data to support that portal rankings are accurate predictors of talent, the Blue-Chip Ratio with transfers will remain a sidecar, not the main calculation.</li></ul>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

You wouldn't know, though, since I haven't had a chance to update those rankings <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/fantasy-baseball-top-100-prospects-for-2025-led-by-roki-sasaki-roman-anthony-and-matt-shaw/\" target=\"_blank\">since the preseason</a></span>. </p><p>Thanks to the All-Star break, now I do. And I have. You're seeing the results right here. </p><p>Before you dive in, though, I want to make you aware of a few ground rules. For starters, <strong>only those who have yet to reach the majors were considered</strong>. Prospect eligibility is normally determined by playing-time thresholds -- specifically, 130 at-bats, 50 innings, or 45 days on the active roster. Any player who exceeds those thresholds at the major-league level is no longer a prospect. That's the standard I use for my preseason rank list, anyway. In season, though, I have to be more stringent in order for this rank list to have staying power, so the moment a player is called up, he's out. </p><p>If that feels like a copout to you, well, you're in luck. I can still reveal where the already-debuted prospects would rank <em>if they qualified</em>, and I do so like this: </p>\n        \n\n\n<p>You see? I've just inserted <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075759/roman-anthony/fantasy/\">Roman Anthony</a> ahead of the entire list, which is to say that if he qualified, he'd be No. 1. Here comes another: </p>\n<p>What I'm saying here is that <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426031/chase-burns/fantasy/\">Chase Burns</a> would be No. 2 if he qualified. Any time you see one of these player graphics, it's meant to signal where some already-debuted prospect would theoretically rank.</p><p>Another ground rule: <strong>I've opted not to rank the latest draft class</strong>, as in the one from just a few days ago. It's still so fresh that I don't trust myself to have an honest or reliable assessment of those players, at least not relative to the existing prospects. I've gone back and forth with this over the years, but looking back at where I ranked prominent members of last year's draft class, it's fair to say I have some regrets.</p>\n        \n\n<p>I don't feel like this year's class is as strong anyway. My initial read is that Ethan Holliday, drafted fourth by the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/\">Rockies</a>, would be of the most interest for Fantasy, but Baseball Prospects places him 58th on their midseason list. My list is only a top 50. I've seen others say that top pick Eli Willits is the best choice for Fantasy, and to be fair, Baseball Prospectus ranks him 29th. We'll see how things have shaken out by the time I begin ranking again in the offseason.</p><p>Besides, I'm pretty happy with this selection of 50 and would hate to have to trim it down more.</p><p><em>All stats are updated through Wednesday, July 16.</em>       </p><h2> 1. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29155734/kevin-mcgonigle/fantasy/\">Kevin McGonigle</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong> 20<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Low-A, High-A, Double-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.345 BA (171 AB), 7 HR, 21 2B, 1.028 OPS, 27 BB, 20 K<br> The peak exit velocities are lower than you'd prefer from the top overall prospect, but for a hitter who makes as much contact as McGonigle does, the amount of <em>hard</em> contact is uncanny, solidifying him as an elite hitting talent.<br>       <strong>Second half call-up is ...</strong>&nbsp;possible. </p>\n        \n\n\n<h2>     2. Samuel Basallo, C, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;20<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong> Triple-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong> .264 BA (208 AB), 19 HR, .975 OPS, 39 BB, 55 K<br> Between his Kyle Schwarber-like exit velocities and increased willingness to work the count, I'm tempted to rank Basallo No. 1, but I don't think he's actually a catcher. The Orioles have struggled in recent years to find at-bats for prospects who lack a clear defensive home.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;...</strong> expected.     </p><h2>     3. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426038/konnor-griffin/fantasy/\">Konnor Griffin</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-pirates/\">Pirates</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;19<br>     <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Low-A, High-A<br>     <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.327 BA (303 AB), 13 HR, 41 SB, .921 OPS, 29 BB, 76 K<br> Among the many teenage shortstops populating the top of prospect rank lists right now, rarely is Griffin mentioned first, but he's the one producing at a high level already, which should count for more than it seems to these days.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>...</strong>&nbsp;not happening. &nbsp;     </p><h2>     4. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29339043/leo-de-vries/fantasy/\">Leo De Vries</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">Padres</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;18<br>     <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;High-A<br>     <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.248 BA (266 AB), 6 HR, 6 SB, .765 OPS, 45 BB, 64 K<br> The top international signing from two years ago has been moved so aggressively that it's hard to tell what the Padres have in De Vries. But the fact he hasn't gotten buried by strikeouts against far more advanced pitchers is itself an encouraging sign, particularly given the power projection.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>...</strong>&nbsp;not happening.     </p>\n        \n\n<h2>     5. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29632938/jesus-made/fantasy/\">Jesus Made</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Brewers</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;18<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Low-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.268 BA (276 AB), 4 HR, 38 SB, .772 OPS, 47 BB, 67 K<br> Made is likewise more projection than production at this point, but still far ahead of the curve for an 18-year-old, even though he's a level behind De Vries. He has learned to actualize his speed a little better than De Vries and is expected to grow into power.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>...</strong>&nbsp;not happening.       </p><h2>     6. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426036/jj-wetherholt/fantasy/\">JJ Wetherholt</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a>&nbsp; </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;22<br>     <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Double-A, Triple-A<br> <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.303 BA (234 AB), 8 HR, 14 SB, .912 OPS, 45 BB, 42 K<br> We interrupt this string of projectable shortstops to bring you one whose potential is already realized, with a hit tool that's second only to Kevin McGonigle's. Now, back to our regularly scheduled programming.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>...</strong>&nbsp;possible. &nbsp;     </p><h2>     7. Sebastian Walcott, SS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Rangers</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;19<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Double-A<br> <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.238 BA (302 AB), 9 HR, 20 SB, .719 OPS, 44 BB, 75 K<br> Walcott is a popular choice for top overall prospect, but the reasoning seems to boil down to \"because he's already at Double-A\", which strikes me as a secondary indicator rather than a primary one. He projects for the most power of the teenage shortstops (and as much as anyone in these rankings, really) but has the most downside risk because of a questionable hit tool.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>...</strong> unlikely. </p>\n        \n\n\n<h2>     8. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26912443/bubba-chandler/fantasy/\">Bubba Chandler</a>, SP, Pirates </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;22<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Triple-A<br>     <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;4-2, 2.82 ERA, 1.30 WHIP, 73 1/3 IP, 37 BB, 93 K<br> Chandler should have come up in May, and seemed like he was pressing thereafter, losing his feel for the strike zone. But he's bounced back in recent starts and should soon provide the Pirates with another ace who routinely reaches triple digits.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;...</strong>&nbsp;expected.       </p><h2> 9. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26719591/andrew-painter/fantasy/\">Andrew Painter</a>, SP, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Phillies</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;22<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Low-A, Triple-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;3-5, 4.84 ERA, 1.36 WHIP, 67 IP, 21 BB, 71 K<br> Painter looked like the best pitching prospect in history (only a mild exaggeration) prior to Tommy John surgery in 2022, but hasn't been nearly as effective in his first year back. The stuff appears to be intact, though, apart from some variation in breaking ball shape, so evaluators are, by and large, keeping the faith.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>...</strong>&nbsp;expected.  </p><h2>     10. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29077648/josue-de-paula/fantasy/\">Josue De Paula</a>, OF, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/\">Dodgers</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;20<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;High-A<br>     <strong>2025 stats:</strong> .265 BA (275 AB), 10 HR, 26 SB, .835 OPS, 65 BB, 66 K<br> Perhaps no prospect combines premium exit velocities with premium plate discipline better than De Paula, and he's learned to lift the ball better this year, too.

It's telling that the Giants are fast-tracking him, though.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;...</strong> possible.      </p><h2>     12. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29157418/walker-jenkins/fantasy/\">Walker Jenkins</a>, OF, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/\">Twins</a>&nbsp; </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;20<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Rookie ball, Low-A, Double-A<br>     <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.252 BA (111 AB), 3 HR, 9 SB, .774 OPS, 26 BB, 26 K<br> The fifth pick in the 2023 draft remains more sizzle than steak now in his third full professional season, wowing evaluators with his pretty left-handed swing and 80-grade strike-zone judgment. He'll need to actualize his power soon, though, to retain this high ranking.&nbsp;<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;...</strong>&nbsp;unlikely.       </p><h2>     13. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153542/max-clark/fantasy/\">Max Clark</a>, OF, Tigers </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;20<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;High-A, Double-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.280 BA (271 AB), 8 HR, 12 SB, .850 OPS, 65 BB, 58 K<br> I've been reluctant to embrace Clark, who the Tigers selected with the third overall pick two years ago, but seeing him reach base at a .422 clip while improving his home run output this year has me feeling bullish all of a sudden.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>...</strong>&nbsp;unlikely.     </p>\n        \n\n<h2>     14. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153555/colt-emerson/fantasy/\">Colt Emerson</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Mariners</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;19<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;High-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong> .270 BA (289 AB), 8 HR, .798 OPS, 42 BB, 59 K<br> Emerson's situation is a little like Walker Jenkins' in that he understands the strike zone and certainly <em>looks</em> the part of an elite bat, but at some point, he'll need to deliver on it. He has the floor of a solid regular, though, which is why I'm still giving him the benefit of the doubt.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;...</strong>&nbsp;unlikely.       </p><h2>     15. Zyhir Hope, OF, Dodgers </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong> 20<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;High-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.293 BA (290 AB), 9 HR, 12 SB, .873 OPS, 46 BB, 89 K<br> Part of me wonders if we're looking at another Roman Anthony in Hope, who wasn't really on anyone's radar before the Dodgers acquired him in the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117931/michael-busch/fantasy/\">Michael Busch</a> trade two years ago. I'm showing some restraint because his strikeout rate has run hot this year, but the same was true for Anthony when he was at High-A.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;...</strong>&nbsp;unlikely. </p>\n<h2>     16.

The on-base skills have been impressive, and the capacity for both power and speed remains.&nbsp;<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>...</strong> possible.      </p>\n        \n\n<h2>     17. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29632924/josue-briceno/fantasy/\">Josue Briceno</a>, C, Tigers </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;20<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;High-A, Double-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.296 BA (206 AB), 15 HR, 1.010 OPS, 41 BB, 42 K<br> Like Samuel Basallo, Briceno is a catcher in name only, but don't let his defensive shortcomings distract you from the stone-cold killer he is at the plate. His performance this year comes on the heels of an MVP performance in the Arizona Fall League, where he hit .433 with 10 homers in 25 games against much older competition.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;...</strong>&nbsp;unlikely.       </p><h2>     18. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28839808/lazaro-montes/fantasy/\">Lazaro Montes</a>, OF, Mariners </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;20<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Low-A, High-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;.269 BA (305 AB), 23 HR, .971 OPS, 59 BB, 101 K<br> Concerns remain over his swing-and-miss tendencies and defensive insolvency, but there isn't a minor-league hitter who's figured out how to actualize his power better than Montes.<br>     <strong>Second half call-up is ...</strong>&nbsp;unlikely.       </p><h2>     19. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29376615/jonah-tong/fantasy/\">Jonah Tong</a>, SP, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a> </h2><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;22<br>       <strong>2025 levels:</strong>&nbsp;Double-A<br>       <strong>2025 stats:</strong>&nbsp;6-4, 1.83 ERA, 0.93 WHIP, 35 BB, 125 K<br> Pitchers with an over-the-top delivery aren't supposed to get as much carry on their fastball as Tong does, and the advancement of his secondary offerings this year has rendered hitters helpless against him.

Perhaps we can help. If any of these thoughts come true ... don't be surprised!</em></p><hr><p>We have made quite a few surprising predictions in this weekly space during the first half of the 2025 season, and some of them (but certainly not all!) have turned out to look quite silly. Then again, the point is to go beyond typical thinking when making bold statements. As the league gets ready to start the second half of the season, let's first take a look back at some of the more notable, big-name conjectures from April and May to see how things are turning out.</p><p><b><i>Don't be surprised ... </i> if things don't get significantly better for <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6df06f6-785d-3900-4935-5fd13742e2ee\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\">Boston Red Sox</a> 3B <a data-player-guid=\"9a29840a-6ec6-8b17-995a-f01bc7567f2d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33859/rafael-devers\">Rafael Devers</a> (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/baseball/story/_/id/44517243/fantasy-baseball-espn-news-mlb-surprised-2025-april-3\">from April 3</a>)</b></p><p>Well, they did get better. Devers famously began the season 0-for-19 in five March games, striking out 15 times. Combined with shoulder issues from 2024 that compromised his spring training schedule, there was reason for concern in fantasy. Then Devers hit .356 in May with seven home runs and 33 RBIs. What came next was stunning. Whomever one blames and for whatever reason, Devers is now on the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e072b79c-4fa1-3a55-bdcd-4d7d9734d79b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-giants\">San Francisco Giants</a>, and he is hitting just .202 for them with two home runs in 25 games. For the season, all looks normal. He's on pace for more than 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, with what is already a career high in walks, and typical durability. It's been a weird season, though ultimately not one to run away from in fantasy.</p><p><b><i>Don't be surprised... </i> if <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"a73e1046-e9aa-ef6b-4e0d-2a7c808cb284\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals\">Washington Nationals</a> OF <a data-player-guid=\"05e514e4-4e08-31e8-a7bc-7aa82497d299\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4918256/james-wood\">James Wood</a> becomes a top-10 fantasy outfielder, just like the $765-million man (<a data-player-guid=\"c0225b71-161d-fe89-5c62-d27fa64259fd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a>) he was once included in a trade for (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/baseball/story/_/id/44618678/fantasy-baseball-espn-news-mlb-surprised-2025-april-10\">from April 10</a>)</b></p><p>This one was all about roto/categories leagues, since Soto continues to be a walk machine and thus, he is far more valuable in points formats. The implication here, two weeks into the season, was that the emerging Wood might be a <i>better roto option</i> than the exalted Soto. So far, that has happened. Wood is the No. 10 hitter on the <a href=\"https://fantasy.espn.com/baseball/playerrater\">Player Rater</a>. Soto, thanks mainly to a depressed .262 batting average, is \"only\" No. 15. Let's agree that Wood is an awesome building block (although a high strikeout rate scares us a bit), but there is nothing to worry about with Soto. We appreciate Soto having already stolen 11 bases, just one off his career high. He should reach a career-best runs scored total, too.</p><p><b><i>Don't be surprised ... </i> if <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4fa2cf46-09fc-255f-74a1-2a8857b0e671\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tex/texas-rangers\">Texas Rangers</a> 2B <a data-player-guid=\"7e94f7f5-8502-7d28-e783-61e674f58107\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32146/marcus-semien\">Marcus Semien</a> leads the <a href=\"https://fantasy.espn.com/baseball/addeddropped\">most-dropped list</a> soon (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/baseball/story/_/id/44618678/fantasy-baseball-espn-news-mlb-surprised-2025-april-10\">from April 10</a>)</b></p><p>This one did not happen \"soon\" -- or at all -- and that's a good thing. Semien, long a fantasy favorite for middle-infield production and durability, entered June hitting a sad .193 with four home runs and batting eighth or ninth in Bruce Bochy's (still) underwhelming lineup. Some fantasy managers moved on. Then Semien hit .324 in June with 16 RBI and 18 runs scored. He is the No. 15 second baseman on the Player Rater, No. 4 over the past 30 days. Dropping Semien was a bad call, though it seems clear he is not the player he once was.</p><p>One month later, on May 8, we made the same \"most-dropped list\" proclamation for <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9ca473b8-e73e-a33d-8ea0-b4d160be4be7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-orioles\">Baltimore Orioles</a> C <a data-player-guid=\"ef72b3ad-2cb6-eecb-37ab-24726859d3c5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42178/adley-rutschman\">Adley Rutschman</a>.

While we like the power, Carroll's overall hitting trajectory is worrisome, as he is striking out far more in 2025 than over he did the last two seasons, chasing pitches outside the strike zone. Plus, his 11 stolen bases over 80 games is a disappointing figure, since he stole 54 bases as a rookie.</p><p>This version of Carroll, hitting .245 but on pace for more than 35 home runs, remains quite valuable, but not nearly as much as the 2023 version who was a top-10 fantasy hitter. This version ranks No. 37 among hitters in both roto and points formats -- which is definitely not good value for a top-10 pick. The home run prediction looks good, but the overall value has slipped.</p><p><b><i>Don't be surprised ... </i>if <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> RHP <a data-player-guid=\"cdfd69c1-1b9b-30fe-acf4-aad457b0850e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4719507/paul-skenes\">Paul Skenes</a> fails to win 10 games this season (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/baseball/story/_/id/45266622/fantasy-baseball-espn-news-mlb-surprised-2025-22\">from May 22</a>)</b></p><p>This one, quite unfortunately, is quite realistic, as Skenes hit the break with a 4-8 record in 20 starts. He is not on pace for double-digit victories. Everything else, of course, looks awesome, as Skenes made his second consecutive NL All-Star game start this week. No starting pitcher has a better ERA. Skenes might strike out 200 hitters. Blame Pittsburgh's offense. Comparatively, wins matter more in roto leagues, and Skenes is \"only\" the No. 9 starting pitcher (excluding <a data-player-guid=\"04a76996-4a5c-456d-8022-a9d45e3ff933\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a>) on the Player Rater. He is fourth among starting pitchers in points scored. It feels ridiculous that 103 pitchers have more wins -- through no fault of Skenes -- but it's still true, and wins do matter in most fantasy leagues.</p><p><b><i>Don't be surprised ... </i>if <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> DH/SP Shohei Ohtani breaks the modern mark for runs scored in a season (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/baseball/story/_/id/45372382/fantasy-baseball-espn-news-mlb-surprised-2025-29\">from May 29</a>)</b></p><p>Ohtani enters the second half leading the sport with 91 runs scored, having done so over 95 games. Ohtani has missed two Dodgers games this season -- a notable achievement despite pitching in five games, covering nine innings. There is nobody else like Ohtani. While it remains possible that Ohtani will score more runs than games played, it isn't likely. Still, the lone player to score 150 runs in any season since 1950 is <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"00a3015f-09ec-1b03-52af-656f5e0a18d5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a> 1B Jeff Bagwell in 2000. Ohtani can do this.</p><p>As I wrote in May, I doubt Ohtani helps many fantasy teams with his pitching, as the Dodgers are a near-playoff lock and will cautiously stretch this ace out for meaningful October action, worrying little about August. However, at the plate, even with the expected sharp decline in stolen bases, Ohtani remains a fantasy monster.</p><h2>Other hot takes from early in the season</h2><ul><li><p><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5cda5067-7075-66b1-4b94-2333ab8d9807\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs\">Chicago Cubs</a> OF <a data-player-guid=\"b963b85d-6db2-f0e5-b763-88d4a41c0d73\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/34967/kyle-tucker\">Kyle Tucker</a> seems unlikely to finish as the No. 1 fantasy option (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/fantasy/baseball/story/_/id/44831771/fantasy-baseball-espn-news-mlb-surprised-2025-april-24\">from April 24</a>), mainly because <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2b9cedf3-ce60-0bcf-fafe-8cd055255685\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees\">New York Yankees</a> OF <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a> and Ohtani will not permit it.

The underlying metrics in his seven starts since returning from Tommy John surgery have been eye-popping. The right-hander's average fastball velocity has increased by a noticeable margin, going from 97.5 mph in 2023 to 98.1 this year, and the pitch has the second-highest spin rate of anyone's four-seam fastball (2,662).

He is hitting .312, slugging .578 and has a .386 wOBA against them this year, after posting only .262/.380/.252 such rates in 2023.

And there was perhaps no one on the planet better to meet the moment than Schwarber, the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ff1e263a-f6a6-93c3-1373-418623652ff0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies\">Philadelphia Phillies</a> slugger, who homered on all three of his swings in the impromptu batting practice session to propel the NL to the win (6-6, with a 4-3 edge in homers) in the Midsummer Classic.</p><p>For an All-Star Game that has grown relatively stale in recent years, larded with pitching changes and substitutions, the swing-off lent it an air of freshness and excitement. Amid all of the oddities -- Atlanta Braves fans at a sold-out Truist Park cheering on a star from their hated rival, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> players urging on Schwarber, all of it against the backdrop of the NL blowing a 6-0 lead -- the one constant was Schwarber playing hero at a time of import.</p><p>As the American League blitzed back from a half-dozen-run deficit, the possibility of the swing-off was tantalizingly close -- not just for the wide swath of fans who hadn't known that Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association had agreed to a sudden-death All-Star Game derby, but for the players who had stuck around until the end of the game to bear witness to a contest teeming with pressure -- particularly for an exhibition.</p><p>The rules were simple: NL manager Dave Roberts and AL manager Aaron Boone selected three players and one alternate to take three swings. The team with the most home runs wins the game. As nice as it would have been for <a data-player-guid=\"04a76996-4a5c-456d-8022-a9d45e3ff933\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani\">Shohei Ohtani</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"e3e39e69-2861-f5b5-49be-b0880534c802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33192/aaron-judge\">Aaron Judge</a> to participate, when they made their choices in the days leading up to the game, both managers selected players they anticipated would be warm from finishing on the field: Schwarber, Mets first baseman <a data-player-guid=\"33ba43fd-9a28-0e56-1012-5c9e5881a570\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/37498/pete-alonso\">Pete Alonso</a> and Diamondbacks third baseman <a data-player-guid=\"1a1ec65f-a81f-8ce9-9f38-7275b93a2474\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32367/eugenio-suarez\">Eugenio Suarez</a> for the NL, countering <a data-player-guid=\"0fc2e345-a28a-9c20-023a-e80747e8d0d0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40926/brent-rooker\">Brent Rooker</a> of the A's, Mariners outfielder <a data-player-guid=\"ff4e0d11-a441-34db-29d8-8567b71547b7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36488/randy-arozarena\">Randy Arozarena</a> and Tampa Bay first baseman <a data-player-guid=\"4d197bc2-9bdd-0f37-fb96-21bd05f8ce1e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40810/jonathan-aranda\">Jonathan Aranda</a>.</p><p>Late in the game, with the possibility of a tie three outs away, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fb7cf413-5156-9fc2-abe0-2273b89f70db\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> bench coach Danny Lehmann approached Marlins outfielder <a data-player-guid=\"8359e8e4-86e5-3587-bbd4-5c729d0d54f7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42796/kyle-stowers\">Kyle Stowers</a> and told him if the game did indeed go extra innings, he would need to hit for Suarez, who was removed from the game after being hit by a 100 mph pitch on his hand.</p><p>\"You're f---ing with me,\" Stowers said.</p><p>\"No, I'm seriously not,\" Lehmann said. \"This is real.\"</p><p>\"You're kidding,\" Stowers said.</p><p>\"I'm serious,\" Lehmann said.</p><p>\"I thought I was the young guy getting teased,\" Stowers later said. \"Lo and behold, after the game ends, the managers meet up. And I think, 'This might be for real.'\"</p><p>Boone and Roberts had a finite group from which to choose. Around half the players were gone from the stadium, already headed home after a long, hot week here. Those who stuck around were rewarded with an urgent, entertaining gimmick that put players in a crucible, cranked the temperature and challenged them not to melt.</p><p>The format differed from the Home Run Derby the previous night, during which Seattle catcher <a data-player-guid=\"6c27dcb5-a741-d526-b5ac-f3988e288a70\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41292/cal-raleigh\">Cal Raleigh</a> won a contest that required stamina to make it through minuteslong rounds. The swing-off was different -- reminiscent of the bonus rounds in the Derby during which fans get to admire home runs without the specter of another ball flying off the bat soon thereafter.</p><p>Ohtani wasn't there. Neither was Judge. And it didn't really matter, because the players were undeniably into the results, the sort of reaction that lent credibility to the format. After the AL tied the game on an infield hit from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41996/steven-kwan\">Steve Kwan</a> with two outs and two strikes in the ninth, reigning AL Cy Young winner <a data-player-guid=\"2e709af2-d8bb-3d70-978d-f33a50695c14\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42409/tarik-skubal\">Tarik Skubal</a> -- already in the clubhouse and in his street clothes -- and Kansas City left-hander <a data-player-guid=\"115397d1-d7cb-90d6-43dd-36f2df479e17\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41201/kris-bubic\">Kris Bubic</a> were happy to follow the lead of Minnesota right-hander <a data-player-guid=\"9b1bacc4-95aa-3a7c-903c-52669d180c7a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/42450/joe-ryan\">Joe Ryan</a>, who said: \"We gotta go out and watch this.\"</p><p>They saw a show. And showmanship. And a comeback from a 2-1 deficit after Rooker hit two of his three swings out and Stowers parked one home run. And of course it was delivered by the ultimate showman, Schwarber. The 32-year-old introduced himself a decade ago with five home runs in his first postseason and then equaled that number in the 2023 NL Championship Series. All told, he has 21 homers in 69 postseason games. This was nothing, Schwarber being Schwarber, launching titanic shots in the most opportune of scenarios.</p><p>Even though he never takes batting practice on the field, Schwarber was perfectly thrilled to break that habit for the sake of the NL. With Dodgers third-base coach Dino Ebel throwing, Schwarber used a brand-new bat -- a 99 mph <a data-player-guid=\"1c3e51f0-e619-be48-8aac-443cc62d5b44\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30442/aroldis-chapman\">Aroldis Chapman</a> sinker had broken his lumber in the ninth inning -- and then lined his first swing over the fence to center field. He followed with a high parabola 461 feet into right-center. His final swing was classic Schwarber, taking him down to his back knee, as if he were proposing the swing-off end right there with his third home run, down the right-field line.</p><p>It didn't, not officially: Aranda, one of the breakout hitters of the first half, stepped up and proceeded to hit one ball off Truist Park's brick wall in the outfield. He didn't come close to a home run with two others. NL players rejoiced around Schwarber, leaving Alonso with nothing to do but celebrate the win.</p><p>\"I don't think I'd like that in-season if we lost on it,\" <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"4dec648c-3eb9-055c-aebc-2711f30975a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-padres\">San Diego Padres</a> reliever <a data-player-guid=\"ddbf0d6d-baee-e5d0-46db-ad9b34a08666\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32145/jason-adam\">Jason Adam</a> said. \"But for this setting, it was awesome.\"</p><p>Almost everyone in both clubhouses shared Adam's sentiment. The exigency of a limited-swing Derby -- and the difficulty in going from game to batting practice with essentially a moment's notice -- transfixed players. And the audience, though understandably lamenting the absenteeism of some of the game's biggest stars, mostly embraced the idea as novelty done right.</p><p>\"There's probably a world where you could see that in the future, where maybe it's in some regular-season mix,\" Boone said. \"I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if people start talking about it like that. Obviously, I don't think that should happen, necessarily, or would at any time in the near future. But I've got to say, it was pretty exciting.\"</p><p>Already Tuesday had offered an All-Star Game filled with firsts. The inclusion of the automated ball-strike challenge system saw borderline ball-strike calls overturned by a simple tap on the head. Amid an outing in which he threw nine of his 18 pitches at 100-plus mph, rookie sensation <a data-player-guid=\"0ea828df-ab12-3e43-8900-dee0563e68d4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080761/jacob-misiorowski\">Jacob Misiorowski</a> unleashed an ungodly 98.1 mph slider so nasty it awed players in both dugouts.</p><p>In the end, it was an electric night for baseball, with Schwarber serving as the conduit. And when Jon Shestakofsky of the National Baseball Hall of Fame went to collect the bat Schwarber used to go 3-for-3 -- a decade after Schwarber gave the Hall his bat used to collect the MVP award of the Futures Game -- he noticed not a single scratch or sign that the bat had even been used.</p><p>\"No ball marks when you flush it,\" Schwarber said.</p><p>He had indeed -- and in the process lent validity to the idea that the swing-off could be an entertaining way to cap All-Star week. Players around both clubhouses said they would consider signing up for the swing-off next year -- and Stowers said the swing-off made him want to participate in the Home Run Derby in the future. The champion of this year's Derby was perfectly content to share the spotlight with Schwarber.</p><p>\"It's good for the game, it's good for baseball, it's good for the fans,\" Raleigh said.</p><p>And that's the point, right? All of the consternation over Misiorowski making the NL team after just 25⅔ major league innings ignored a fundamental element of All-Star week -- as much as it's to reward the players, it's to grow the game's fandom, too.</p><p>Tuesday's swing-off was baseball balm, surprisingly comforting, and sent the game into its second half with momentum. The trade deadline will provide that tension for the next two weeks and pennant races thereafter. The game is in a good place because it is evermore the realm of the unforeseen and unknowable.</p><p>We might not get many of these -- only 13 past Midsummer Classics have gone to extra innings -- which will only increase its charm, allowing the swing-off to become the most pleasant of surprises. As we saw Tuesday, there is glory in the pressure, the stress, the thrill of knowing you've got only three swings. It's a beautiful little distillation of baseball, exceptional in portioned doses.</p>\n</div></div>"

The Eagles once again look primed for a championship run and will enter the 2025 NFL season as the betting favorites at +650 (risk $100 to win $650) to win Super Bowl 60. Despite their standing as the top team in the 2026 Super Bowl odds, there are still numerous longshot futures bets available for the Eagles heading into the 2025 regular season.&nbsp;</p><p>Longshot bets, or betting hot takes, typically come with NFL odds that would imply the bet is unlikely to hit. One example of a betting hot take for the Eagles in 2025 would be taking Saquon Barkley to go over 1,000 rushing and 1,000 receiving yards during the regular season. DraftKings Sportsbook offers this bet at +4000 odds, and given that Barkley's best receiving season came as a rookie in 2018, backing this bet would qualify as a hot take.&nbsp;</p><p>SportsLine expert handicapper Jimmie Kaylor has broken down the latest <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">betting</a> trends and NFL futures odds on the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">best betting apps</a></span> and locked in five betting hot takes for the Eagles in 2025.

New users can even take advantage of the&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\">DraftKings promo code</a></span>&nbsp;offering <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&amp;c=sport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored mtech\">$150 in bonus bets instantly with a $5 wager</a>.</p><p>Kaylor posted a 55-34-4 record on NFL point spread and over/under picks during the 2024 season, profiting 15.78 units ($1,578 for a $100 bettor). Here are his five hot takes:</p><h2>The Eagles will score 1+ rushing touchdown in all 17 regular season games</h2><p>This prop is available on DraftKings and is currently priced at +600. The Eagles were a dominant rushing team in 2024, scoring 29 touchdowns on the ground. The combination of running back Saquon Barkley and quarterback Jalen Hurts gives Philadelphia arguably the premier red zone rushing attack in the NFL.

I've already listed the Ravens as my early favorite to win Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara next February, and the Eagles are still the team to beat in the NFC in my eyes. There is a long season to play and a lot could happen between now and February. That said, this is what i feel is the most likely Super Bowl outcome today, and +2800 offers a great value.

This exact prop bet wasn't available at the time of publication, but you can parlay the Giants (-1500), Cowboys (-240), and Commanders (+112) to all miss the postseason for a payout of +328.

The 26-year-old has scored 10 or more rushing touchdowns in four straight seasons, including a career high 15 in 2023. Hurts finished with 14 rushing scores in 2024, which was only two behind league leaders Derrick Henry, James Cook, and Jahmyr Gibbs. Hurts is currently listed at +550 on this prop market at BetMGM.

Nothing too bad,” Pogacar tells Matt Stephens after his crash yesterday. “My whole left arm is open, burned off skin. And I hit my hip a little bit and my shoulder, but luckily I was back on the bike quite fast. Today is another day. It’s not the first time I crashed and continued the race. It’s more important the legs than my arm. I have a super-strong team around me. I am so grateful I can rely on them, even if I have a hard day today, but I hope not. “It’s really sad to lose another young talent,” Pogacar says of Samuele Privitera’s death at the Giro della Valle d’Aosta yesterday. “It’s devastating. It’s one of the most dangerous sports in the world. Sometimes the risks we are taking are too far. I’m really sad for all his family. May he rest in peace … he deserves to “not be bothered” now. It’s a sad loss.”  Continue reading...",

Traditionally a rider’s peak was 28 to 32, now you’re seeing 21-year-olds winning Grand Tours. So it is becoming a little bit extinct, because riders are so good, so young. I’d be all for it. To replace the white with the grey would be quite cool. Any rider who’s performing at that level at 35 or above, you have to say chapeau, because they’ve done it for 15 years, give or take. That deserves a round of applause in itself.

Mickelson distilled at the par-three 3rd!</strong> His tee shot plugs under the lip of a pot bunker. It’s almost impossible to escape. He opens the face of his wedge and lashes hard … but even this genius can’t get the ball out. It slams into the face and rolls back into the middle of the trap. But take two is something else. He swishes smoothly, sending his ball high, landing it 15 feet to the right of the pin, and using a combination of camber and spin to roll serenely into the cup! Par. You knew that was going in once it took it’s left-turn screech and rolled out. He raises both arms in the air as the crowd go wild. He remains at -1. That’s one of the shots of the week <em>already</em>. Disaster averted in sensational style, and with such skill and panache. Mickelson in microcosm.

repairs the damage of that bogey on 14, but his 55-foot putt from the bottom of a swale to the side of the green stops a couple of turns short. A good par save nonetheless, and he remains at level par.</p></article><article id=\"block-6878fc408f08d8212cd748c0\"><header></header><p><strong>We mentioned Sergio’s near-miss at Hoylake in 2014.</strong> That year was the closest Rickie Fowler came; he finished in a tie for second with Garcia. Such a shame Fowler’s never come good on his early major-championship promise – though he does have the unofficial fifth major, the Players, on his resumé. Still, at 36, the Californian has time, and there’d be no more popular winner. Well, OK, Rory, Shane, Tom McKibbin, but you get the general point. Anyway, Fowler has started well, and now birdies 7. That’s three birdies in four holes, and he’s -2 for his round so far.</p></article><article id=\"block-6878fa1d8f08054cc665db17\"><header></header><p><strong>Matt Fitzpatrick slam-dunks from the bottom of a rough-strewn swale to the side of the par-three 16th!</strong> Like a bizarro, inverted version of Mark Calcavecchia from atop a heavily grown bank at Troon’s 12th in 1989. Calc went on to win that year; now will that augur well for the 2022 US Open champion this week? A few more holes to go, admittedly, seeing the American performed his ball-disappearing magic trick on the Sunday.</p><p><em>-4: JS Olesen (F), Li (F), Fitzpatrick (16)<br>\n  -3: Jordan (F), Kaewkanjana (8)<br>\n  -2: N Højgaard (F), Westwood (F), Kawamoto (8), Svensson (7), Fowler (7), Garcia (6)</em></p></article><article id=\"block-6878f9038f081f68b7841a81\"><header></header><p><strong>Matthew Jordan pars the last and signs for a fine opening round of 68.</strong> He’s delighted to get back home, because he had some scrambling to do along the final stretch as conditions got a wee bit trickier.

Sergio has had his heart broken once or twice at the Open, most notably at Hoylake in 2014, when his bid crumbled to sand in a bunker at 15, and at Carnoustie in 2007, when he led after the first three rounds only to bogey the 72nd and lose to Padraig Harrington in a play-off. Probably shouldn’t have tempted fate by dressing as Ronald McDonald, the world’s most famous clown, on the Saturday that year. Anyway, he’s in much more demure black with red flashes today … and he’s just followed up birdie at the short par-four 5th with another at 6, after sending his tee shot to nine feet and tidying up. He’s -2 and … he couldn’t, could he? Well, at 45 years of age, the odds are against, though the Open does love a fortysomething winner, even in recent years – Darren Clarke, Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson – so let’s not rule anything out.

I’ve had a few pennies on local man Tom McKibbin this week and followed him for the first six holes in an entertaining three-ball also featuring Padraig Harrington and Nicolai Hojgaard. McKibbin struggled early and had to sink a testy par putt to avoid dropping to +3. But he made that putt at 4, birdied 5 and, as I walked back to the media centre, McKibbin’s name magically appeared at the top of the leaderboard. Clearly freed up by the aversion of my penetrating gaze, he’d eagled the par-5 7th. He added another at 9 to go to -2 but, just as I sat down in the press canteen for a full English (£11 if you’re interested; we get a £30 food card so that’s a third of the budget gone), I watched him on one of the TVs in there hacking around in rough at 11. He racked up a double bogey, as did Hojgaard. Both bounced back with birdie at 12 to get into red figures again and Hojaard as added another at 13 to make it bunched a the top.</p></article><article id=\"block-6878bb558f081f68b78416d4\"><header></header><p><strong>Thanks Scott.</strong> Ludicrous claim but thankyou.

If the game gets to  the 12th, then they could have a swing-off. I know purists would scream,  but there has to be a mechanism to end the game at some point in this  era of so many pitcher injuries. I'm good with leaving the runner on  second and not doing this, but could be talked into the swing-off in the  12th or 13th or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>R.J. Anderson:</strong> I guess I would be fine with it after the 11th or 12th inning. I don't  mind the current setup, though, and I do wonder if people would miss it,  given it's a closer approximation of the actual game, once the novelty  wore off the swing-off aspect. I will acknowledge the pitcher injury  aspect is a fair consideration.  </p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Mike Axisa:</strong> Nah. Leave it with the All-Star Game. There is one extra-innings game every 11 games league-wide, give or take, so at least one a night, usually. The novelty will wear off quickly. The magic that happened during the All-Star Game was organic and you can't recreate that. I do think a swing-off is more entertaining than the automatic runner in extra innings. I just want baseball games to be decided by baseball players, not the first base coach throwing BP. The All-Star Game was extremely fun Tuesday. Let's leave the swing-off where it is, and not give baseball its version of a shootout.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div>\n\n    </div></div>"

He was a two-division, five-time world champion and is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Bradley is also the recipient of the 2023 Sam Taub award for Excellence in Broadcast Journalism.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p>Manny Pacquiao is coming out of retirement at age 46, just a month after his induction into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Boxing's only eight-division world champion will return to the ring at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on Saturday to face 30-year-old WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios (Amazon Prime Video PPV, PPV.com, 8 p.m. ET).</p><p>This will not be an easy fight for Pacquiao after a long layoff. Barrios won the WBC interim title in September 2023, made one successful defense in May 2024 and was elevated to full champion ahead of his fight against Abel Ramos on November's Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson undercard. Barrios, a tall fighter for the division at 6-foot, was knocked down by Ramos in Round 6 of an entertaining fight. Despite the scare, Barrios eked out a 12-round split decision.</p><p>Yet, Barrios holds one of the most impressive résumés among today's 147-pound champions. He owns a 2023 victory over Yordenis Ugas, who beat Pacquiao in August 2021, a loss that sent the Filipino legend into retirement. Barrios has also shared the ring with elite names such as Keith Thurman and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/38782247/gervonta-davis-biography-boxing-record-fights-more\">Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis</a>, both of whom handed him losses but provided him invaluable experience. Still, Barrios might be the weakest link among current welterweight champions, and that alone may explain Pacquiao's motivation for his return. This return isn't just about a paycheck; it's about adding to his legacy.</p><p>In July 2019, Pacquiao became the oldest welterweight champion ever, at 40, by defeating Thurman in a performance that defied Father Time. Now he wants to surpass Bernard Hopkins, one of boxing's all-time greats, as the oldest world champion in the sport's history. Hopkins defeated Jean Pascal in 2011 at age 46 for the WBC light heavyweight title, then outdid himself at 48 by beating Tavoris Cloud for the IBF belt. The second-oldest champion was George Foreman, who reclaimed the heavyweight title at 45 by knocking out Michael Moorer in 1994.</p><p>But there's a critical difference between what \"Big George\" did on his run, what Hopkins accomplished and what Pacquiao is attempting to do: Hopkins stayed active throughout his twilight years, and Foreman was active for 10 years during his return to the heavyweight crown. Pacquiao (62-8-39 KOs) has been out of the ring for over four years. There have been no tuneups, just a couple of exhibitions in 2022 and one in 2024. Jumping back into the fire with a hungry champion such as Barrios, who is naturally bigger, longer (with a 71-inch reach) and stronger, makes Pacquiao's attempt alarming and historic.</p><hr><h3>What it feels like to face Pacquiao</h3><p>I had the privilege of sharing the ring with Pacquiao on three occasions: 2012, 2014 and 2016. Each encounter brought a unique experience, driven by where he was in his career and where I was in mine. In 2012, Pacquiao was still at the height of his illustrious career. He hadn't lost in seven years and had just come off a remarkable run, defeating some of the sport's biggest names, icons such as Oscar De La Hoya, \"Sugar\" Shane Mosley, Miguel Cotto, Marco Antonio Barrera, Erik Morales and Antonio Margarito. Stepping into the ring with him for the first time, I imagined I was fighting a titan. Beyond the magnitude of the event, I found myself face to face with a charismatic and humble man whose soft-spoken voice and respectful demeanor draped over him like an invisible veil, contrasting to what stood across the ring from me on fight night.</p><p>The ring announcements felt shorter than in any other championship fight I'd had. My legs trembled uncontrollably as I bounced up and down to wake them. When I stopped bouncing, my legs would feel numb, as if they had been removed. Standing across from Pacquiao before the first bell rang, I could feel the weight of his presence. His aura was heavy, almost weakening me.</p><p>Pacquiao is, without question, the most outstanding athlete I've ever shared the ring with. Every movement he made was sharp, deliberate and unnervingly precise. His footwork and body feints kept me guessing and on edge, constantly tense, never knowing when his unorthodox combinations would deploy. His hand speed was deceptive and his sense of distance and his ability to change pace and rhythm made it all the more challenging.</p><p>What looked manageable in film studies felt overwhelming in real life. His first step into midrange came like lightning in an instant, and the moment he let his hands go, everything instantly became chaotic. I learned quickly that the crowd is his lifeline of energy. The more he gave it something to cheer about, the more ferocious he would become.</p><p>Pacquiao was far harder to hit than I had expected. His punching power was stunning; every connected shot sent a jolt through my head, and even the ones that missed sliced the air like bullets, whistling past my ears. When I did land something clean, he would clap his gloves together in defiance as if to say, \"That all you got?\" His stamina was unreal; his engine never stopped running. But what truly set him apart, though, was his tenacity and elite ring IQ. Try repeating a punch pattern twice, and you would find yourself eating a blazing fast counter from an unpredictable angle, his footwork in perfect sync with his hands, in short, explosive, choppy steps.</p><p>What made Pacquiao especially dangerous was his ability to sense when his opponent was fading. He could feel it, and that's when he would turn up the heat. His strength was highly unusual for his size, at roughly 5-foot-6.</p><p>Let's make this clear: Pacquiao's B, C and D games are better than most fighters' A game. Special fighters like him aren't manufactured. They're born. But 46 years of age is still 46.</p><hr><h3>How the fight could play out: Pacquiao's athleticism vs. Barrios' left hook</h3><p>Expect Pacquiao to turn this fight into a battle from the opening bell. He'll look to push the pace and close distance by disrupting Barrios' rhythm with feints, head movement, throwing combinations and using his sharp footwork. In training videos, Pacquiao still flashes glimpses of his legendary hand speed and footwork. He'll try to use that to explode forward with quick flurries and angle changes before Barrios can understand when to counter.</p><p>Pacquiao, the shorter man, knows he can't stay at long range. That's Barrios' comfort zone, where he can use his long jab, straight rights, looping shots and hooks with full power. To nullify that, Pacquiao must close the gap and attack Barrios' long torso. Those body shots are necessary to slow down Barrios' legs, drain his stamina and reduce his snap, timing and will throughout the fight.</p><p>Being a southpaw gives Pacquiao a tactical edge. Barrios hasn't faced many lefties in his career, and the last time he did, against Davis in 2021, he was peppered by left hands to the body and head and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/31717260/gervonta-davis-becomes-3-division-champion-tko-victory-mario-barrios\">was ultimately stopped</a>. I'm sure Pacquiao will try to mimic some of that success, using feints to mask his signature punch, the straight left hand, which he disguises with head movement and a step with his lead foot to the right, slipping outside and away from the peripheral vision of his opponent and firing straight down the middle with a sneaky left cross.</p><p>But this fight will not come without risks for Pacquiao. Once powered by his incredible athleticism, Pacquiao now will be left vulnerable by his explosive lunges and reaching. The older you get, the timing and balance don't always line up perfectly. And Barrios' counterpunching and game plan discipline will capitalize on those mistakes. He's not the kind of fighter who overreacts like Pacquiao; he likes to wait, time his opponent and punch with intent at the perfect distance, taking care of offense and defense simultaneously.</p><p>Barrios will likely stay composed early, content to let Pacquiao initiate the pace and expend energy. He'll start working behind a steady jab, using it to bust up Pacquiao's face and disrupt his rhythm. He'll pepper Pacquiao from the outside, and when Manny steps in with combinations, Barrios will look to time him with counters, particularly the straight right hand, a punch that has troubled the southpaw Pacquiao throughout his career.</p><p>Barrios' left hook could be a sneaky game changer, especially to the body. Remember, Pacquiao has struggled with calf cramps throughout his career, and if Barrios invests in body work early, it could take the strength, steam and snap out of Pacquiao's legs, eliminating his dynamic footwork and movement. As the fight gets deeper into the later rounds, Pacquiao's pace and pressure might begin to slow. His early energy likely will fade, and Barrios will have opportunities to take over the action, remaining behind the jab and continuing to control distance. Once he believes Pacquiao is fading, he should attack him with counters that might hurt Pacquiao. Barrios is very disciplined in the ring. He fights smart, never letting the moment overwhelm him, and he'll make small adjustments during the chaos Pacquiao loves to bring. He'll show maturity by sticking to the game plan: manage distance and punish Pacquiao for his mistakes.</p><hr><h3>Pacquiao in decline? Let's look at the numbers</h3><p>As fighters age and fade from their physical prime, there's often a noticeable decline, not just in activity levels but also in accuracy, reflexes and recovery. Older fighters might become more technical, taking fewer risks and relying on experience rather than volume or speed. But with that calculated caution comes reduced output and less physical ability to adapt under higher resistance.</p><p>In his fight against Ugas, Pacquiao didn't just look a step behind, but he looked like he had aged overnight. Ugas' composed counterpunching and sharp accuracy exposed the wear and tear of a long, restless career. Pacquiao's legendary footwork and timing, once razor-sharp, seemed obsolete. Ugas' reach, power, counterpunching and steady feet proved too much for the icon.</p><p>Ugas outlanded Pacquiao in total punches (151-130), jabs (50-42) and power punches (101-88). Ugas also connected on 59% of his power punches. For the first time, it became undeniable that Pacquiao had finally hit the wall that all great fighters eventually hit. Four years later, imagining any form of Pacquiao resurgence isn't easy. Time hasn't paused. Barrios is not only 16 years younger but also sharper and fresher. And he's undoubtedly experienced.</p><p>Barrios possesses many traits that troubled Pacquiao against Ugas, such as steady footwork, acute timing, an excellent jab and the energy that comes with youth. Don't let the video clips on social media fool you. Those Pacquiao shadowboxing sessions in parking lots, the blazing hand speed on the mitts or the thousands of crunches he grinds out look great. But looking great in the gym or against air doesn't equate to being fight-ready under live fire after lengthy inactivity.</p><p>Remember how sharp Tyson looked on the pads before his exhibition with Paul? It's one thing to look tremendous when no one's hitting back. It's an entirely different battle when your body begs for recovery, and it no longer comes as quickly. Reaction time slows and recovery stretches longer as we age. I know. Endurance, resilience and reflexes come naturally for the young. Yes, Pacquiao still has the heart of a warrior and will give whatever he has left in the tank, but Father Time is undefeated. Even his warrior spirit might not be enough to overcome this cherry-picked champion in the welterweight division.</p><hr><h3>Who wins?</h3><p>This won't be an easy fight for either Pacquiao or Barrios. Pacquiao will have his moments, maybe even rock Barrios with combinations, and his speed will win rounds. However, as the 12 rounds wear on and Pacquiao slows down, Barrios' reach, sharp counters and grit will show that Pacquiao is beatable at this stage of his career. Ultimately, Barrios wins a hard-fought unanimous decision, not by domination but by being what he needs to be on this night. He will beat a legend, but one far out of his prime.</p>\n</div></div>"

The Cannons looked lost, reeling in all departments after consecutive setbacks to the Redwoods and Atlas. I would anticipate lineup and schematic adjustments from coach Brian Holman.

One surprising stat: Powell, who is coming off a career year, is a month <i>older</i> than Beal.</p><p>Still, I can get why the Clippers preferred having both Beal and Collins to Powell and whoever else they could have added using the remainder of their non-taxpayer midlevel exception, even if it cost them a second-round pick (sent to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77cea2fb-1388-b7c8-d171-2e72b3aecbfb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/utah/utah-jazz\">Utah Jazz</a> in the trade) to make that exchange.</p><p>Although he's no longer an All-Star, Beal's skill set scales down well. More of a volume 3-point shooter during his high-scoring days with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"64d73af6-b8ec-e213-87e8-a4eab3a692e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/wsh/washington-wizards\">Washington Wizards</a>, Beal hit 41% of his 3s during two seasons with the Suns. And with his role on offense diminished, Beal put more of his energy toward creating for others and defense, two important factors for the Clippers.</p><p>Specifically, Beal's most important benefit to the Clippers seems to be leading a second-unit backcourt alongside <a data-player-guid=\"db759921-c2d4-28de-f1eb-66f1c0aa708f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3037789/bogdan-bogdanovic\">Bogdan Bogdanovic</a> with Harden on the bench. Without a traditional point guard behind Harden at the moment -- though <a data-player-guid=\"63c7648a-60ba-c799-d355-f7f1d43f3a55\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul\">Chris Paul</a> remains an unrestricted free agent -- the Clippers appear headed toward having Beal and Bogdanovic fill that role by committee.</p><p>Though the idea of Beal as a starting point guard lost its luster in Phoenix, he and Bogdanovic should provide sufficient playmaking against second units.</p><p>Presumably, the Clippers will at least begin the season accomplishing that goal by staggering Beal's minutes with Harden's after they start together in the backcourt. It's hard to see Beal signing up for a return to the bench after unhappily playing that role during the second half of last season.</p><p>Come the playoffs, assuming the Clippers get there in a loaded Western Conference, Ty Lue's decisions on which players to start could become more complicated. Starting Collins alongside <a data-player-guid=\"314d5203-a973-39ef-ad47-e6bcd46f77fd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4017837/ivica-zubac\">Ivica Zubac</a> in the frontcourt might be the Clippers' best option, but that would leave <a data-player-guid=\"87ff907c-c68c-a82d-1215-37e05d0c62ef\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a> as the team's primary wing defender, a role the Clippers probably want to take off his plate as much as possible to keep Leonard fresh for offense. <a data-player-guid=\"3bf37b82-bc22-d882-7cfa-0092b896e87a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991139/kris-dunn\">Kris Dunn</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"43d66d12-a645-9585-46c2-d9d5fc2eb879\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936099/derrick-jones-jr\">Derrick Jones Jr</a>. might fit better starting on the wing than Beal in that scenario.</p><p>At this point, we'll consider that a good problem. The Clippers have an 82-game regular season to get through, and their depth will be important given the amount of time Beal -- who last played more than 53 games in the shortened 2020-21 campaign -- and Leonard tend to miss.</p><p>Adding Beal at a max salary, particularly given the complication of his no-trade clause, proved a net negative for the Suns. The story is different now that the Clippers are getting him at a wildly different price point, with a player option giving Beal the chance to make up the money he gave back in a buyout or potentially even come out ahead if he plays well this season.</p><p>It's worth addressing the Phoenix side of the equation. To some degree, the Suns might have benefited from the NBA rule limiting how much dead salary teams can have on their books after completing a waive-and-stretch. That meant Beal had to agree to reduce his guaranteed salary by nearly $14 million at a minimum for a legal buyout of this type, putting a floor on negotiations.</p><p>Like the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f59bbabc-eedb-9ad2-c5dd-9bcd9f450a2f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks\">Milwaukee Bucks</a> with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6606/damian-lillard\">Damian Lillard</a>, the Suns will have Beal's salary on their books for five years if they agree to stretch it, with the upside of possibly getting out of the luxury tax altogether, per ESPN's Bobby Marks.</p><p>Before we see how Phoenix responds, I wouldn't take this as an indication that owner Mat Ishbia is retrenching on spending along the lines of what we saw with Mikhail Prokhorov in Brooklyn after the Nets' trade for Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce went bust.</p><p>After all, the limitations on teams spending over the second luxury tax apron in the new collective bargaining agreement mean there are basketball benefits to the Suns reducing their payroll by stretching Beal's salary. In fact, they could use the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel exception now, though it's unclear there are any free agents remaining that would sign up for that but not the veteran's minimum.</p><p>Getting out of the second apron will allow Phoenix to aggregate salaries in trades and mean the Suns will have access to their non-taxpayer midlevel exception next summer if they lose center <a data-player-guid=\"93b211a2-3229-3b90-8529-f7f39ce5374d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4701232/mark-williams\">Mark Williams</a> as a restricted free agent or he re-signs for his qualifying offer.</p><p>I'm still not sure stretching Beal's salary will prove better for the Suns on the court in the long term than just riding out his remaining two seasons, but given how unpleasant his time in Phoenix seemed for both sides, I understand the desire to simply move on.</p><hr><h2>July 10: Thunder extend Williams on a five-year deal</h2><ul><li><p><em>Oklahoma City Thunder agreed to a five-year, maximum extension with forward <a data-player-guid=\"2381f346-9247-3ba1-b632-fcef378a2799\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4593803/jalen-williams\">Jalen Williams</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/okc.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade:</strong> Pass (extensions graded on a pass/fail scale)</p><p>The third and presumably final max rookie extension for a 2022 first-round pick essentially split the difference between the first two.</p><p>Like <a data-player-guid=\"b121848a-30d3-3fad-b6ab-74bf04005533\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432573/paolo-banchero\">Paolo Banchero</a> of the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"74c23102-8c27-c8e6-ec1b-8a8fd4d42554\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic</a>, the other 2022 first-rounder to make an All-Star Game, Williams received 30% max criteria in his deal that will increase its value to a maximum of a projected $287 million if he makes All-NBA first team this season or is voted MVP or Defensive Player of the Year.</p><p>Given Williams was an All-NBA third-team pick last season at age 23, the Thunder should certainly prepare as if he'll make more than the 25% max teammate <a data-player-guid=\"d28316e9-20cc-3cb2-b5d7-afdb6418315b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433255/chet-holmgren\">Chet Holmgren</a> will get on his max extension, agreed to Wednesday.</p><p>As with Holmgren, Williams did not get the player option that Banchero secured in his extension. That's especially important as Oklahoma City plans well into the future. Williams wouldn't begin a potential supermax extension -- or hit unrestricted free agency -- until 2031-32 at the earliest.</p><p>Given Williams has accomplished more through three seasons than Banchero, including averaging 23.6 points in the NBA Finals, he certainly had a case for securing a player option.</p><p>From a big-picture standpoint, the Thunder now have both Holmgren and Williams under contract through 2030-31 and MVP <a data-player-guid=\"4dcec409-3ff9-2881-2bc3-b4289ce6c36d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander\">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a> signed through 2029-30 (with a player option for 2030-31) after he completed his own supermax extension last week.</p><p>The size of those contracts, which guarantee the three players approximately 85% of the salary cap when Gilgeous-Alexander's deal begins in 2027-28, will present challenges to Oklahoma City maintaining its depth. But the Thunder have been planning for that moment since before drafting Holmgren and Williams and have the financial flexibility and draft picks to ensure continued contention throughout their stars' prime years.</p><hr><h2>July 9: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45705332/devin-booker-agrees-2-year-145m-max-extension-suns\">Booker gets max extension from Suns</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6eade89-5971-0e84-8ccb-cd91482b2b50\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a> agreed to a reported two-year, max extension with guard <a data-player-guid=\"493046d7-fa60-d8a1-1397-b9a6dca8dedf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/phx.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade:</strong> Fail (extensions graded pass/fail)</p><p>This extension adds two years to Booker's contract, which already runs through 2027-28, starting at the maximum 35% of the cap when it's set in the summer of 2028. Currently, that's estimated at $70 million, which could be the largest salary in the NBA depending on how much the cap grows from the 2026-27 season, when <a data-player-guid=\"4dcec409-3ff9-2881-2bc3-b4289ce6c36d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander\">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a> begins a supermax extension.</p><p>It doesn't take advanced statistical projections to suggest that Booker will probably not merit a $70 million-plus salary. Despite playing 75 games last season, his most since 2016-17, Booker was neither chosen an All-Star nor to an All-NBA team. He's made All-NBA just twice in his career and only received MVP votes once. (That came in 2021-22, when Booker finished fourth in the voting and was chosen for the All-NBA first team.)</p><p>During his prime, Booker has been more like a top 25 NBA player than a top 10 one. And while he should still be an All-Star contender by the time this extension kicks in, shortly before his 32nd birthday, it's more likely that Booker will be a complementary piece than the centerpiece the Suns have made him.</p><p>It's understandable that Phoenix would value a star player who wants to be there after the Suns traded <a data-player-guid=\"dc324fde-eee8-98e2-09ac-d31d8ad9909e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a> and as they consider a buyout for <a data-player-guid=\"fb35d5ac-5dde-c5ee-98f3-c348c244c0ae\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6580/bradley-beal\">Bradley Beal</a>. Booker has played his entire career in Phoenix and was the most important catalyst as the Suns went from 10 consecutive seasons in the lottery to the 2021 NBA Finals. Yes, <a data-player-guid=\"63c7648a-60ba-c799-d355-f7f1d43f3a55\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul\">Chris Paul</a> was key to that season, but Paul likely would not have come to Phoenix without the promise Booker showed.</p><p>Still, Booker's loyalty didn't translate into any kind of discount, and the Suns are taking a considerable risk by agreeing to this extension with so much time remaining on Booker's current contract.</p><p>One key question in evaluating any extension is whether a player will have more trade value after striking the deal. In this case, because Booker will get the maximum raise between the two seasons of the deal, he won't be tradeable for six months. The question is more a hypothetical one. I suspect Booker would have more value to other teams on his current contract.</p><p>Certainly, Phoenix hopes that question is moot and the team can rebuild a contender around him. In the event the Suns' missing draft picks and a potential stretch of Beal's contract doom them to remain in the lottery, either Booker's commitment to The Valley or his trade value might be tested before this extension even begins.</p><hr><h2>July 9: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45700873/chet-holmgren-agrees-rookie-max-extension-thunder\">Holmgren agrees to max deal with OKC</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bd458c44-2d33-47eb-cebc-35d3d4ac595c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder\">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> agreed to a reported five-year, max rookie extension with center <a data-player-guid=\"d28316e9-20cc-3cb2-b5d7-afdb6418315b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433255/chet-holmgren\">Chet Holmgren</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/okc.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade:</strong> Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail)</p><p>Compared with the other two max rookie extensions we expect from the 2022 first round -- one for <a data-player-guid=\"b121848a-30d3-3fad-b6ab-74bf04005533\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432573/paolo-banchero\">Paolo Banchero</a> reported Monday and one yet to be completed with Holmgren's Thunder teammate <a data-player-guid=\"2381f346-9247-3ba1-b632-fcef378a2799\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4593803/jalen-williams\">Jalen Williams</a> -- this was a bit less of a no-brainer.</p><p>From a performance standpoint, Holmgren has met expectations since being drafted No. 2 behind Banchero. He finished second to <a data-player-guid=\"0e8844b2-d923-3926-82d2-f19a29d69490\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama\">Victor Wembanyama</a> in Rookie of the Year voting and was one of three double-figure scorers for Oklahoma City during the team's championship run.</p><p>Given Holmgren's ability to impact a game at both ends with his 37% career 3-point shooting and 2.3 blocks per game, there's a case to be made that he has been more effective on a per-minute basis than Banchero despite not being named to an All-Star team.</p><p>Yet durability remains a concern with Holmgren, who has missed extended periods due to a pair of rare, serious injuries -- a Lisfranc fracture that sidelined him his entire first NBA season and a hip fracture in November. He has played just 114 regular-season games, compared with 198 for Banchero and 215 for Williams.</p><p>Nobody knows Holmgren's medicals better than the Thunder, however, and given their record as a front office, I'm inclined to believe them that his fluke injuries don't tell us anything about his health going forward despite any concerns about his thin frame.</p><p>Although Holmgren got the max, the Thunder held the line in other areas. Holmgren did not get a player option like Banchero, and even if he reaches 30% max criteria by winning MVP or Defensive Player of the Year or making an All-NBA team, Holmgren's extension will start at 25% of the cap. By contrast, Banchero could reach the full 30% max, projected at $287 million.</p><p>As Oklahoma City prepares for a financial future that includes a supermax extension struck last week with MVP <a data-player-guid=\"4dcec409-3ff9-2881-2bc3-b4289ce6c36d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278073/shai-gilgeous-alexander\">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a> plus a coming extension for Williams, those wins on the edges could be crucial.

Banchero also received this in his new deal.</p><p>The other negotiating point is a player option, and teams have held the line there since Doncic and Young. <a data-player-guid=\"a2edb458-a371-3fba-ba5a-b24dd2fd2d9e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4594268/anthony-edwards\">Anthony Edwards</a> didn't get one coming off making the All-Star team in his third season.

The No. 1 draft pick in 2022, he made his All-Star debut at age 21 and improved his statistical output last season. An oblique tear in October prevented Banchero from making a run at becoming the first player since Doncic with multiple All-Star appearances in his first three seasons.</p><p>Still, there's a gap between Doncic -- an All-NBA first-team pick in his second and third campaigns -- and Banchero, who has yet to finish in the top 20 in All-NBA voting. (He wasn't eligible last season following the injury.)</p><p>I'm surprised the Magic weren't able to lean on the recent track record to strike a deal without a player option, which could allow Banchero to escalate his salary to the supermax a year earlier, if he qualifies, or potentially become an unrestricted free agent in 2030 near his peak at age 27.</p><p>That follows Orlando giving <a data-player-guid=\"a585c182-99b5-3f9f-97ec-4382128e8e9f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4566434/franz-wagner\">Franz Wagner</a> a max extension last summer, before he'd earned corresponding accolades. Wagner probably would have merited a max offer sheet as a restricted free agent this offseason, though the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets\">Brooklyn Nets</a> were the only team that could plausibly make such an offer.</p><p>In the wake of Banchero joining No. 3 pick <a data-player-guid=\"177499ed-dca9-30ab-b6b2-d4162549fd6a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432639/jabari-smith-jr\">Jabari Smith Jr.</a> as the second player drafted in the 2022 first round to strike an extension, it's worth watching the Thunder's duo of Holmgren (drafted between Banchero and Smith) and Williams. No. 12 pick Williams is the other All-Star from the 2022 draft, and his play as Oklahoma City won the NBA championship gives him a strong case for a player option on his own max deal.</p><hr><h2>July 2: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45649142/lakers-reach-agreement-center-deandre-ayton\">Ayton agrees to deal with Lakers</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> agreed to a reported two-year contract with center <a data-player-guid=\"9af41ea8-a24c-025f-a63f-8263fbf0ca66\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278129/deandre-ayton\">Deandre Ayton</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/lal.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade: </strong>B+</p><p>After agreeing to a buyout with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a>, Ayton seemed like a fit for the Lakers, and not just because of the symmetry of pairing the No. 1 pick of the 2018 draft with No. 3 pick <a data-player-guid=\"583794eb-0f38-9bbd-3e25-9dd33b7f83b8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic\">Luka Doncic</a>.

Redick's rotation during the opening round of the playoffs. Hayes did not reach 10 minutes in any game against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"13f727cb-254d-b484-a337-93fcc0047add\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> and was a DNP-CD in the deciding Game 5.</p><p>Ayton was one of the NBA's most prolific pick-and-roll finishers during his time with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6eade89-5971-0e84-8ccb-cd91482b2b50\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a>, ranking third in points scored as a screen setter in both 2021-22 and 2022-23, according to GeniusIQ tracking. Ayton hasn't been nearly as effective running pick-and-roll with the Blazers' ball handlers and weaker spacing the past two seasons, shooting just 58% on resulting shot attempts as compared to 62% over his last three years in Phoenix.</p><p>Although Ayton is only a marginal upgrade over Hayes as a rim protector, his superior size makes Ayton a better defensive rebounder. That should keep Ayton on the court against playoff-caliber opposition.</p><p>By splitting the non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Ayton and <a data-player-guid=\"a2ffece1-7bf0-3c54-aa59-b150b6ecd315\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4592691/jake-laravia\">Jake LaRavia</a>, the Lakers have gone from five players Redick trusted during the playoffs -- a group that included <a data-player-guid=\"e05f4c3a-a0a6-e87f-d752-a5c092b7f474\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2578185/dorian-finney-smith\">Dorian Finney-Smith</a>, who left for the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"78113ad4-1ac7-0c04-dada-388a6ff4e15e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets</a> as an unrestricted free agent -- to hopefully six.

If the Lakers keep 14 players on their roster and waive <a data-player-guid=\"6575a351-3a38-c256-f17d-4f2aa62ad2ce\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3915195/shake-milton\">Shake Milton</a>, whose $3 million salary is non-guaranteed, they can add about $5 million in salary via trade or the biannual exception.</p><p>Depending on what James thinks of Ayton, those moves might not be sufficient to convince him the Lakers have built a championship-caliber roster after losing in the first round. The Lakers have their 2031 first-round pick or potential swaps in 2026, 2028, 2030 and 2032 that could turn the expiring contracts of <a data-player-guid=\"d06ad722-26ff-5865-1433-061e2e6fbb32\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2960236/maxi-kleber\">Maxi Kleber</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"82247bd5-fd40-3926-f54f-af0cc016aa37\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3137259/gabe-vincent\">Gabe Vincent</a> into significant contributors -- the kind of win-now move James would surely prefer they make in his age-41 season.</p><p>Without knowing exactly what's on the table for the Lakers, I think signing Ayton is the right call for now. He increases their playoff ceiling if accepting a buyout from Portland and signing for a small fraction of his previous max salary gets Ayton to buy in to a degree we haven't seen since he helped the Suns to the 2021 Finals.</p><p>Meanwhile, waiting will give the Lakers more information about what they need and who might become available by the trade deadline. If the Lakers put their unprotected pick and swaps on the table, they should be able to add a starting-caliber player at that point.</p><p>Of course, I'm not the person the Lakers need to convince. Nor is James, no matter how many statements he and agent Rich Paul release. The real pivot point for the Lakers' offseason will be Doncic's decision on signing an extension ahead of what could be the final season of his contract. Doncic is eligible for an extension starting Aug. 2, and that's when we'll really be able to grade the Lakers.</p><hr><h2>July 2: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45647470/sources-hornets-free-agent-spencer-dinwiddie-reach-deal\">Hornets retain Mann, add guard depth with Dinwiddie</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"377633c2-0dd1-91a1-83c0-9ed2d0c00ea1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets\">Charlotte Hornets</a> agreed to re-sign guard <a data-player-guid=\"9c80056b-c667-30bd-89d0-d905425b1d1c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432819/tre-mann\">Tre Mann</a> to a reported three-year, $24 million deal; agreed to a reported one-year deal with guard <a data-player-guid=\"d161d7b2-bf15-4c50-b638-0c8d8754efe4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2580782/spencer-dinwiddie\">Spencer Dinwiddie</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/cha.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grades</strong></p><p><strong>Mann:</strong> B-<br>\n<strong>Dinwiddie:</strong> B</p><p>When the Hornets acquired <a data-player-guid=\"2a6515dd-6770-7eac-2141-de08448a6905\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277811/collin-sexton\">Collin Sexton</a> from the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77cea2fb-1388-b7c8-d171-2e72b3aecbfb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/utah/utah-jazz\">Utah Jazz</a> on Sunday, I wrote that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45518013/nba-trade-grades-2025-26-breaking-most-impactful-offseason-deals\">Sexton's addition addressed a Charlotte need for playmaking</a> with <a data-player-guid=\"ffef74e7-7cb4-3cb6-8fc3-4f01ac97fd39\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432816/lamelo-ball\">LaMelo Ball</a> on the bench. After bringing back Mann and adding Dinwiddie, the Hornets appear insistent on ensuring that issue never comes up this season.</p><p>A season-ending injury to Mann in November was a big factor in that weakness. In 13 games before experiencing disc irritation that eventually required surgery, Mann averaged 14.1 PPG in just 24.5 MPG off the bench. That was fueled in part by 40% 3-point shooting, which Charlotte can't necessarily expect to continue. Mann has shot 35% over his four-year career.</p><p>Despite that quibble, there's reason to believe Mann can carve out a key role as a bench scorer.

Bigger in part as the biggest waive and stretch in NBA history involving <a data-player-guid=\"c6bdd0b0-2176-2089-9b41-1ca3540f64f4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6606/damian-lillard\">Damian Lillard</a>, whose entire $112.6 million extension that begins today will be stretched over five seasons, sitting on Milwaukee's cap sheet for $22.5 million through 2029-30.</p><p>That move alone isn't enough to create the cap room necessary for the Bucks to sign Turner to this deal. Milwaukee subsequently agreed to a trade sending <a data-player-guid=\"d87adcb4-8736-4ba7-a188-250127546a89\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2578239/pat-connaughton\">Pat Connaughton</a> to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"377633c2-0dd1-91a1-83c0-9ed2d0c00ea1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets\">Charlotte Hornets</a> with draft picks for <a data-player-guid=\"56ea0e73-183f-d714-e6e2-3469ae9cf76e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102532/vasilije-micic\">Vasilije Micic</a>. If Milwaukee can agree to a buyout with Micic, whose interest in returning to Europe was reported during last season, that should make up the difference.</p><p>In many ways, Turner is like a younger version of Lopez, whose signing helped kick-start this era of Bucks contention. Having a center who can both protect the rim and take that responsibility off Antetokounmpo's plate and stretch the floor for him on offense is the ideal scenario for Milwaukee. Besides Lopez, who is 37, the only other center in free agency who fills both of those roles is <a data-player-guid=\"b79dd16a-5d4b-d704-9b0c-eaa9ec3df217\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3213/al-horford\">Al Horford</a> -- who is two years <i>older</i> than Lopez.</p><p>That made Turner, 29, the only real option for the Bucks to pair with Antetokounmpo through the rest of what they hope will be the remainder of his prime spent in Milwaukee. Turner is coming off the best 3-point season of his career, having averaged 2.2 per game at a 40% clip, and his career 36% accuracy is a tad better than what Lopez shot over his entire seven seasons with the Bucks.</p><p>Turner's defensive upside isn't quite as high as Lopez's. He topped out at fifth in Defensive Player of the Year voting, where Lopez was second in 2022-23. But Turner was often asked to serve as the only rim protector for the Pacers before <a data-player-guid=\"7c82adbb-96d7-2454-2921-535f8b8f6248\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3149673/pascal-siakam\">Pascal Siakam</a>'s arrival. He has never played with a secondary defender as strong as Antetokounmpo. And opponents shot slightly better against the slowing Lopez inside five feet last year, <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*200&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT\">per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats</a>, than they did against Turner.</p><p>Certainly, the contrast between Lopez and Turner was on full display when the two centers met in the first round of the playoffs. Turner averaged 16.8 PPG and 2.2 BPG as Indiana won the series in five games, part of a strong postseason run. Lopez totaled just eight points and one block in the final three games against the Pacers, yielding his starting job to backup <a data-player-guid=\"2f914525-c16f-def6-42db-f2a4c1d27502\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064482/bobby-portis\">Bobby Portis</a> for what proved to be Lopez's final game in Milwaukee.</p><p>That said, Lopez wasn't the only reason, or even the primary reason, the Bucks lost that series. Their starting wing duo of <a data-player-guid=\"6fe27ee9-be2b-9ddd-d75f-18675e177915\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3134907/kyle-kuzma\">Kyle Kuzma</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"bb4c77ff-39aa-4d30-47a4-a1e375f721d1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990962/taurean-prince\">Taurean Prince</a> was invisible against Indiana, combining for 35 points on 14-of-45 shooting. Milwaukee hasn't yet done anything to address that weakness.</p><p>If the Bucks are as serious about contending as this move suggests, it's imperative that they use their remaining draft assets (an unprotected 2032 first-round pick, plus a swap in 2031 or re-swapping picks that either the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9461f397-7882-94c0-c18c-e89bdc9e570e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans Pelicans</a> or <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ed294c02-3c44-db14-9e06-1b4e8cff9558\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers\">Portland Trail Blazers</a> can swap) to upgrade from Kuzma. <a data-player-guid=\"52d9a7a4-0bee-a926-a5fd-f2ecb96eaa95\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3138196/cameron-johnson\">Cam Johnson</a>, perhaps the cleanest replacement, is already off the board after a trade agreed to Monday sent him to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c4aceb39-0eb9-a30b-1120-9cb5b12b677a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a>.</p><p>Failing that, while I credit Milwaukee for creativity and boldness of this move, I'm not sure the Bucks are much closer to championship contention. Waiving Lillard takes away the upside of him potentially returning from an Achilles rupture in the playoffs to play at a high level. Turner, the third option at best in the Pacers' offense, is now the only player besides Antetokounmpo on the roster who averaged even 15 points last season.</p><p>If Antetokounmpo decides at some point he's ready to move on from Milwaukee, the good news is Turner should have more trade value on this contract than Lillard would have making the max. The downside is the Bucks' eventual rebuild will be saddled by not controlling their own draft picks and by the cap hit for the Lillard stretch. Milwaukee might not be able to stretch players making appreciable salary for the next five years because of the CBA rule that limits teams to 15% of the current cap as dead salary after a stretch is completed.</p><p>The news is worse for the Pacers, who lost a key contributor to their Finals run in his late prime. Indiana should now be able to use the full $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel to replace Turner without pushing into the luxury tax, whereas matching this offer to Turner would have required the Pacers to trade one of their rotation players to avoid the tax.</p><p>Still, if ever there was a time for a small-market team like Indiana to pay the tax, it's coming off getting within one win of a championship. <a data-player-guid=\"c4a0ba92-4e50-60af-a617-3345255115a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396993/tyrese-haliburton\">Tyrese Haliburton</a>'s Achilles rupture in Game 7 of the NBA Finals changes expectations for the Pacers next season, but Turner would have remained a valuable starter beyond Haliburton's return to full strength in 2026-27.</p><p>Already, center depth was one of Indiana's biggest needs after two backups (<a data-player-guid=\"4df234c9-e02d-3a02-8e36-9955ff214fa1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432170/isaiah-jackson\">Isaiah Jackson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432808/james-wiseman\">James Wiseman</a>) suffered Achilles ruptures during the 2024-25 regular season.

The situation is dramatically different now, meaning the only question was whether Gilgeous-Alexander would sign the supermax this summer or wait until next year when he could have added a fifth year to his contract.</p><p>In an ideal world, Gilgeous-Alexander might have taken slightly less than the full 35% of the cap that a supermax extension allows as a starting point. (The actual value of the contract, currently projected at $285 million by ESPN's Bobby Marks, won't be known until the salary cap is set for the 2027-28 season.)</p><p>Gilgeous-Alexander has earned every penny of the supermax, certainly, and Oklahoma City is more prepared than any team in NBA history has been for its stars to get raises.

And the unprecedented stockpile of first-round picks Oklahoma City accumulated during its rebuild means the team will continue incorporating cheaper contributors to replace parts of the 2025 champions and stay in contention throughout Gilgeous-Alexander's prime years.</p><hr><h2>July 1: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/contributor/shams-charania/31111a772dd3d\">Bucks land deals with Harris, Sims</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f59bbabc-eedb-9ad2-c5dd-9bcd9f450a2f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mil/milwaukee-bucks\">Milwaukee Bucks</a> agreed to a reported two-year deal with guard <a data-player-guid=\"80977674-266a-5c4a-16a5-f7efe9961fe0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2999547/gary-harris\">Gary Harris</a>; agreed to a reported two-year deal with center <a data-player-guid=\"a1f01b18-9446-26a2-5f12-cff33c2784f1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277922/jericho-sims\">Jericho Sims</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/mil.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grades</strong></p><p><strong>Harris grade:</strong> C<br>\n<strong>Sims grade</strong>: B-</p><p>After Tuesday's stunning pair of moves -- waiving <a data-player-guid=\"c6bdd0b0-2176-2089-9b41-1ca3540f64f4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6606/damian-lillard\">Damian Lillard</a> and stretching his salary to make room to sign center <a data-player-guid=\"a61d70b4-d544-33c8-3eb9-aa6e5074f97e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3133628/myles-turner\">Myles Turner</a> -- the Bucks continued filling out their roster later in the day.</p><p>At this point, Harris is a bigger name than he is as a contributor.

Toronto re-signed Poeltl to a four-year, $78 million contract the following summer and is now giving him nearly the largest possible raise off that contract.</p><p>Technically, Poeltl could have added $88.5 million on a three-year extension after exercising a $19.5 million player option for 2026-27. This deal pays him nearly but not quite that amount, adding $84.5 million in new money for the total of $104 million after this season.</p><p>The Raptors can point to Poeltl's adjusted plus-minus impact as evidence of his value. According to xRAPM, from the co-creator of ESPN's Real Plus-Minus (Jerry Engelmann), Poeltl rates 2.2 points per 100 possessions better than league average, <a href=\"https://xrapm.com/\">putting him in the 89th percentile leaguewide</a>.</p><p>There are two problems with applying that rating to Poeltl's extension. The first is it's unlikely the rest of the league values Poeltl as highly, so it's certainly possible Toronto could have gotten him back as an unrestricted free agent next summer (or in 2027) for less money and it's unlikely the Raptors would have been outbid.</p><p>The second concern is how Poeltl will age. He'll be 32 when this extension kicks in for the 2027-28 season and 34 by the end of it. Already, Poeltl's rim protection hasn't rated as well since rejoining Toronto as it did with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8aef8547-32f5-0943-a1de-e734567674cc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs\">San Antonio Spurs</a>. Opponents have hit better than 60% of attempts inside the restricted area with Poeltl as the primary defender over the past three seasons, per GeniusIQ tracking, as compared to 53.5% in 2020-21 and 56% in 2021-22.</p><p>From a bigger-picture standpoint, the Raptors continue to invest in a core that hasn't yet proved capable of making the playoffs. Poeltl gives Toronto four starters under contract for a combined $145 million in 2027-28, and granting that one of them (<a data-player-guid=\"735792ca-bca3-6bab-e2ed-68f39ccc7270\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3913176/brandon-ingram\">Brandon Ingram</a>, acquired at the trade deadline) has yet to make his Raptors debut, it's far from clear that this group is good enough to contend in the East.</p><p>Given that context and the lack of urgency to extend Poeltl, I would have waited. This exact deal would not have been possible once the season started, but if Poeltl was willing to exercise his player option, Toronto could have executed an identical contract before the start of free agency next summer. In signing a deal that won't kick in for two years, I think the Raptors are taking on too much risk for too little reward.</p><p>I'm much higher on the Mamukelashvili signing. He averaged 20.4 points per 36 minutes for the Spurs last season, including a 34-point outburst on 13-of-14 shooting against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"61719eb2-11c3-4e3d-90c3-0a1319fd850b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks</a> in March. Mamukelashvili shooting 37% on a reasonable sample of 3-point attempts (161) was encouraging, since he has long been accurate inside the arc.</p><p>If Mamukelashvili can shoot, I particularly like the idea of pairing him with either <a data-player-guid=\"6c480e2e-1fcf-32b6-be64-f0cf43c4f2c5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5107897/jonathan-mogbo\">Jonathan Mogbo</a> or <a data-player-guid=\"8cca71b9-6ade-316f-9b13-a2486e0dbd46\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5093267/collin-murray-boyles\">Collin Murray-Boyles</a> in second-unit frontcourts.

The 64-win <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ec79ad1f-e6d2-7762-a2db-7fe97d35126b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> were one spot behind the Kings, while the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"083a58a6-b849-3501-e67b-059290d12295\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a> (who went 19-9 after the break) were one spot ahead. Overall, Sacramento's 12th-ranked offense after the break was less of a factor in the team's 12-15 finish to end up in the play-in than rating 22nd in defensive rating over that span.</p><p>To some degree, Schroder could help there. He's capable of providing full-court pressure on opposing ball handlers. Still, the 6-foot-1 Schroder makes the Kings even smaller on the perimeter, and he's certainly a downgrade defensively as compared to Ellis.</p><p>Offensively, Schroder has always been better cast as a playmaker off the bench than as a starter. His value has fluctuated in large part with his 3-point percentage. Schroder shot 38.5% during 2019-20, when he averaged 18.9 points and finished second in Sixth Man of the Year voting, but he hasn't reached that height over a full season while playing for seven teams in five years -- not counting two separate stints with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>.</p><p>Schroder was at his best starting last season with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets\">Brooklyn Nets</a>, where he hit 39% of 3s and averaged 18.4 points and 6.6 rebounds.

Based on Jackson's existing $23.4 million salary in the final season of his contract, the Grizzlies could add a maximum of $147 million over four years on an extension after he fell short of qualifying for a supermax extension as a player with All-NBA honors. (Jackson was 17th in the voting, 13 points shy of making the third team.)</p><p>Using cap space to renegotiate Jackson's 2025-26 salary upward allowed Memphis to make a more competitive extension offer. This structure presumably adds $10 million to Jackson's current contract, allowing his starting salary to bump up to $46 million or so in 2026-27. That's still shy of the max Jackson could have made as an unrestricted free agent next summer ($50 million, based on the NBA's updated projection of a 7% cap increase), but getting more money now helps make up that difference.</p><p>All told, Jackson is adding $217 million in new money, as compared to the projected $219 million other teams could have offered on a four-max in 2026 free agency. Locking in the security of a massive deal now in a place Jackson wants to play is probably worth the modest difference.</p><p>From the Grizzlies' perspective, this is still a huge win. They take the potential of Jackson leaving in free agency off the table, as well as the possibility of him qualifying for the supermax by making All-NBA next season. Creating cap space by moving <a data-player-guid=\"f5096a5b-cbc5-1d7f-d406-56c623c434e5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990992/marcus-smart\">Marcus Smart</a> for expiring contracts at the trade deadline did cost Memphis a first-round pick, but I'd say that gamble paid off.</p><p>Technically, the Grizzlies don't yet have the cap room necessary to complete this deal. ESPN's Shams Charania reported that Memphis does not need to make a trade, suggesting the team will waive players and stretch its salary if no deal materializes before then. Doing so with reserve forward <a data-player-guid=\"d4c8df92-1ba0-32dc-7329-fd611c2cd134\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3134932/john-konchar\">John Konchar</a> wouldn't create quite enough space, so the Grizzlies are probably looking at letting newly acquired guard <a data-player-guid=\"390cbbeb-9761-1174-69a8-831a5b201127\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432809/cole-anthony\">Cole Anthony</a> go. If stretched, Anthony would count $5.2 million against Memphis' cap through 2029-30.</p><p>Trading a player or stretching their salary is necessary to allow the Grizzlies to retain full Bird rights for Aldama, who averaged career highs in points (12.5), rebounds (6.4) and assists (2.9) per game in the final season of his rookie contract. Still just 24, Aldama figures to remain a key part of Memphis' rotation through the life of his contract.</p><p>Given the limited amount of cap space available this summer and Aldama's modest qualifying offer ($5.9 million), it's possible the Grizzlies could have squeezed him more on this deal. Aldama will make far more than the $44 million that is the most other teams could have offered over this span using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception.</p><p>The upside for Memphis is getting to structure Aldama's contract in a favorable manner. I'd guess his contract will start at its highest point before descending, allowing the Grizzlies to stuff as much salary as possible on their books for this season. Memphis is nowhere near the luxury-tax line and has plenty of flexibility to use its $8.8 million room exception to add a contributor.

With Lillard expected to miss all of 2025-26 after an Achilles rupture, Porter projects as Milwaukee's starting point guard.</p><p>Porter's talent is unquestionable. He played last season at the minimum after spending 2023-24 out of the league following <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39369886/kevin-porter-jr-reaches-plea-deal-assault-harassment-charges\">a plea deal on assault and harassment charges</a> stemming from a September 2023 incident.</p><p>Porter had struggled to score efficiently before landing with the Bucks at the trade deadline in February. His 41% 3-point shooting the rest of the way isn't likely sustainable, but his career-best 53% accuracy inside the arc might be legit. Milwaukee using the biannual exception for his deal was a necessary part of the team's offseason plans.</p><p>Like Porter, Trent was important in the Bucks' first-round series with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"547fc042-3e02-4795-9637-9ab84322b625\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-pacers\">Indiana Pacers</a>, topping 30 points twice in five games. For Milwaukee to get Trent back using non-Bird rights (a 20% raise off his minimum salary) is a huge win. Trent, meanwhile, will establish early Bird rights if he declines a 2026-27 player option.</p><p>Prince was one of the noncontributors pushed out of the rotation against Indiana. After starting 73 games during the regular season, Prince played just 22 minutes over the last three games of the series after scoring a combined six points in Games 1 and 2. In that context, I'm a little surprised Prince earned a two-year deal with a player option. That means he'll count on the cap at his actual $3.3 million salary rather than the $2.3 million veteran's minimum.</p><p>From a bigger-picture standpoint, the question is where the Bucks are heading by bringing back their 2025 playoff rotation minus departed <a data-player-guid=\"3496fbc1-fa88-c332-7f91-f015006e0c8b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez\">Brook Lopez</a>.

But none of this makes up for the loss of Lillard, let alone improves on a Bucks team that hasn't won a playoff series since 2022.</p><p>There are still opportunities for Milwaukee to make trades.

Advanced metrics have consistently shown Kornet making a major impact with his rim protection and high-percentage finishing.</p><p>Since taking the 3-pointer out of his game, Kornet has shot 68% over the past three seasons. Meanwhile, as Kram highlighted, opponents shot just 52% against Kornet within 5 feet, <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*100&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT\">according to GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats</a>, putting him in the top 10 alongside Wembanyama among players who defended at least 100 such attempts.</p><p>Adding Kornet addresses San Antonio's biggest weakness last season: defending with Wembanyama on the bench. The Spurs' defensive rating ranked in the 73rd percentile with Wembanyama on the court and dropped to the 9th percentile without him. Improving that weakness is the fastest way for San Antonio to reach the playoffs.</p><p>Beyond that, I suspect Kornet should play with Wembanyama at times, too. The Spurs ditched playing Wembanyama as a power forward last season after they struggled with him next to <a data-player-guid=\"c68386fb-23ff-62e4-b2b0-3f8843a3f35c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066650/zach-collins\">Zach Collins</a> as a rookie. Per my analysis of lineup data from NBA Advanced Stats, Wembanyama played exclusively at center in 2024-25.</p><p>Still, I think it's worth revisiting with a better center option and more shot creation around them. Double-big lineups were effective for several teams last season and are worth exploring for San Antonio.</p><p>Even if Kornet is strictly a backup center, I'd rather have him on this deal than nearly all the older big men who agreed to similar contracts Monday or the more defensively challenged players who re-signed over the weekend (<a data-player-guid=\"2f914525-c16f-def6-42db-f2a4c1d27502\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064482/bobby-portis\">Bobby Portis</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"f8d497e7-586c-2aa7-4da1-3af638ca26e1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396971/naz-reid\">Naz Reid</a>).

However, Missi and Matkovic showed progress, and at the respective ages of 21 and 24, they figure to improve.</p><p>Now, the Pelicans have spent much of their limited resources addressing center without finding a clear upgrade. Looney is a reliable veteran with championship experience, but he averaged just 15 minutes per game last season for the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a>.

It was unlikely the Pelicans would push into the tax anyway, having never before paid it, but that leaves them with just $5 million in wiggle room to fill a remaining roster spot and make moves during the season. For the right addition, that restriction would have made sense.

Finney-Smith, a 38% 3-point shooter over the past six seasons who hit 41% beyond the arc last season, provides more of that than Brooks. Although Brooks shot a career-high 40% on 3s in 2024-25, he's at 35.5% for his career.</p><p>There is some risk here that a four-year contract for Finney-Smith becomes a negative value by the end.

Still, locking in more guaranteed money helps explain why Finney-Smith declined a 2025-26 player option for $15.4 million that would have paid more than his new average salary.</p><p>On the plus side, the Rockets getting Finney-Smith for less than the entire value of the non-taxpayer midlevel exception could make it easier for them to avoid paying the luxury tax this season. If Finney-Smith's contract features 5% raises, Houston should end up about $3 million over the tax line, meaning moving <a data-player-guid=\"292da727-7e6e-3764-962c-e35a60cf1f12\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5105592/cam-whitmore\">Cam Whitmore</a> or multiple minimum contracts midseason could allow the Rockets to dodge the tax.</p><p>Whether Houston pays the tax is trivial this year but could have important implications down the road in terms of starting the clock on the repeater tax.</p><p>For now, adding Finney-Smith gives the Rockets a rock-solid top seven that also includes forwards <a data-player-guid=\"177499ed-dca9-30ab-b6b2-d4162549fd6a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432639/jabari-smith-jr\">Jabari Smith Jr</a>.

Subsequently, LaRavia enjoyed the best season of his career, shooting 42% on 3-pointers and boosting his true shooting percentage from .538 his first two years to .591.</p><p>Although the Grizzlies traded LaRavia to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e266c4ea-9af3-1bd8-06fb-fd608fd30e26\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings\">Sacramento Kings</a> at the deadline, the declined option continued to restrict the Kings' ability to re-sign him. Sacramento was able to offer a maximum of $5.6 million, the value of that option, to LaRavia this season. The Lakers more or less matched that salary on a two-year deal.</p><p>For the Lakers, the best part of adding LaRavia is his age. At 23, he is still coming into his own as a contributor; and if this is a straight two-year deal, the Lakers would be able to re-sign him using early Bird rights in the summer of 2027, when he'll be 25.</p><p>Based on LaRavia's age and production, my SCHOENE projection system has him forecast just outside the top 20 free agents. If that's remotely accurate, $6 million per year should be a bargain. Because LaRavia's contract is too big for the biannual exception, it likely will have to come out of the Lakers' $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception. That leaves the Lakers with about $8 million to spend, most likely on a center.</p><p>Splitting the midlevel would help the Lakers' depth more than committing it all to a single player, which would leave them with the same number of reliable rotation players after seeing <a data-player-guid=\"e05f4c3a-a0a6-e87f-d752-a5c092b7f474\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2578185/dorian-finney-smith\">Dorian Finney-Smith</a> strike an agreement with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"78113ad4-1ac7-0c04-dada-388a6ff4e15e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets</a> earlier Monday.</p><hr><h2>June 30: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45622532/sources-mavs-agree-13m-deal-pg-dangelo-russell\">Mavs fill PG need with Russell deal</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f00d1f4e-4ce6-d581-466c-5b52531cf7ad\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks</a> agreed to a reported two-year, $13 million contract with guard <a data-player-guid=\"155978bc-3f36-925f-c5b2-b0f15c5a2a13\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136776/dangelo-russell\">D'Angelo Russell</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/dal.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade</strong>: B+</p><p>From a value standpoint, it's hard to argue this move. Russell made an average of $18 million over the past two seasons and was on a max deal before that. Russell actually will make less in 2025-26 on this contract, which utilizes the taxpayer midlevel exception, than he did in the last year of his rookie deal.</p><p>Of course, Russell's salary trending the wrong direction also reflects the difficulty of finding the right fit for his skill set. Russell is a high-volume shot creator (24% usage last season) who only scored with high efficiency during two seasons with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>. Russell isn't effective playing primarily off the ball and no longer fits on a rebuilding team at age 29.</p><p>All of that made Dallas an ideal destination. The Mavericks sputtered in the play-in tournament in part because they lacked an initiator with <a data-player-guid=\"4fb2e3fc-ad79-d9bc-ddd9-bbb09f29ead3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving\">Kyrie Irving</a> sidelined after a left ACL tear that should keep him out much of the 2025-26 campaign. Dallas started lineups with no true point guard down the stretch, relying on forward <a data-player-guid=\"cdbdcd50-106b-aad8-204e-49201a429b51\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278594/naji-marshall\">Naji Marshall</a> to bring up the ball.</p><p>The Mavericks certainly weren't going to do better in terms of pedigree than Russell, armed only with their taxpayer midlevel. (To even utilize that, Dallas had to agree to a multiyear deal with Irving that pays him less than a player option would have for 2025-26.) If the Mavericks catch Russell on one of the hot stretches he enjoyed with the Lakers, this could prove an enormous bargain.</p><p>At the same time, there's always an expiration date with Russell. His limitations were exposed during two playoff runs with the Lakers, as Russell shot just 31% on 3s and was targeted defensively. The ideal scenario for Dallas is probably Russell carrying the team through the regular season before Irving returns in time for a playoff run.</p><p>If Russell is able to rebuild his value, he'll likely decline a 2026-27 player option in favor of a stronger market in free agency while the Mavs move forward with Irving. So, there's a chance this is a mutually beneficial short-term marriage.</p><hr><h2>June 30: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45619586/sources-nicolas-batum-returning-clippers-opt-out\">Clippers re-sign Batum to two-year deal</a></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"083a58a6-b849-3501-e67b-059290d12295\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a> agreed to re-sign forward <a data-player-guid=\"e83378ef-622a-a884-12bb-86482f9a84d2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3416/nicolas-batum\">Nicolas Batum</a> to a reported two-year, $11.5 million deal</em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/lac.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade:</strong> A</p><p>Both sides got a little something out of Batum declining his $4.9 million player option in favor of re-signing with the Clippers.

Per ESPN's Shams Charania, the player option is partially guaranteed, making the second season something of a mutual option.</p><p>To make that legal, Harden's 2025-26 salary must be guaranteed for the same percentage. Presumably, that salary will fully guarantee days or weeks after the contract is signed, similar to the deal J.R. Smith signed with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ec79ad1f-e6d2-7762-a2db-7fe97d35126b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> in September 2015. The player option also gives Harden the right to approve any trade this season.</p><p>As with Smith, who declined his option after the Cavaliers won the 2016 title, the partial guarantee probably won't ultimately matter. Assuming Harden stays healthy and plays well during his age-36 season, either the Clippers will guarantee his 2026-27 salary or Harden will decline the player option and head into free agency next summer when more teams have cap space.

He could fill the open spot in the starting lineup or get squeezed if Houston adds another forward in free agency. Either way, at 22, Smith is an important part of the Rockets' post-Durant future. We've yet to see Smith prove to be the kind of shot creator in the NBA that he was during the single season at Auburn which made him the No. 3 pick by Houston. In fact, his usage rate has dropped all three seasons to a career-low 16%. But Smith's combination of ability to space the floor (36% from 3-point range on almost six attempts per 36 minutes) and defensive versatility at 6-foot-11 gives him a floor of key rotation player on a contender.</p><p>The upside scenario is Smith continues his development and makes this contract a bargain for the Rockets.

Minnesota figures to start the season paying $20-30 million in taxes, with the ability to reduce that by trading away players at the end of the roster midseason.</p><p>Compared to the Reid contract, I like the value better here for the Timberwolves. Randle is a two-time All-Star who played at that level over the first two rounds of the playoffs before a disappointing series against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"bd458c44-2d33-47eb-cebc-35d3d4ac595c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder\">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> in the conference finals. Randle didn't likely have a market at this level in free agency this summer but could have done better a year from now when many more teams will have cap space.</p><p>Making this a new contract rather than an extension allows the two sides to wipe out the incentives in Randle's current contract, meaning he's assured his full cap hit and unlikely incentives no longer affect Minnesota with regard to the luxury-tax apron.</p><hr><h2><strong>June 29: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45608010/lebron-james-picks-526m-option-monitoring-lakers-moves\">LeBron picks up $52.6M option</a></strong></h2><ul><li><p><em><a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a> forward <a data-player-guid=\"1f6592b3-ff53-d321-8dc5-6038d48c1786\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> exercises $52.6 million player option</em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/lal.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade:</strong> N/A</p><p>At surface level, the explanation from ESPN's Shams Charania that James is exercising his 2025-26 player option while simultaneously contemplating his future with the Lakers is difficult to understand. If James might want to play elsewhere, why not become a free agent?</p><p>Because this year's market is largely devoid of cap space, the rebuilding <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets\">Brooklyn Nets</a> are the only team that could offer James anything approaching his $54.1 million max salary as a free agent. If James is somehow to change teams this summer, it will almost certainly be by trade.</p><p>A sign-and-trade would be possible if James were to decline his option, but that possibility is complicated by the fact that a team receiving a player via sign-and-trade is automatically hard-capped at the lower luxury-tax apron, limiting its moves to build out the roster. An opt-in and trade isn't subject to the same restrictions.</p><p>For example, hypothetically the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> could now trade <a data-player-guid=\"076edf90-d167-2d15-88cb-a174c984b9e3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler-iii\">Jimmy Butler III</a> (starting a max extension) to the Lakers for James and <a data-player-guid=\"456f71fd-2ce5-3f50-8d0d-f30c0159789d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683774/bronny-james\">Bronny James</a> and neither team would face a hard cap of any kind, allowing the Warriors to re-sign restricted free agent <a data-player-guid=\"fa4aeb82-1488-3163-b374-4e0cdd9cb23a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433247/jonathan-kuminga\">Jonathan Kuminga</a>.</p><p>Setting James' cap number does clarify the Lakers' options in free agency. Essentially, the team will be choosing between re-signing forward <a data-player-guid=\"e05f4c3a-a0a6-e87f-d752-a5c092b7f474\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2578185/dorian-finney-smith\">Dorian Finney-Smith</a> (who plans to decline a $15.4 million player option in favor of a longer contract, per Charania) and using the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception, presumably on a starting center.

Instead, he'll sign a new contract that should pay him a similar amount this season with two additional years at $30-plus million.</p><p>I'm surprised the market was that high on Portis, who was a finalist for the Sixth Man award in both 2022-23 and 2023-24 but has never rated that well by advanced stats. Portis was not nearly as efficient a scorer last season, when his accuracy on both 2s (51%) and 3s (36.5%) was his lowest since signing with Milwaukee in 2020. Additionally, Portis missed nearly the entire second half due to a 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy.</p><p>To Portis' credit, he became coach Doc Rivers' most trusted option at center by the end of the Bucks' first-round loss to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"547fc042-3e02-4795-9637-9ab84322b625\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-pacers\">Indiana Pacers</a>. Portis played 44 minutes in Game 5, which went to overtime, and had a double-double of 14 points (albeit on 6-of-18 shooting) and 10 rebounds. With <a data-player-guid=\"3496fbc1-fa88-c332-7f91-f015006e0c8b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez\">Brook Lopez</a> an unrestricted free agent, Portis could be Milwaukee's starting center next year.</p><p>Though Portis' contract would be on the cheap side for a veteran starter, I suspect playing that role would expose him defensively. Opponents shot 69% on attempts inside 5 feet with Portis as a primary defender, <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*3:GP*GE*10&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT\">per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats</a>, putting him in the bottom 25 among all players who defended at least three such shots per game. By contrast, opponents hit just 59% of those attempts against Lopez.</p><p>I'm also skeptical of how well Portis will hold his value over the life of this contract. He turned 30 in February and will be 33 by the final season of the deal, another player option. The quickness that has been a strength for Portis when defended by centers might not remain an advantage much longer.</p><p>Every dollar counts for the Bucks, who are $27.5 million below the first luxury tax apron with nine players under contract, including non-guaranteed salaries for <a data-player-guid=\"e467715b-6501-c7d0-4eaf-1a91d75e7979\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397475/aj-green\">AJ Green</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"82f7dd16-13fe-34d4-a89e-8f21c68f150c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432190/andre-jackson-jr\">Andre Jackson Jr</a>. and <a data-player-guid=\"3abc536f-365a-3780-8b1e-3b758ad20c98\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433622/chris-livingston\">Chris Livingston</a>.

This deal starts around $8.5 million with maximum 8% raises, putting it around the value of the room midlevel exception and far less than the non-taxpayer midlevel exception that could be Jerome's market.</p><p>Going out four years with Merrill could have some risk. Because he was drafted at age 24 after serving a Latter-day Saints mission prior to his career at Utah State, Merrill recently turned 29 and this deal takes him well into his 30s. Merrill's shooting ability is unlikely to wane but his defense might become an issue at some point.</p><p>With Cleveland's second-apron limitations, replacing Merrill would have been difficult, and the team can plan for a two-year window of big spending before retrenching when several contracts expire after the 2026-27 campaign. In that context, signing Merrill for a smaller starting salary but a larger total amount probably made sense for the Cavaliers.</p><hr><h2>June 27: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45599801/naz-reid-sign-5-year-125m-deal-stay-wolves\">Timberwolves and Naz Reid agree to new deal</a></h2><ul><li><p><em>Agreed to a reported five-year, $125 million contract with forward/center <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396971/naz-reid\">Naz Reid</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/min.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade: </strong>C-</p><p>In what looked like a difficult market for free agents, Reid found leverage to get an incredibly favorable contract.</p><p>The Timberwolves now face a challenge to also re-sign starting forward <a data-player-guid=\"cea0d1d3-6353-87c8-929e-c556ae36dc41\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064514/julius-randle\">Julius Randle</a> (who, like Reid, holds a player option for 2025-26) and reserve guard <a data-player-guid=\"a67ef214-b56f-ca43-1558-7b2d13432f63\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278039/nickeil-alexander-walker\">Nickeil Alexander-Walker</a>.

Still, I'm not convinced Reid is a starting-caliber player despite winning the Sixth Man award in 2023-24.</p><p>A bench role suits Reid because of his defensive limitations, which were exposed by playing center more last season after Minnesota traded <a data-player-guid=\"12998df5-b137-fe32-8e90-f3844e8d8ee6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136195/karl-anthony-towns\">Karl-Anthony Towns</a>. Lineups with Reid at center allowed a 116.3 defensive rating last season, <a href=\"https://www.cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/18/lineups?PF=4700#tab-four_factors\">per Cleaning the Glass</a>, as compared to 103.0 when he played power forward. That's worth keeping in mind if you're projecting Reid as <a data-player-guid=\"78795dbf-3e02-934e-f796-d6a71375c9f5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032976/rudy-gobert\">Rudy Gobert</a>'s eventual replacement at center.</p><p>The advent of the second apron, plus steeper penalties for teams with large luxury tax bills, means overpaying key contributors is more costly than ever. Although Reid has been an indispensable part of the Timberwolves teams that have reached the past two conference finals, paying him like a starter is going to force them to sacrifice down the line. Given the market, I think Minnesota should have done better with this contract.</p><hr><h2>June 25: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45582499/sources-fred-vanvleet-plans-sign-new-50m-deal-rockets\">VanVleet to sign new $50 million deal with Houston</a></h2><ul><li><p><em>Agreed to a reported two-year, $50 million contract with guard <a data-player-guid=\"6c6e5179-fc67-908e-bc50-0a5580d64159\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991230/fred-vanvleet\">Fred VanVleet</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/hou.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade:</strong> A</p><p>This deal, which will replace a $44.9 million team option the Rockets held for VanVleet in 2025-26, is some combination of Houston using its leverage well and/or being willing to spend even bigger in the future.</p><p>It's certainly true that VanVleet would have had a tough time beating this offer on the open market. Only the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets\">Brooklyn Nets</a> could even legally do so using cap space, meaning the Rockets' participation in a sign-and-trade would have been necessary for VanVleet to get more than the non-taxpayer midlevel exception to play for a contender as an unrestricted free agent.</p><p>Still, the same will be true for virtually any free agent of note, and it's unlikely other teams will get this kind of bargain. Consider that VanVleet will make less next season than <a data-player-guid=\"4fb2e3fc-ad79-d9bc-ddd9-bbb09f29ead3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving\">Kyrie Irving</a>, who will start the year rehabbing an ACL tear. Yes, Irving had the leverage of a player option for 2025-26 on his contract, but he still added more new money ($76 million over the two years beyond 2025-26) than VanVleet.</p><p>It's possible VanVleet could make up the difference now that he holds a player option for 2026-27. Houston is currently hard-capped at the second luxury-tax apron by virtue of aggregating salaries in the <a data-player-guid=\"dc324fde-eee8-98e2-09ac-d31d8ad9909e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a> trade. That restriction may not exist a year from now, which would allow the Rockets to potentially re-sign VanVleet to a bigger, longer deal in a summer where other teams will have ample cap space to pursue him.</p><p>For the time being, getting VanVleet around $20 million less than his option sets Houston up to have access to its non-taxpayer midlevel exception. In a market where only the Nets will likely have more to offer, that makes the Rockets a player for a big-time free agent to complement Durant and their young core.</p><p><a data-player-guid=\"a67ef214-b56f-ca43-1558-7b2d13432f63\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278039/nickeil-alexander-walker\">Nickeil Alexander-Walker</a> is the most obvious Houston target who would fit into a playoff rotation on the perimeter, having played that role for the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"13f727cb-254d-b484-a337-93fcc0047add\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> in back-to-back conference finals runs. <a data-player-guid=\"a42d9e61-4fca-c73b-afc4-5da0eb14df98\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277843/gary-trent-jr\">Gary Trent Jr</a>.'s shooting is another fit, while <a data-player-guid=\"c3105754-89ce-5055-3b1b-61c45e7ce40a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065733/ty-jerome\">Ty Jerome</a> would be a good value but might be duplicative of what the Rockets hope 2024 No. 3 pick <a data-player-guid=\"b2e3effa-a7ab-3837-8d7e-da8b05577441\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4711272/reed-sheppard\">Reed Sheppard</a> will become.</p><p>Wherever Houston lands, the ability to access the full midlevel should help Houston replace the slight depth lost in the Durant trade and strengthen the Rockets as championship contenders.</p><hr><h2>June 24: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45578603/mavericks-kyrie-irving-declining-player-option-intends-sign-3-year-119-million-contract\">Kyrie Irving declines player option</a></h2><ul><li><p><em>Agreed to a reported three-year, $119 million extension with guard <a data-player-guid=\"4fb2e3fc-ad79-d9bc-ddd9-bbb09f29ead3\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving\">Kyrie Irving</a></em></p></li></ul><p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/dal.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"></strong><strong>Grade:</strong> B+</p><p>Irving had until the end of the day Tuesday to decide on a $43 million player option for 2025-26.

(In practice, the rebuilding Nets bringing Irving back three years after dealing him to Dallas might be politely termed a long shot.)</p><p>At the same time, Irving could have picked up his option and targeted free agency next year, when it's possible he could have gotten a contract worth more annually -- and certainly a longer one. This seems like a fair compromise.</p><p>Reducing Irving's starting salary to around $37 million has important implications for the Mavericks this summer. That leaves them about $7 million from the second luxury-tax apron with 13 players under contract, not counting a team option for backup point guard <a data-player-guid=\"061f1f44-4891-7cf8-99cf-0a7663b8ad19\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397040/brandon-williams\">Brandon Williams</a>.</p><p>Had Irving picked up his option, Dallas would likely have been limited to offering minimum contracts, barring a money-saving trade. Now, the Mavericks could have access to the taxpayer midlevel to sign a ball handler as a free agent and fill the void left by Irving, who will be out much of 2025-26 after suffering an ACL tear in March.</p><hr><h2>June 23: <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45570087/sources-mavericks-extend-gafford-3-year-60m-deal\">Mavs' Gafford gets three-year extension</a></h2><ul><li><p><em>Agreed to a reported three-year extension with center <a data-player-guid=\"5ea1b27c-35dc-c1cf-3d9c-ba22c98062d4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278049/daniel-gafford\">Daniel Gafford</a></em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/dal.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade: </strong>Pass (extensions for non-free agents graded on a pass/fail basis)</p><p>The most interesting element of this extension is the timing. Conventional wisdom had it that Gafford could be a trade candidate this summer, given the Mavericks' crowded depth chart at center, where younger <a data-player-guid=\"a0268e7a-137e-3749-b75c-bedefd1177e4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683688/dereck-lively-ii\">Dereck Lively II</a> is the team's starter of the future and starting power forward <a data-player-guid=\"dcf63163-4dbf-c59d-1920-3ecc2f8bd5fb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis\">Anthony Davis</a> is also capable of -- and perhaps best suited for -- playing the 5.</p><p>There's little question that Gafford merits a raise coming off the best season of his NBA career. Having excelled defensively in a platoon with Lively as Dallas reached the 2024 NBA Finals, Gafford got a chance to play extended minutes between when Lively went down with a stress fracture in his right ankle in January and his own knee sprain in February.</p><p>During 11 full games in that span, Gafford averaged 15.0 PPG on 67% shooting, 10.3 RPG and 3.6 BPG, the last of which would have threatened <a data-player-guid=\"0e8844b2-d923-3926-82d2-f19a29d69490\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama\">Victor Wembanyama</a> (3.8 BPG) for tops in the NBA. Typically just a finisher on offense, Gafford even created in the post with the team battling multiple injuries. His 52 post-ups last season was a career high, per GeniusIQ tracking, although Gafford's efficiency on those plays wasn't especially strong.</p><p>Besides the limitations on Gafford's role with the Mavericks, a trade now also makes sense because this could be the peak of his performance. Gafford will be 27 in October, and while his size won't fade, Gafford might not remain such a strong above-the-rim threat as he nears his 30s.</p><p>Based on those factors, it was important for Dallas to craft an extension with a maximum 20% raise in 2026-27 (a starting salary of $17.3 million) and 5% annual raises that fits restrictions on extend-and-trade deals. By virtue of apparently staying within that, the Mavericks can trade Gafford as soon as he signs the extension -- or, hypothetically, even before then.</p><p>Having Gafford under contract an additional three seasons shouldn't hurt his trade value at all. This extension pays him barely more than the expected 2026-27 non-taxpayer midlevel exception of $15.5 million, and Gafford has easily outpaced that in terms of value thus far. From his perspective, locking in his deal a year ahead of time does take injury risk off the table. So I'd consider this move a win-win.</p><p>The next question is which teams could be in the market for Gafford. He's an obvious fit for the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\">Los Angeles Lakers</a>, having demonstrated his comfort running pick-and-rolls with <a data-player-guid=\"583794eb-0f38-9bbd-3e25-9dd33b7f83b8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic\">Luka Doncic</a>, but that idea seems triggering for already aggrieved Dallas fans. Gafford would be a sensible target for the guard-heavy <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6eade89-5971-0e84-8ccb-cd91482b2b50\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a>, though finding workable matching salary is a challenge unless the Suns get under the second apron.</p><p>If the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9461f397-7882-94c0-c18c-e89bdc9e570e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans Pelicans</a> aren't convinced <a data-player-guid=\"7fc094e9-59a0-3026-bbd8-6208f3ae1826\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5061589/yves-missi\">Yves Missi</a> is a starting-caliber center at this stage of his development, Gafford would be a huge offensive upgrade. I'd also consider a return to Gafford's original team, the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e588ccf1-ba03-ea43-c34c-9a9c8d1895ca\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\">Chicago Bulls</a>, and the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"8aef8547-32f5-0943-a1de-e734567674cc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs\">San Antonio Spurs</a> as wild-card possibilities.</p><p>Of course, the Mavericks may just hold on to Gafford. After all, they spent much of the second half of last season with none of their three starting-caliber centers healthy, so there is value in having depth at the position. And it would be challenging for another would-be contender to offer the perimeter help Dallas seeks, meaning a Gafford trade would most likely need to involve at least three teams.</p><hr><h2>June 14: <a href=\"https://preview.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45512867/sources-rockets-adams-agrees-3-year-39m-extension\">Rockets, Adams agree to three-year extension</a></h2><ul><li><p><em>Agreed to a reported three-year, $39 million contract with <a data-player-guid=\"1173a086-95c4-a53b-2b28-3a646057f63f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991235/steven-adams\">Steven Adams</a> </em></p></li></ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nba/500/hou.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"30\"><strong>Grade: </strong>B</p><p>We're off and running on the 2025 offseason with games still to play in the NBA Finals. Teams aren't allowed to negotiate new contracts with their own free agents until the day after the Finals end, but they can strike extensions with eligible players in the last year of their contracts at any point up to June 30.</p><p>Acquired by the Rockets at the 2024 trade deadline while still recovering from season-ending PCL surgery, Adams initially served as a veteran mentor on a young team and a backup to All-Star center <a data-player-guid=\"dad4f5fb-9739-38ac-b3b5-5d7937c29232\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4871144/alperen-sengun\">Alperen Sengun</a>. His role expanded considerably in the playoffs, when lineups featuring both Adams and Sengun unexpectedly became key to Houston taking the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> the distance after falling behind 3-1 in the series.</p><p>Whether alongside Sengun or as the team's lone center, Adams reached a level in the playoffs that we haven't seen since early in his career. Adams blocked 1.9 shots per 36 minutes, surpassing his best regular-season mark (1.7). And his 60% shooting was way up from 55% during the 2024-25 regular season. My wins above replacement player metric rated Adams the team's fourth-most valuable player in the series, ahead of starters <a data-player-guid=\"653c07b5-8537-14ac-f4c6-b4e37919aca0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3155526/dillon-brooks\">Dillon Brooks</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"e9d2d871-df56-3068-8d5f-e3fc27f49a96\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4437244/jalen-green\">Jalen Green</a>.</p><p>Given that the size and strength that make Adams a dominant offensive rebounder aren't going anywhere, the kind of agility we saw against the Warriors will make him a valuable player for the Rockets as long as he stays healthy.</p><p>Before the PCL injury that cost him the 2023 playoffs and all of 2023-24, Adams had been remarkably durable, playing 76 of 82 games in 2021-22. And Houston will surely be careful with Adams' workload. Although Adams was cleared to play both ends of back-to-back games midway through last season, the Rockets continued to give him one of the games off because of how he recovers after playing the night before.</p><p>Bringing back Adams on a contract in the $13 million range -- a little less than the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel that is the most other teams could have realistically offered -- does push Houston into the luxury tax if the team exercises <a data-player-guid=\"6c6e5179-fc67-908e-bc50-0a5580d64159\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991230/fred-vanvleet\">Fred VanVleet</a>'s $44.9 million team option. And even if the Rockets waive two players with non-guaranteed deals (<a data-player-guid=\"90d9555f-b676-5eb2-7e6b-5b359799602c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3146557/jock-landale\">Jock Landale</a>, at $8 million, and <a data-player-guid=\"326b2250-a154-335b-b637-272db87d8667\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397821/nate-williams\">Nate Williams</a> at the minimum), they'd edge over the lower luxury tax apron by filling out the roster in that scenario.</p><p>Alternatively, Houston could decline the option and try to bring back VanVleet at a smaller starting salary on a longer-term deal that would guarantee him more money at age 31. That decision could be influenced by what other moves the Rockets have cooking. Their tax situation makes it seem unlikely Houston will add a free agent making more than the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel, but the Rockets could make more substantial moves via trade.</p><p>Per ESPN's Bobby Marks, Houston has until June 29 to decide on VanVleet's player option. Barring a blockbuster trade, VanVleet will almost certainly be back, meaning Adams' new contract gives the Rockets a chance to return the entire core that claimed the No. 2 seed in the West.</p>\n</div></div>"

This week we're going to tackle all the pitchers dropping out of the event.</p><h2>What should MLB do about all the pitchers dropping out of the All-Star Game?</h2><p><strong>R.J. Anderson:</strong> I might be the wrong person to ask because my first thought was that  there's not much they can do. Ultimately, the All-Star Game pales in  comparison to those players' individual and team seasons. It's only  logical, then, for these pitchers to make the decisions they're making.  MLB has tried raising the stakes on the game in the past -- to a mixed  reception, if I'm being charitable -- and the only other option that  pops to mind is to incentivize participation with a great financial  reward. Beyond that? Beats me.  </p><p><strong>Dayn Perry:</strong> Yeah, I don't really have any sound ideas about this. The  incentives are just too strong to prioritize regular-season performance  and usage, and also to take the full break for rest and recuperation.  That's how it really should be, of course, as the All-Star Game is  ultimately a meaningless exhibition. Shorten the game to seven innings  and select only \"throw day\" pitchers with ceremonial selections for  pitchers who won't see game action? Financial incentives? I dunno. Or  just keep the pitchers out of it, put up an L screen, let a coach throw  BP, and then have the hitters and fielders cook for a few innings. This  is, at once, neither a serious suggestion nor a suggestion that will become  more serious once I think more about it. Whatever.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Matt Snyder:</strong> I don't really think there's anything they can do.  Several of the pitchers I talked to at media day pointed out how  schedules need to fit perfectly for starting pitchers and they aren't  allowed to stray. It's an exhibition game, ultimately, and we still  always get our fill of stud pitchers. And, really, it's not actually a  big deal in the grand scheme of things. Just to grab an example,  <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2173411/matthew-boyd/\">Matthew Boyd</a> was very proud to be selected to his first All-Star Game at  age 34, but he threw fewer than 40 regular-season innings last year and  he's at 111 ⅔ now, his highest total since 2019. Does it really hurt  anything that he and the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> realize it's not in his best interest to  throw one inning in Atlanta? There will always be plenty of pitchers  willing and able to go one inning and they're making it work.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike Axisa:</strong> I'm not sure this is even a problem. This is just how pitching schedules work. Some guys just won't be available, and we don't even know if this year is the new normal or just a blip. I guess the league could move the All-Star Game to Wednesday and build in that extra day of rest. That would allow them to really highlight the Futures Game. Figure:</p>\n        \n\n<ul><li><strong>Sunday:</strong> MLB games in the afternoon, Day 1 of amateur draft at night</li><li><strong>Monday:</strong> Futures Game</li><li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Home Run Derby</li><li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> All-Star Game</li></ul><p>The players would absolutely hate that. They want Wednesday <em>and</em> Thursday off leading into the second half, and I can't imagine MLB would give up Friday night revenue to move those two off-days to Thursday and Friday, and add an off-day to the All-Star break. Cutting players a check to participate is the obvious solution, I guess, but I don't see a need for it. I'm not convinced this is actually a problem right now.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

This weekend, there is a huge Bartelstein family wedding, as Mark's daughter and Josh sister, Courtney, is set to be married to her fiancé, Max.</p><p>\"Yeah, there's going to be some jokes when I get the mic,\" Josh Bartelstein told ESPN. \"My mom and grandmas are going to love it.\"</p><p>After the wedding, Mark Bartelstein is expected to finalize a contract for Beal to join the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"083a58a6-b849-3501-e67b-059290d12295\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a> in a two-year, $11 million deal that completes a spectacular offseason for the team and ends a disastrous two years for the Suns and Beal.</p><hr><p><strong>THE END OF</strong> Beal's tenure in Phoenix came in three acts.</p><p>1) After new head coach Jordan Ott was hired in early June after a protracted search, he met with Beal and presented him a plan for how he could be used next season, sources said. Beal is coming off a season in which his usage rate was the lowest of his career, his role diminishing under former coach <a data-player-guid=\"45ce1f32-c3aa-5153-5f0f-1830dcce8f6b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1468/mike-budenholzer\">Mike Budenholzer</a>, who even took him out of the starting lineup for a six-week stretch.</p><p>Beal's stats still presented well; he averaged 17 points and shot nearly 50% overall and just under 40% from 3-point range. But playing on a maximum salary, at $50 million, and with the team woefully underachieving, that production didn't match the expectation, or the cost.</p><p>Ott, in his sales pitch to Beal, indicated the Suns had not totally given up on the concept of bringing him back next season. With two years and $113 million left on his contract and a no-trade clause -- which had totally undercut the Suns' ability to deal him last winter -- such a concept wasn't surprising.</p><p>Beal appreciated Ott's efforts, but after postseason meetings with Bartelstein assessing the situation, he had already decided that he needed to move on from Phoenix, if the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>\"We couldn't take the chance [of another lost year],\" Mark Bartelstein told ESPN. \"This decision was about basketball. Bradley wants to play in big games and in big moments.\"</p><p>2) On June 22, the Suns agreed to trade superstar <a data-player-guid=\"dc324fde-eee8-98e2-09ac-d31d8ad9909e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a> to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"78113ad4-1ac7-0c04-dada-388a6ff4e15e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets</a>.</p><p>The return included 23-year-old guard <a data-player-guid=\"e9d2d871-df56-3068-8d5f-e3fc27f49a96\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4437244/jalen-green\">Jalen Green</a>, whom the Suns determined to be a new cornerstone of their perimeter next to <a data-player-guid=\"493046d7-fa60-d8a1-1397-b9a6dca8dedf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a>.</p><p>Before taking the Rockets offer, the Suns had in-depth discussions with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"13f727cb-254d-b484-a337-93fcc0047add\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> about moving Durant for a package that included star center <a data-player-guid=\"78795dbf-3e02-934e-f796-d6a71375c9f5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032976/rudy-gobert\">Rudy Gobert</a>, guard <a data-player-guid=\"a74f6353-1678-ff6e-cab1-ed9cf5300189\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3934673/donte-divincenzo\">Donte DiVincenzo</a>, promising forward <a data-player-guid=\"37335dcf-ed28-c8e9-e8d8-1a6c7ff9dad6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432847/terrence-shannon-jr\">Terrence Shannon Jr</a>. and the 17th pick in this year's draft, sources told ESPN. Had that deal come to fruition, there was a place for Beal in the lineup, and the Suns might've made it a priority to keep him.</p><p>But Durant had made it known that the Wolves were not on his short list of preferred teams. And with just one season left on his contract, Durant had leverage. The talks faded. The deal the Suns made with Houston skewed young and, with Green, left Beal with a role that was undefined, at best.</p><p>Soon after, the Suns gave Beal and Bartelstein permission to speak to other teams about joining them via buyout, the best signal yet that the Beal era in Phoenix was ending. More than 20 teams showed interest, sources said. Eventually Beal met, via Zoom, with half a dozen teams about how he might fit with them.</p><p>3) On July 7, the Clippers traded starting shooting guard <a data-player-guid=\"4941d040-1812-cbb0-27bf-598cd624bc84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2595516/norman-powell\">Norman Powell</a> to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"81e3212c-30ef-9b1b-5edb-453b13ff265a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat\">Miami Heat</a> in a three-team deal that landed them a new starting power forward, <a data-player-guid=\"796e45a0-b375-dfdf-c240-b7550add4966\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3908845/john-collins\">John Collins</a> from the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77cea2fb-1388-b7c8-d171-2e72b3aecbfb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/utah/utah-jazz\">Utah Jazz</a>.</p><p>The Clippers were one of the teams that had already shown interest in Beal and were on his short list. When the Powell deal happened, talks accelerated, sources said. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and head coach Ty Lue, who as a native of Mexico, Missouri, has a long relationship with St. Louis native Beal, spoke to Beal about what the Clippers could offer.</p><p>But the key voice came from <a data-player-guid=\"35b0f455-b1df-0986-121d-27d2b6c18122\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a>, who lobbied the Clippers' front office to chase Beal and then reached out to him directly to make the sale, sources said.</p><p>Harden played in 79 games for the Clippers last season, logging the fifth-most minutes in the league at age 35. He made the All-Star team and the All-NBA squad, but also wanted to ease his burden going into next year and believed Beal could help.</p><p>The pitch was multifaceted, sources said. The Clippers finished the regular season 18-3 before going out in seven games against the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c4aceb39-0eb9-a30b-1120-9cb5b12b677a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets\">Denver Nuggets</a> in the playoffs. The agonizing Game 4 loss, when <a data-player-guid=\"d6c22a9f-fbe3-1566-e175-c86137d057a5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064290/aaron-gordon\">Aaron Gordon</a> threw down a dunk a tenth of a second before the buzzer for the win, left the team bitter, but optimistic.</p><p>Harden sold Beal on the Clippers' depth and talked about how he would work well with Powell, who had a career-best season playing alongside Harden after replacing <a data-player-guid=\"d7e5e918-d53f-018e-9d15-f9005b2390ad\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george\">Paul George</a> in the starting lineup last season.</p><p>He outlined how the Clippers had embraced and helped him pivot in his career after disappointing runs in <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"926db769-d35e-e282-9d7e-a05001d774ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets\">Brooklyn</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ca1685ed-b799-53e4-7924-e58ea6eb8f3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\">Philadelphia</a> damaged his reputation. Beal, coming off a disappointing run in Phoenix that had similarly stunted his value across the league, could relate.</p><p>Harden even took the unusual step of speaking with Mark Bartelstein after all parties, including Harden's agents, approved the conversation. Recruiting a star peer is commonplace in the NBA; recruiting another agent to get on board is not.</p><p>\"No one wants to be released. There's heartache with that,\" Mark Bartelstein said. \"But Bradley wants to be in a position where no one remembers he got released, that they'll remember how he plays next season.\"</p><hr><p><strong>THE SUNS USED</strong> the waive-and-stretch provision to swallow the $99 million owed to Beal over the next five years, which means that money will sit on their cap, at $20 million a season, until the end of the decade.</p><p>It is a brutal position for the team to be in, especially because the Suns don't control their first-round draft pick through 2031. It's extending a mistake deep into the future, when it could haunt them in ways they can't even conceive of yet.</p><p>But the Suns pushed themselves to the decision for several reasons.</p><p>The first, and easier to understand, is money. Over the past two seasons, Suns owner Mat Ishbia had spent $620 million in salary and luxury taxes, and the team didn't win a single playoff game. Being expensive is one thing. Being expensive and losing is quite another, regardless of how deep-pocketed the owner might be.</p><p>Waiving Beal saves the Suns a whopping $175 million this season just in luxury tax, a figure so enormous that it alone could justify spreading the cap pain out over the next five years. When combined with the savings on salary just this season, the maneuver took more than $210 million off the team's balance sheet.</p><p>Though the Suns will have to eventually pay Beal the entire $99 million, the annual $20 million payment in the later years of the deal will likely represent a much smaller percentage of the salary cap than it does now. This sounds good in a PowerPoint presentation, but it might be tough to accept some 50 months from now.</p><p>Still, this move got the Suns out of the second and first aprons, freeing them to utilize all the roster-building tools that they would be locked out of because of their wild overspending. Between the second apron rules and Beal's no-trade clause, the Suns' inability to address their failed roster was crushing. What they did receive in buying Beal out was this flexibility, even though they are still limited by having traded so many draft picks over the past few seasons.</p><p>And there was the Green addition, who the Suns believe will pair well with Booker.</p><p>\"[We] brought in one of the rising stars in the NBA in Jalen,\" Suns general manager Brian Gregory said after the trade was finalized. \"His athleticism and natural ability are off the charts. Jalen has already proven his commitment to putting in the work that excellence requires, and we believe that his approach to the game will allow him to further unlock his incredible upside here in Phoenix.\"</p><p>Getting to the decision was one thing. Making the deal was another. The Suns needed Beal to leave at least $13.9 million from his remaining two seasons to make the buyout legal under league rules. The Suns were right up against the maximum 15% of the salary cap allocated to bought-out players and needed Beal's cooperation.</p><p>The Suns had hoped to get Beal to leave more money on the table than just the $13.9 million. Talks went back and forth and got heated, sources said. Ultimately, Beal left the least amount possible to make the waiver work, to the penny.</p><p>\"There were some intense conversations,\" Mark Bartelstein said.</p><p><strong>BEAL AGREED TO</strong> sign with Clippers for about $5.4 million this season, every penny they had left in their midlevel exception after giving <a data-player-guid=\"3496fbc1-fa88-c332-7f91-f015006e0c8b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez\">Brook Lopez</a> a two-year deal starting at $8.7 million earlier in July.</p><p>Beal will lose a little bit of money than what he had guaranteed, but with a player option that will allow him to become a free agent again next summer at age 33, he's hoping a productive year in Los Angeles will enable him to recoup it and more.</p><p>Beal's numbers last season felt underwhelming at his $50 million salary, but if he comes close to duplicating them for the Clippers, costing 90% less, it's an unmitigated success story.</p><p>When L.A. entered contract talks with Harden after the season, both sides understood the need to further add to the roster. Harden ultimately agreed on a new two-year deal for $81 million with a player option for next season.</p><p>Harden's $39 million salary this upcoming season, a $6 million raise from last year, left the full midlevel exception available for the Clippers to use. Then he helped recruit players such as Lopez and Beal into those salary slots.</p><p>In the end, the Clippers turned Powell and their midlevel exception into Lopez, Beal and Collins this summer, building the depth they sought. With Collins in the final year of his contract, at $27 million, and the Clippers holding team options on <a data-player-guid=\"db759921-c2d4-28de-f1eb-66f1c0aa708f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3037789/bogdan-bogdanovic\">Bogdan Bogdanovic</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"e83378ef-622a-a884-12bb-86482f9a84d2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3416/nicolas-batum\">Nico Batum</a> and Lopez, they are in position to have enough cap space to offer a maximum contract next summer, if they so choose.</p><p>Beal and Harden, both of whom have those opt-outs, are incentivized to have big seasons. <a data-player-guid=\"87ff907c-c68c-a82d-1215-37e05d0c62ef\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a> is coming off his first healthy summer in years and, per team president Lawrence Frank, kept doing full workouts into June after the playoff loss to prepare his body for a deep playoff run next season.</p><p>Best-laid plans have frequently turned into nightmares for the Clippers this decade. But on a day when the Suns and Beal were trying to rationalize and mitigate their losses as their breakup was formalized, the Clippers were the ones quietly landing value.</p><p>And just in time for the rehearsal dinner.</p>\n</div></div>"

When some people hear that term, they start seeing red. They lose all ability to understand nuance and just think you mean, explicitly, \"This player is bad and there is no way they will ever be good.\"</p><p>But that's not how anyone actually uses the term. Well, not never, necessarily, but usually not. It usually means, \"This player is overvalued,\" or, if you want to be even more weaselly about it, \"This player is probably good but comes with a lot of risk that makes their price tough to justify paying.\"</p><p>But in the context of this week's exercise, where we're looking for sleepers, breakouts, and now busts for the second half of the season, it <em>mostly</em> just means, \"This player won't be as good in the second half of the season as they were in the first.\" But even that requires some nuance.&nbsp;</p><p>Take <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/fantasy/\">Cal Raleigh</a>, for example. He probably won't be as good in the second half as he was in the first. If only because, when someone gets <em>that much better</em>, to the point where they are on pace to accomplish something historic – in Raleigh's case, \"Break the single-season record for homers by a catcher by more than 15\" – expecting regression <em>shouldn't</em> be taken as skepticism. Raleigh is putting together one of the best seasons ever by a catcher, and that would be true even if he is on a 50-homer pace in the second half rather than a 64-homer pace.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>So, no, I'm not saying Cal Raleigh is a \"bust\" for the rest of the season, even if I think he's likely to take a step back. That term doesn't fit for him. But it fits for the eight players I'm talking about in the rest of today's newsletter, and for more picks, plus some sleepers and breakouts – from Scott White and Frank Stampfl, make sure you check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuEaFspMOM0&amp;ab_channel=FantasyBaseballToday\">last night's episode of Fantasy Baseball Today</a>. We'll be back tomorrow with some bold predictions for the second half of the season and some help setting your lineups with games picking back up Friday, but for now, here are some bust picks for the second half:&nbsp;</p><h2>Second-half busts</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615365/pete-crow-armstrong/fantasy/\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a>, OF, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> – Is it okay for me to say that I was clearly wrong about Crow-Armstrong being a bust before the season, and also think that he's clearly one of the most obvious sell-high candidates in Fantasy right now? Even ranking him 17th in my \"re-drafting the first two rounds\" piece wasn't enough for some people! I whiffed on Crow-Armstrong, but if you think his skill set is that of a clear top-10 player, then yes, I think you are probably overrating him at this point. As good as he has been this season, he's overperformed his expected stats, though by less lately than he was earlier, and there remains a lot of risk inherent in his profile because of how bad his approach at the plate is. He's made it work for him, obviously, and his speed will help keep his skill set afloat even if things go wrong for him. But Crow-Armstrong manages to combine one of the most aggressive swings in baseball with below-average (not bad, mind you, but below average) contact skills, and at some point, that's going to catch up to him. Not enough to make him one of the worst hitters in baseball, like I feared might be in his range of outcomes before the season – his extremely high pull-air rate should help him continue to post strong results when he makes contact – but enough that he could seriously disappoint down the stretch.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2167332/jacob-wilson/fantasy/\">Jacob Wilson</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/\">Athletics</a> – Wilson is such a fun player. He's got that weird batting stance, where it looks like he's <a href=\"https://blogs.fangraphs.com/jacob-wilson-is-an-unbalanced-load/\" rel=\"nofollow\">riding a horse sideways</a>(?), and yet he's somehow managed to ride that proverbial horse to the All-Star game and a well-earned reputation as one of the premier contact hitters in baseball. But here's the thing: Hitting .332 forever is really hard. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821318/luis-arraez/fantasy/\">Luis Arraez</a> has managed that feat once in a full season, and while Wilson <em>might</em> be a better hitter than Arraez, it's probably a bit too early to declare that with confidence. Even for great contact hitters, batting average fluctuates a ton, and for as good as Wilson is, his expected batting average is only .287. Arraez has bested that in four of his past five seasons, sometimes by more than 20 points. He also doesn't hit the ball as hard as Arraez, and only hits the ball to the pull side in the air marginally more frequently. Which is all to say, while Wilson <em>looks</em> like a better version of Arraez based on the first 90 or so games of this season, I'm not actually convinced he is. Wilson might just be a more dynamic player than Arraez in ways those stats can't quantify, but if his batting average slips to even the .280-ish range, he goes from looking like a star to a pretty fringe-y Fantasy player thanks to his lack of other skills beyond his batting average.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945488/trevor-story/fantasy/\">Trevor Story</a>, SS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a> – Look, the fact that Trevor Story has managed to stay healthy and look like a viable major-leaguer at all is a huge win for the Red Sox after the way things have gone since his signing there. And, for all his flaws, which we'll get to, Story still has a remarkably Fantasy-friendly skill set, with 15 homers and 16 steals on the season. We'll take a 25-25 season, even if it comes with a poor batting average. But Story has already matched his high for games played since getting to Boston, so I think we have to treat him with elevated injury risk at this point, and I'm also just not sure it makes sense to keep betting on him being as productive as he has been. His underlying numbers aren't far off what he has produced so far, but we're talking about a guy with some of the worst plate discipline in baseball, and we've already seen what the downside can look like when he goes cold – he had a .158/.200/.232 line with a 34% strikeout rate in May. Expecting something like a low-.700s OPS and decent power and speed from Story is reasonable, but the downside outcomes are significant enough that I think cashing in on Story right now is the best move.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2794938/zach-mckinstry/fantasy/\">Zach McKinstry</a>, 3B, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a> – It's a remarkable story. McKinstry made his first All-Star game as a 30-year-old and has been a key contributor to one of the best teams in the league. It's incredible. It's also almost certainly not real. McKinstry does have better underlying numbers than ever before, but they aren't anywhere close to what he's actually produced, as seen by his .324 xwOBA compared to his actual .360 mark. And his batted ball profile and plate discipline numbers don't look so different from last year, in a way that makes me think even the underlying numbers are probably pretty flukey. I don't know how much value McKinstry has out there in trades, so your best bet might be to just ride the hot hand until he inevitably falls apart, but if I could get anything useful for McKinstry in trade, I would.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2931905/kris-bubic/fantasy/\">Kris Bubic</a>, SP, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/KC/kansas-city-royals/\">Royals</a> – I haven't seen any official word from the Royals on limiting Bubic's workload in the second half of the season, but they've got to, right? He has an extensive injury history and has already thrown 24 more innings than he did in 2023 and 2024 combined. Are they really going to let him throw the 190-plus innings he's currently on pace for when he's never thrown more than 149.1 in a season before/ It is, of course, possible – as Scott White has pointed out on the FBT podcast multiple times, Bubic only has one year of team control left after this year, so it's not like the Royals have to keep an eye on the long-term ramifications of his usage – but there aren't a lot of examples of pitchers seeing this kind of workload bump from one year to the next, either. Bubic has already looked a bit more hittable of late, as he has an ERA over 4.00 and a WHIP over 1.40 since the start of June, and it's possible he just falls apart in the second half, too. As great of a story as his breakout has been, carrying it over into the second half might be asking too much.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837374/drew-rasmussen/fantasy/\">Drew Rasmussen</a>, SP, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/\">Rays</a> – The Rays used Rasmussen as an overqualified opener for his final two starts of the first half, limiting him to just two innings in those two starts as a way to manage his innings – he's already up to 91.1 after throwing just 36 last season while recovering from elbow surgery – and while the Rays have said they'll likely give him a longer leash in future starts, he has a 150-inning limit for the season, per the Tampa Bay Times. With about 14 turns through the rotation remaining, you'd hit that 150-inning limit well before the season ends, even if he was averaging just five per start, and that would leave nothing for the postseason, a problem for a Rays team just 1.5 games back of a postseason spot. Even with some skipped starts and extra days of rest there, 12 more starts at five innings per would push him right to that limit. The math is just hard to make work without Rasmussen being severely limited in the second half. As good as he is, I think Rasmussen's value is likely to be pretty fringe-y in the second half, unfortunately.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044540/clay-holmes/fantasy/\">Clay Holmes</a>, SP, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a> – The Mets haven't said anything specific about limiting Holmes' workload, but this is one where I'm not sure the concern is really about him being limited in the second half. I think Holmes is just going to struggle. He hasn't gone six innings since June 7 and has 18 walks to 18 strikeouts in 30 innings in that time, despite somehow maintaining a decent enough 4.20 ERA. His elite groundball rate will help in that regard, but I don't think it's going to be enough to overcome what has become both a below-average strikeout rate <em>and</em> an above-average walk rate. His xERA of 4.19 suggests he's been very lucky so far, and that's without even accounting for the likelihood of some fatigue-related regression.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1717646/aroldis-chapman/fantasy/\">Aroldis Chapman</a>, RP, Red Sox – The other thing we have to account for coming out of the second half is the trade deadline. The Red Sox's active 10-game winning streak significantly lowers the chance we're going to see a sell-off here, so maybe Chapman stays put as the team's closer. But with two weeks left until the deadline, there's a lot that could go wrong between then and now that could force the All-Star closer out of the picture. If not him, then we could see the likes of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1208718/kenley-jansen/fantasy/\">Kenley Jansen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2739972/kyle-finnegan/fantasy/\">Kyle Finnegan</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821492/david-bednar/fantasy/\">David Bednar</a> moved somewhere they might not necessarily be assured of a closer job – higher-end names like <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2821464/felix-bautista/fantasy/\">Felix Bautista</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911802/mason-miller/fantasy/\">Mason Miller</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3107591/emmanuel-clase/fantasy/\">Emmanuel Clase</a> could be moved at the deadline, though all three would almost certainly be sent to an even better team where they would likely remain the closer, so it's less of a concern. But the next two weeks could really change how Chapman, Jansen, Finnegan, and Bednar are valued.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

It wasn't until last year that she was drafted for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>With the ninth pick in their expansion draft, the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/GS/golden-state-valkyries/\">Golden State Valkyries</a> selected Thornton from the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">New York Liberty</a>&nbsp;-- a major blow to the reigning champions, who had more key players than they were allowed to protect. Thornton's Liberty teammates were gutted by her departure.&nbsp;</p><p>Seven months later, Thornton admits that she, too, was not initially thrilled. \"I just won a championship in New York, and in my head I'm thinking repeat,\" Thornton said. But after a conversation with Valkyries general manager Ohemaa Nyanin, who worked for the Liberty from 2019 through May of 2024, Thornton let her guard down. She was willing to trust the Valkyries' vision and get out of her comfort zone.&nbsp;</p><p>The initial results, for both Thornton and the Valkyries, have been better than anyone could have expected.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n\n<p>Dating back to her days at UTEP, when she was a two-time Conference USA All-Defense honoree, Thornton has relished her work on that side of the ball. \"You're talking to someone who loves defense,\" she said. Throughout her WNBA career, she's primarily been tasked with being a defensive-minded role player who can swing games with her energy and knock down open shots that come her way.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Thornton even arrived in the Bay Area, she knew she would have to become a \"two-way player\" this season. Without a true No. 1 option on offense, the Valkyries have asked Thornton to take on more responsibility as a scorer. Her 22.7% usage rate is by far the highest mark of her career, as are her 14 points per game. She leads the team in both categories, and is also adding seven rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.3 steals.&nbsp;</p><p>Against the Chicago Sky on June 27, Thornton set a new career-high with 29 points. In 22 games with the Valkyries, she has four 20-point outings. In her previous 274 WNBA appearances, Thornton reached the 20-point mark five times.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>Thornton's 2024 vs. 2025 numbers</h2><table data-title=\"3x7 Table\"><tbody><tr><th>Year</th><th>MPG</th><th>PPG</th><th>RPG</th><th>APG</th><th>SPG</th><th>USG</th></tr><tr><td><p>2024</p></td><td><p>20.2</p></td><td><p>5.5</p></td><td><p>2.6</p></td><td><p>0.7</p></td><td><p>0.7</p></td><td><p>12.6%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2025</p></td><td><p>30.1</p></td><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>1.5</p></td><td><p>1.3</p></td><td><p>22.7%</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>\"It is an opportunity for her to show her skill set,\" Valkyries coach Natalie Nakase <a href=\"https://www.thenexthoops.com/wnba/golden-state-valkyries/kayla-thornton-golden-state-valkyries-wnba-all-star/\" rel=\"nofollow\">said earlier this month</a>. \"She was on a team in New York that had a lot of firepower and she was playing behind [Breanna Stewart]. It wasn't that she wasn't capable, but the mindset she has, the minutes she is playing, it can boost a player's confidence. What she is doing now, that's confidence.\"</p><p>Thornton's efforts have not gone unnoticed. On June 17, she was named Western Conference Player of the Week. On July 6, she was named an All-Star for the first time in her career, and will represent the Valkyries in Indianapolis this weekend. She is not only the first All-Star in Valkyries history, but the first player from an expansion team to make an All-Star Game as a non-injury replacement since 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>Thornton called the honor a \"blessing,\" adding, \"I never thought I would get to this moment.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"We are ecstatic for her,\" Valkyries president Jess Smith said. \"Watching her journey as a player and just watching her perform and be embraced by this fan base in this way, it's so fun… it's amazing to have the Valkyries represented through her.\"</p>\n<p>With Thornton leading the way, the Valkyries have already exceeded expectations. They were widely projected to be the worst team in the league -- \"I really don't pay attention to stuff like that,\" Thornton said -- but entered the All-Star break in ninth place at 10-12 thanks to a strong defense and an electric home-court advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>The Valkyries lead the league in field goal defense at 40.1%, and are fourth in defensive rating at 98.8. \"That's our identity, that's who we are,\" Thornton said. At home inside the Chase Center, a.k.a \"Ballhalla,\" they're 7-4. \"It's been unbelievable,\" Thornton added. \"When Ballhalla gets turnt up, they turn up.\"&nbsp;</p><p>While a recent skid has dropped the Valkyries below .500, they already have more wins than the two most recent expansion teams – the 2008 <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/ATL/atlanta-dream/\">Atlanta Dream</a> and 2006 Chicago Sky – combined (nine). Sitting just one game back of the seventh-place <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/WAS/washington-mystics/\">Washington Mystics</a> and eighth-place <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a>, they have a real chance to become the first expansion team in WNBA history to make the playoffs in their inaugural season.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, the Valkyries are just trying to take things \"one game at a time\" and enjoy the ride, which for Thornton will include a stop in Indy. She'll be suiting up for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/CLK/team-clark-allstars/\">Team Clark</a>, captained by <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever</a> star <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a>, who picked Thornton in the All-Star Draft on July 8. From no draft selections in 11 years to two in seven months.&nbsp;</p><p>Come Saturday night, when Thornton puts on her 15th professional jersey, she won't have to worry about getting out her passport or fighting for her job.&nbsp;</p><p>\"This is my first [All-Star], so just going to take it all in and learn and be surrounded by the best in the world and just enjoy myself,\" Thornton said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Angels for MLB.com from 2012 to 2016.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p>ATLANTA -- The back section of the Coca-Cola Roxy, a small concert venue that hosted the first round of Major League Baseball's draft, was cordoned off with stanchions Sunday night. Gray couches had been arranged for draft hopefuls to lounge alongside their traveling parties while waiting for their names to be called by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, but there was one distinct problem:</p><p>Nobody was in them.</p><p>Four years ago, MLB pushed its draft back, paired it with the rest of its All-Star Game festivities and envisioned a grander affair, with fans in attendance, a national audience watching and players, outfitted with lavish suits, approaching the stage to don their first professional caps and jerseys. But between only six and eight players showed each year from 2021 to 2024. And this year, with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"122673a3-bf06-4432-6950-b8a32e52ac2e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a> and Truist Park serving as hosts, player attendance was reduced to nothing. One or two amateurs expressed interest in going and were told not to bother.</p><p>In MLB's mind, one or two was worse than zero.</p><p>Two days later, while fielding questions from members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Manfred touted the \"progress\" of MLB's draft product, praising both the broadcast and the atmosphere of its most recent version, but acknowledged that player attendance is \"obviously an important part.\"</p><p>\"Some of it is luck of the draw,\" Manfred said Tuesday. \"Some agencies take the position that they don't want their players there for reasons they'll have to explain to you. I can't. Because I believe it's an important step in terms of marketing a player and making him a star when he gets to the big leagues. Having said that, they give the advice they give.\"</p><p>Three agencies in particular that have been identified by league officials as dissuading clients from attending MLB's draft are The Boras Corporation, Excel Sports Management and Wasserman, which combined to represent 18 of this year's top 30 picks.</p><p>Representatives from each of the three agencies denied possessing a hard-and-fast rule preventing players from attending the draft, stating that those decisions ultimately rest with their clients. But those agencies, as well as other agents throughout the industry, did identify two key reasons why some of their clients ultimately don't attend.</p><p>One is that amateurs, particularly those who just graduated high school, don't want to subject themselves to the public shame of potentially seeing their names fall in the draft, preferring instead to host draft parties surrounded by friends and family members from home. Another, more prominent reason is that the MLB draft's economic landscape disincentivizes it.</p><p>Each selection within the first 10 rounds comes with an assigned value, but teams are free to divide their total draft bonus pools however they would like. Signing bonuses, then, are subject to negotiations. And those talks often take place minutes before players are selected, potentially influencing whether teams take them at certain spots. After that, deals still need to be finalized. Scott Boras, baseball's most influential agent, believes attending a draft can hinder leverage.</p><p>\"I have players that are drafted, and they still have to negotiate their contracts,\" Boras said. \"You can't go out there and parade in front of a live audience saying, 'I am with the team,' without knowing that they are going to be with the team. We still have other options.\"</p><p>High school players can choose to attend the universities they are already committed to, a bigger draw with the money generated through name, image and likeness deals. College juniors can opt to return for their senior years. All of them can decline the bonuses offered by teams.</p><p>\"The nature of our unique draft system and the culture of the amateur players is the reason why they mostly choose not to attend,\" Joel Wolfe, an executive vice president on the baseball side at Wasserman, wrote in a text message. \"Our first round is so unpredictable -- there's probably 50 to 80 kids that think they might get taken. Players aren't selected simply in order of their highest value or ranking. There's a lot more that happens leading right up to the moment they're selected.\"</p><p>Last year, three of the top 12 and six of the top 24 players selected were present at the draft. In each of the previous three years, one of the players in attendance was taken within the first six picks, including two <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> selections, <a data-player-guid=\"18de9dda-642a-3886-a141-98d7d9419545\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4418683/henry-davis\">Henry Davis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080632/termarr-johnson\">Termarr Johnson</a>, who went first and fourth, respectively. This year, even though 12 of the first 30 players drafted were either from Georgia or a neighboring state, none showed up.</p><p>\"Sad,\" said a player rep who is not affiliated with any of the aforementioned agencies.</p><p>\"Embarrassing,\" said another.</p><p>But outside of sizable economic changes that would trigger hard slots in the draft -- one that would have to wait until negotiations restart for a new collective bargaining agreement, with the current one expiring after the 2026 season -- the league doesn't seem to possess many options.</p><p>This year, MLB upped its incentive package in hopes of luring more draft hopefuls. They offered six round-trip flights, three hotel rooms and six tickets to the Home Run Derby and All-Star Game, along with the opportunity to chat with players during batting practice, attend the Red Carpet Show, meet Hall of Famers and celebrities and be featured on the league's social media channels, among other perks. Clearly, it wasn't enough.</p><p>Manfred said he has had conversations with representatives from some of the more prominent agencies \"in an effort to create an understanding that this is part of a broader player-marketing effort that starts with the combine, continues through the draft, continues through adding minor league baseball games to MLB.TV so people can see these young players, and then making a big deal out of it when they get their chance in the big leagues.\"</p><p>The path from the amateur ranks to the major leagues can be long and arduous, with few exceptions. It will probably be at least three years before the vast majority of the 615 players drafted Sunday and Monday reach the highest level of their profession, if they make it at all.</p><p>That lack of instant gratification is among the obvious reasons why the MLB draft will never come close to reaching the popularity of the NFL and NBA versions, two sports that also give teams less flexibility with draft signing bonuses. College basketball and college football are also far more popular than college baseball, making fans more invested in players leading up to when their names are called.</p><p>The MLB draft drew 863,000 viewers across ESPN and MLB Network in 2024, its second-largest audience and roughly three times greater than what it typically attracted in prior decades. But even its best ratings are dwarfed by the NFL and NBA, which drew 13.6 and 3.8 million viewers to its 2025 drafts, respectively. MLB officials have no illusions of someday reaching those numbers. What they would like, though, is for the players, and their reps, to be more invested in making the draft feel important.</p><p>One agent suggested paying players for attending, like they do major leaguers who take part in the Home Run Derby. Another suggested cutting off communication between teams and their agents once a draft starts, eliminating a lot of the chaos before picks are made.</p><p>Otherwise, in the words of another agent, \"It makes more sense for them to be home with their family around them when calls are rolling in. It's very stressful.\"</p><p><em>ESPN's Kiley McDaniel contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</div></div>"

Christmas starts in July, is four weeks long and comes with a present nearly every single day: That your favorite third-string receiver made a tough snag over the middle in double coverage; that the undersized, small-school undrafted pass rusher is once again terrorizing the backup offensive line; that everybody -- and I mean <i>everybody</i> -- is in the best shape of his life.</p><p>It's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> training camp, folks. And it's right around the corner, with veteran players for the Chargers and Lions reporting to camp later this week, ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44816997/chargers-lions-meet-2025-pro-football-hall-fame-game\">Hall of Fame Game</a> on July 31.</p><p>There's little I look forward to more than the first video to hit my timeline of a few star players jogging out onto the practice field. Perhaps the only thing I cherish more are answers to the following questions, winners of the following positional battles, health for the following injuries and updates on the following rookies.

There is no question about this, none at all. Two of his best acts with the Lions have been as follows: hiring Aaron Glenn as defensive coordinator, and promoting Ben Johnson to offensive coordinator after his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30766148/sources-lions-hire-ex-chargers-coach-anthony-lynn-offensive-coordinator\">first hiring</a> (Anthony Lynn) <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33036043/anthony-lynn-detroit-lions-offensive-coordinator\">didn't work out</a>.</p><p>Those are the only moves Campbell has needed to make at coordinator over his four years in Detroit -- a rare thing for a team as successful as the Lions have been. After years of interest, both Glenn and Johnson have finally taken head coaching jobs elsewhere, which raises a few questions. The first: Just how good is Campbell's eye for coaching talent? New DC Kelvin Sheppard was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43562932/lions-promote-lbs-coach-kelvin-sheppard-dc\">promoted</a> from the linebackers coaching job, but Campbell first worked with him back in 2014-15, when Sheppard was still a player on the Dolphins. He's been the defensive coordinator-in-waiting for a while now. What does Campbell see in him? And will that vision be realized?</p><p>On the offensive side of the ball, where plenty of candidates for internal promotion were available (Hank Fraley, Tanner Engstrand, Antwan Randel El), Campbell went for an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43598107/lions-working-hire-broncos-john-morton-oc-sources-say\">external hire</a> in John Morton. There is some familiarity there, as Morton spent the 2022 season as the Lions' senior offensive assistant. Does he have a particularly strong relationship with <a data-player-guid=\"987f4f39-ed6f-5915-57eb-ec7dc356171c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a>, who will need to shoulder a greater load now that Johnson has left the building? Can Morton bring the same creativity, the same situational excellence that powered the Lions' fourth-down approach of seasons past?</p><p>The Lions are transitioning from a rebuilt upstart to a bona fide force, and that means they must combat brain drain. This is Campbell's first crack at replacing key staff departures, and getting it right is critical to completing the total team turnaround.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What does <a data-player-guid=\"7e9fbd60-951e-2d9a-8d8c-b3f1ab6c4a4d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a> do with this (last) chance?</h2><p>When Fields <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39747346/sources-bears-trading-qb-justin-fields-steelers\">finally got out</a> of Chicago last season, I was thrilled for him. Few franchises have been worse at QB development over the past several seasons than the Bears. The Steelers are another such candidate, as they have struggled to modernize their offensive approach or flood their roster with pass catchers for a young quarterback. Of course, Fields joined Pittsburgh as a backup behind <a data-player-guid=\"f0610946-ceb6-9a99-3bcc-cf110b2078b5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>, and he started only six games while Wilson recovered from a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41853236/steelers-russell-wilson-preparing-get-ready-go-vs-jets\">calf injury</a>.</p><p>Rather surprisingly, the Jets gave him a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44194622/jets-reach-2-year-40m-deal-qb-justin-fields-sources-say\">starter's deal</a> and an unimpeded path to the QB1 job. The Jets are another candidate for our \"even worse than the Bears at quarterback development\" list, but it's a new staff in New York -- namely, head coach Aaron Glenn and offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand. Both came from Detroit, and Glenn in particular watched his defenses get ravaged by Fields' legs twice a season. Fields' last three games as a Bear against Glenn's defense: 12 carries for 58 yards and a touchdown; 10 carries for 132 yards; 13 carries for 147 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>Now, the Jets have few pass catchers behind <a data-player-guid=\"da106063-995d-eaf0-54e4-ccecd5e90767\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson\">Garrett Wilson</a>, but they have a pretty solid offensive line. I don't think they'll tip their hand (and put Fields in harm's way) too much during training camp, but I'll be watching the reports closely. And I won't be surprised if we see a 2022-like season for Fields. Back then, he posted 160 carries for 1,143 yards, the second most <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35361863/bears-cite-experience-keeping-justin-fields-lopsided-loss\">all time</a> for a quarterback. If he can replicate that season with his legs, while getting more passing game help from Engstrand and Wilson than he ever got in Chicago, there just might be something there.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/min.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What is <a data-player-guid=\"460fbf74-c64d-3862-b942-852d104e94dd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4433970/jj-mccarthy\">J.J.

I can draw two parallel universes for you. In the first, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45375201/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-justin-jefferson\">a year of rehab</a> gave McCarthy the opportunity to prepare mentally, and he is accordingly as sharp as a tack under center -- no rookie mistakes. Fully <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44919491/nfl-minnesota-vikings-jj-mccarthy-nfl-draft\">physically recovered</a>, he offers more on the boot than Darnold ever did, creating a new layer in the already dangerous Vikings offense. Minnesota hits the ground <i>running</i>.</p><p>In the other, Minnesota really does hit the ground running because McCarthy isn't ready. He is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44921044/qb-jj-mccarthy-know-ready-start-vikings\">uncertain on the knee</a> and still adjusting to NFL speed, and it's not like he was a pass-heavy maven in college either. The Vikings heavily rely on a retooled offensive line, as well as a running back by committee with <a data-player-guid=\"ca688cbe-b781-01a6-69f2-eb87420aec83\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360569/jordan-mason\">Jordan Mason</a> joining <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042519/aaron-jones-sr\">Aaron Jones</a>.

McCarthy and the Minnesota Vikings.</p></div></div><p>These two worlds, and every world in between, feel possible for the Vikings. We shouldn't overreact to anything we get in training camp, especially negative. The McCarthy we get in August won't be the McCarthy we see in December, as a season's worth of NFL action teaches some big lessons. But the Vikings are in a competitive division and harbor deep playoff aspirations. They only have so much leash to give a rookie, especially when you consider how easily Kevin O'Connell has made veteran quarterbacks shine in this offense. McCarthy's health and confidence are about as big of a July storyline as you get in the NFL.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/cin.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>What happens with <a data-player-guid=\"7ab1c7ee-fd75-435d-b0c5-613879216083\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052743/trey-hendrickson\">Trey Hendrickson</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"ee8dca16-7ec4-3fa6-8c10-6cc028cd1802\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685562/shemar-stewart\">Shemar Stewart</a>?</h2><p>I remain confident that the two most obvious things will happen in Cincinnati: The Bengals will <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45362772/nfl-bengals-trey-hendrickson-contract-holdout\">reach an extension</a> with Hendrickson that makes him a top-three highest-paid defensive player in football, and they will give Stewart the rookie contract language <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45498593/source-shemar-stewart-leaves-bengals-minicamp-amid-contract-dispute\">he seeks</a> so he can start practicing.</p><p>However, there's a not-insubstantial (excellent writing there; I'm a professional) chance at least one of these takes a left turn. Hendrickson seems to have more internal locker room support for a prolonged holdout than any other player I can remember. Everyone in a Bengals uniform knows he has carried that defense for a long time, and in no season was that more obvious than last year. If Hendrickson flatly rejects every offer the Bengals give him and tries to reinvigorate trade markets as other teams reevaluate their rosters during training camp, I will be surprised. But not shocked.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45500644/nfl-bengals-shemar-stewart-contract-holdout-trade-college\">Stewart situation</a> feels tied to the Hendrickson situation. If Hendrickson is holding out (or holding in, as that's the method these days), then the Bengals will swiftly revert their rookie contract language and get Stewart practicing -- they need him even more than they thought. But what if the Hendrickson deal gets done before camp? I can see the Bengals \"losing\" the Hendrickson negotiation (i.e., paying him a bajillion dollars), and digging their heels in on the Stewart contract as a result.</p><p>Again: I still strongly believe we're going to get the expected outcome on both of these deals, but I'm not counting my chickens just yet.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/hou.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/tb.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2>Can Nick Caley get it going? And can Josh Grizzard keep it going?</h2><p>With every offseason, it feels like new offensive coordinators have bigger and bigger leverage in surprising team outcomes. Compare the 2024 Eagles to the 2023 Eagles if you don't believe me -- a playcaller can just as easily tank a humming offense as he can resurrect a fallen one.</p><p>In the latter case this season, we have <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43680408/texans-hiring-rams-nick-caley-new-oc-source-says\">new Texans offensive coordinator</a> Nick Caley, who inherits a Texans offense that fell from lofty expectations in 2024. Houston's approach to pass protection proved far too rudimentary, and opposing defenses easily found pressure schematically. They found it against personnel as well, so the Texans retooled their offensive line accordingly.</p><p>It's easy to poke holes in the 2025 Texans' offensive personnel. Rookie receivers fill the depth chart behind <a data-player-guid=\"338aa0be-bd63-1a24-1929-796af121cefb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4258173/nico-collins\">Nico Collins</a>. <a data-player-guid=\"0c22d637-c0d7-6bac-7333-dc3a992bdc0d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895856/christian-kirk\">Christian Kirk</a> is returning from a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42042587/sources-jaguars-wr-christian-kirk-broken-collarbone\">collarbone injury</a>; <a data-player-guid=\"dd36357c-436b-f059-d957-ddbb12cf33ab\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4366031/tank-dell\">Tank Dell</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44125809/texans-wr-tank-dell-undergoes-another-surgery-knee\">might not be back</a> this season at all. The offensive line is young and shuffled.

He needs reps on the field.</p><p>His status for training camp is still uncertain, as Johnson said Loveland will be cleared \"<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45538598/2025-nfl-draft-rookie-updates-minicamp-otas\">at some point</a>\" during camp. With such significant draft capital spent on the tight end, it's reasonable to expect that Johnson plans to feature Loveland in the offense. Remember, Johnson is inheriting <a data-player-guid=\"f90765ad-da8a-9a88-8beb-568c2812636d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915416/dj-moore\">DJ Moore</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"774cc71b-e83e-340d-bcda-4a8558265bb5\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431299/rome-odunze\">Rome Odunze</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"e299b636-92cc-183f-656e-8c00e3350f25\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4258595/cole-kmet\">Cole Kmet</a>, but he hand-selected Loveland.

This is doubly tricky for Campbell, who is a hybrid edge/LB, and will need to learn how to play on- and off-ball at the NFL level. Fangio and the Eagles would also benefit from seeing the rookie play multiple roles in camp, so they can determine where his best NFL future may be.</p><p>The good news for the Eagles is that they went through a similar issue last year. Rookie defensive back <a data-player-guid=\"9c7274f7-268c-3559-b6eb-fec3738c9c65\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4682618/cooper-dejean\">Cooper DeJean</a>, another highly versatile player drafted at No. 40 overall, missed much of training camp with a hamstring injury and only saw game action in Week 6. DeJean immediately elevated the Eagles' defense to Super Bowl levels. It's unreasonable to expect the same from Campbell, of course, but the staff has proven their ability to handle a rookie's limited onboarding.</p><hr><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/dal.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><h2><a data-player-guid=\"64944dd8-160f-0726-2b9d-4e82e22db36e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362088/demarvion-overshown\">DeMarvion Overshown</a>, LB, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b0fc8fb7-9dbe-e574-9008-6f0ee7c6b234\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a></h2><p>One of the breakout stars of the 2024 season, Overshown started 12 games and collected 90 tackles along with five sacks, three pass breakups, an interception and a forced fumble. Then, in Week 14, he <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42893482/jerry-jones-demarvion-overshown-right-knee-surgery\">tore the ACL, PCL and MCL</a> in his right knee -- less than two years after an <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38229440/source-cowboys-lb-demarvion-overshown-torn-acl\">ACL tear</a> in his left knee robbed him of his rookie season.</p><p>Overshown should be one of two starting linebackers under new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, but when exactly he gets back on the field is something to monitor. He gave a bullish update on his health to the <a href=\"https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/demarvion-overshown-on-injury-rehab-learning-from-matt-eberflus-more\">Cowboys team site</a> in May: \"I think it really couldn't be any better. If it was better, I'd probably be out there playing right now. Where I'm at in my rehab, in my process, it's where I'm supposed to be plus some.\"</p><p>That sounds rosy, but expect the Cowboys to be cautious with Overshown (as one should be with a player who tore three ligaments in one knee). Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said in April the team does not expect Overshown to start the season, and local reporters have tagged November as a likely window to return. I'd be stunned if we see him do much during camp, but if he really is ahead on his rehab, we could see the rumblings in August of an early return to action.</p><hr><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><h2><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567962/jermaine-johnson\">Jermaine Johnson</a>, Edge, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"732d3caf-b350-1e34-48c6-b7cebb4a0d88\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a></h2><p>Johnson played his way into the Pro Bowl with a breakout 2023 season, and expectations were sky high for 2024.

Because of the scheme switch from Robert Saleh to Glenn, it's important that Johnson gets at least some time to knock the rust off in August.</p><p>Athletes returning from Achilles tears can also struggle for months to reclaim their old explosiveness. To accurately gauge how he might impact the game in September, if and when he's back in Week 1, it's important to get a good look at him on the move during camp.</p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"><h2>Five rookies to watch</h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/lar.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"><h2><a data-player-guid=\"897a7b37-1f13-3f52-b2ed-a45faef85eb1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4570037/terrance-ferguson\">Terrance Ferguson</a>, TE, <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"2e1473b2-e269-fd7a-1137-c1edacb85986\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Los Angeles Rams</a></h2><p>Let's connect some dots.

Even if they took a generational center with their top pick, there would still be concerns about losing a franchise cornerstone like that. But the position is now doubly tenuous with Ratledge as the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45459583/detroit-lions-offensive-line-frank-ragnow\">expected replacement</a>.</p><p>A high school tackle who played guard at Georgia, Ratledge only ever practiced at center in college -- he never saw game action there. There's a substantial increase in the mental ask for a center relative to guard, not to mention the mental leap from collegiate to professional play.

The veteran edge rusher <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/von-miller-to-sign-with-commanders-washington-bolsters-pass-rush-with-former-super-bowl-mvp/\" target=\"_blank\">signed a one-year deal with Washington</a></span> and is set to add to his already impressive career sack totals.  </p><p>Back in March, Miller's NFL future was up in the air when he was released by the <strong>Bills</strong> in order to save the team $8 million. In May, Miller said he had at least one more year left in him.  </p><p>\"I got this year on the books for sure, I'm going to play this coming up season,\" he said at he time. \"We'll just keep doing it one year at a time. If I had another great year this year, then I'll play the next year after that, but we'll just keep doing it one year at a time.\"  </p>\n        \n\n<p>Last season, Miller, 36, served a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy before totaling six sacks in 13 games. As things stand right now, Miller is 16th on the NFL's official all-time sack list. He's just three behind <strong>Lawrence Taylor</strong> and <strong>Leslie O'Neal</strong> for 14th all-time.  </p><p>Miller is a nice pick-up for the Commanders, but other teams have been busy improving their rosters this offseason.

</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pour a cup of coffee and keep them coming, golf fans. One of the biggest weekends of the year is here at The Open Championship, which will be underway by the time you read this.  </p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Rory McIlroy</strong>, however, isn't slated to tee off until 10:10 a.m. ET. That will give him plenty of time to think about <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/the-open-2025-rory-mcilroy-hopes-to-wash-away-difficult-2019-memories-in-quest-for-home-win-at-royal-portrush/\">what happened the last time The Open was in his home country</a> at Royal Portrush -- something he has probably tried to forget over the last six years.  </p><p>In 2019, McIlroy fired his opening tee shot out of bounds. The rest of his opening round didn't get any better, and he finished with a 79. Not even a terrific second-round score of 65 could keep him from missing the cut.  </p><p>This time is at least a little different. When McIlroy tees off today, he will have a career Grand Slam under his belt, and Patrick McDonald says that experience will serve him well.  </p>\n        \n\n<ul><li><strong>McDonald:</strong> <em>\"What memories McIlroy makes this week remain to be seen -- they will largely be dictated by his play and his responses to adversity -- but it is clear early on that he is embracing his place in the arena unlike last time when he chose to isolate.\"</em></li></ul><p>One of the people who won't be dwelling on McIlroy's 2019 failure is the native son himself. McIlroy is singularly focused on playing his game and soaking in the moment.  </p><p>\"The fact that I'm here at Portrush with the green jacket, having completed that lifelong dream, I want to do my best this week to enjoy everything that comes my way and enjoy the reaction of the fans and enjoy being in front of them and playing in front of them.\"  </p><p>Another high-profile golfer in pursuit of greatness is <strong>Scottie Scheffler</strong>, who will be <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/the-open-2025-scottie-schefflers-ascension-among-golfs-greats-would-continue-with-rare-two-major-season/\">hunting the rare two-major season</a>. In order to do that, Scheffler will need to beat his best Open finish of a seventh-place tie.  </p>\n        \n\n<p>As the weekend unfolds, CBS Sports will have you covered from wall to wall. For now, here are a handful of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/the-open-2025-bryson-dechambeau-among-five-major-champions-who-have-surprisingly-struggled-on-links-courses/\">major champions who have struggled on the links</a>, and here are the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-british-open-tv-schedule-coverage-channel-live-stream-where-to-watch-tee-times-at-royal-portrush/\">updated tee times and TV schedule</a>.  </p><h2>  🏀 Bradley Beal on the cusp of landing with Clippers  </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"untitled-design-2025-07-16t235148-060.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/17/23f14d89-16b0-4ff2-bbe2-7f9b2c671161/resize/670x377/7dcb19026120cba5d92cbbe6c66ada2e/untitled-design-2025-07-16t235148-060.png\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"377\" width=\"670\"></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>After getting bought out by the <strong>Suns</strong>, <strong>Bradley Beal </strong>found a new team at the speed of light. Once the buyout is finalized, Beal <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/clippers-to-sign-bradley-beal-to-two-year-deal-after-completion-of-contract-buyout-with-the-suns-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">will reportedly ink a two-year, $11 million deal</a></span> with the <strong>Clippers</strong>.  </p><p>Beal <em>was </em>set to make $53 million with Phoenix in the upcoming season, and that meant the trade market was drier than the Sonoran desert. Instead, the Suns chose to buy out Beal after a disappointing season in which he averaged 17.0 points, 3.7 assists and 3.3 rebounds across 53 games.  </p>\n        \n\n<p>That production may not be worth the astronomical payday he was supposed to get from the Suns, but this is more than a worthwhile gamble for the Clippers. As James Herbert writes, Beal was the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-bradley-beal-and-the-clippers-needed-each-other-after-veteran-flamed-out-with-suns/\" target=\"_blank\">right player at the right time (and the right price)</a></span> for Los Angeles.  </p><ul><li><strong>Herbert:</strong> <em>\"By adding the former All-Star on the cheap, the Clippers have found the scoring guard they needed and put together a roster that, on paper at least, can challenge the best of the West. It's an old team with health concerns, but it has the playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, rim protection and lineup versatility to be genuinely dangerous.\"</em></li></ul><h2>  🏈 SEC bold predictions  </h2><figure><p><img alt=\"brian-kelly-lsu.png\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/13/ba65a30f-f844-4232-8e15-c7a041db84c0/resize/670x377/486a4a77fc82686d484e696c699f5001/brian-kelly-lsu.png\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"377\" width=\"670\"></p><figcaption><span>\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>Talkin' season is in full effect as the SEC Media Days continue in Atlanta.

Alexander-Arnold prepared to take a corner kick and saw Barcelona were lackadaisical in setting up defensively, so he took advantage with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVK5HoZc-mI\" target=\"_blank\">a perfect whipped pass</a> to the feet of <a data-player-guid=\"3d886d42-f85b-d531-70f5-359a60cf92ac\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/182033/divock-origi\">Divock Origi</a> that decided the tie. Liverpool completed another one of their great Champions League escapes and advanced to the final, where they defeated <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f987a4b2-f3f9-e7f6-eb7d-eda43893be5a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=367\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> to win their sixth European crown.</p><p>In the years that followed, the success continued. Liverpool won two <a data-league-guid=\"6949f3af-300c-35f1-beab-b95669eedd38\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1\">Premier League</a> titles, made another Champions League final in 2022, and have largely been one of the best clubs in Europe since the latter 2010s. Alexander-Arnold was a large reason for that success, <a href=\"https://stathead.com/tiny/ySn6D\" target=\"_blank\">ranking third</a> in assists in the Premier League from 2018 through this past season. His ability to create in open play and from dead-ball situations as a full-back is game-breaking.</p><p>A talent of Alexander-Arnold's caliber doesn't come around often, and Liverpool were the beneficiaries at the senior level for nearly a decade. That's no longer the case, as he left Merseyside when his contract expired for a new challenge with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/fifa.cwc\">Club World Cup</a>, in which the Spanish giants were soundly defeated by <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/_/id/160/paris-saint-germain\">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in the semifinals, marked the beginning of a new chapter of the English star's career and we got an early glimpse of what he might bring to <a data-league-guid=\"cf7b0c51-7c48-3e9a-8abb-0c01b1a973a0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ESP.1\">LaLiga</a>.</p><p>But before we project what might come next season and beyond, it's important to first look back at Alexander-Arnold's journey in getting to this point.</p><hr><h2>The early days under Klopp</h2><p>The version of Liverpool which Jürgen Klopp took over and tried to mold early in his managerial tenure was far different to the iteration that later brought sustained success. Back then, Liverpool played a purer form of \"heavy metal football,\" which had taken the German league by storm when Klopp was at Borussia Dortmund. It was based on counterpressing, the act of swarming the opposition player after losing possession in order to win the ball back and prevent a counterattack.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45543115\" data-cerebro-id=\"6853f50fedba926edab0e017\" data-title=\"What Alonso needs to do to get the best out of Alexander-Arnold\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0619%2Fdm_250619_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_Alonso_needs_to_do_to_get_the_best_out_of_Alexander_Arnold_20250619_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250619_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_Alonso_needs_to_do_to_get_the_best_out_of_Alexander_Arnold_20250619_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0619%2Fdm_250619_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_Alonso_needs_to_do_to_get_the_best_out_of_Alexander_Arnold_20250619_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250619_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_Alonso_needs_to_do_to_get_the_best_out_of_Alexander_Arnold_20250619_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0619%2Fdm_250619_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_Alonso_needs_to_do_to_get_the_best_out_of_Alexander_Arnold_20250619_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250619_COM_SOC_Analysis_What_Alonso_needs_to_do_to_get_the_best_out_of_Alexander_Arnold_20250619_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45543115\">play</span><figcaption><p>2:34</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>What Alonso needs to do to get the best out of Alexander-Arnold</p><p>Gab &amp; Juls react to Trent Alexander-Arnold's Real Madrid debut at the Club World Cup.</p></div></div><p>With Dortmund and Liverpool in the early days under his stewardship, quickly turning defense into offense was crucial for generating high-quality chances. Klopp himself in the past <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvHT3BJu7g4\" target=\"_blank\">described counterpressing</a> as the best playmaker. Players such as <a data-player-guid=\"ea9705e7-d462-d183-e266-7fc6880a1534\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/93736/joe-allen\">Joe Allen</a> <a href=\"https://spielverlagerung.com/2016/07/15/tactical-analysis-jurgen-klopps-liverpool/\" target=\"_blank\">were vital</a> in those first few months while the club was establishing its tactical identity; Allen had the stamina and tactical awareness to win the ball often and help create fast attacks.</p><p>It made for some impressive and captivating victories in the Premier League: doing the double vs. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a> in 2015-16, the 5-4 thriller away at Norwich, a double against <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"feb44e87-58fa-9597-2691-b3c32768ebe4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=359\">Arsenal</a> in 2016-17, and a few blowout victories in Klopp's first 18 months. That focus on creating transitional moments through an aggressive out-of-possession approach also helped fuel Liverpool's run to the 2016 <a data-league-guid=\"ffe3e604-9c8d-38dc-ab82-c033a9112867\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/UEFA.EUROPA\">Europa League</a> final, which included another memorable Anfield comeback vs. Dortmund.</p><p>The downside was that when Liverpool played teams more willing to hunker down and force the Reds to play against a set defense, results were more mixed. For all the highs that Liverpool experienced, there were also many instances of not being able to break down stubborn low blocks in the league against clubs who didn't allow space into which Klopp's stars could attack. This led to many lost points over the course of a season, and a hard ceiling on their level of domestic success.</p><p>For Liverpool to graduate from a plucky but flawed side to a great team, both the personnel and the tactics had to evolve.</p><hr><h2>Alexander-Arnold's influence</h2><p>The rest of the 2010s saw Liverpool's attack rounded into form, largely thanks to smart recruitment and a bit of good fortune. The club acquired top-notch forward talent for relatively low transfer fees in <a data-player-guid=\"0a18a773-8594-8e1d-a614-a8274022110b\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/147234/roberto-firmino\">Roberto Firmino</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"36cf625e-f647-9120-d104-00d8a7a92f65\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/169797/sadio-mane\">Sadio Mané</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"49438d5e-de32-9f1b-9aab-5f6ae53f14d0\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/173896/mohamed-salah\">Mohamed Salah</a>. Signing <a data-player-guid=\"2ac3f3cf-816a-d765-a27a-4039ab6d6f13\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/104943/andrew-robertson\">Andrew Robertson</a> from Hull City in summer 2017 paid immediate dividends as he regularly started in both the league and the Champions League. Alexander-Arnold emerged from the club's academy as a teenager to also play consistent minutes, something you don't often see. Combine all of that, and you get the backbone of what ended up being one of the most captivating attacks in Europe.</p><p>In addition to the acquisitions, Liverpool altered their gameplan. To get the best out of Mané and Salah, Robertson and Alexander-Arnold became prominent parts of Liverpool's attack, pushing up and acting as wingers in a front five during settled possession in the opposition half. The midfield -- which included the likes of <a data-player-guid=\"1e734549-90ed-67fb-c947-344b9c52c9d1\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/176287/fabinho\">Fabinho</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"435e1a5a-d343-375b-817d-d67027e08385\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/127262/jordan-henderson\">Jordan Henderson</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"778dec0b-3a10-80b5-229a-7113d6e1f295\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/98342/georginio-wijnaldum\">Georginio Wijnaldum</a> -- would cover the spaces left behind, alongside a generational defender in <a data-player-guid=\"c350cf83-87c2-aedd-b25b-7e9f3f3fa4dd\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/157892/virgil-van-dijk\">Virgil van Dijk</a>. That version of Liverpool held up from 2018-20, before the addition of <a data-player-guid=\"d7f3bd44-c422-dd90-3b9e-3ac03ebcd6b3\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/135293/thiago-alcantara\">Thiago Alcantara</a> led to the midfield playing a greater role in the team's attack from 2021-23.</p><p>An easy way of seeing the full-backs' influence is to look at how cross-heavy Liverpool were during this period. Going back to the 2017-18 Premier League season; Stathead has the 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23 iterations of Liverpool in the top 10 for most crosses in a single season. This reconfiguration makes sense when accounting for just how much of an outlier Alexander-Arnold has been as a creator. According to FBref, he has been in the 90th percentile or higher in the league for a slew of passing and creation metrics on a per-90 basis, including expected assists, shot-creating actions and progressive passes from 2019 to 2025. In that span, Alexander-Arnold ranks fourth in the PL for total attacking sequence involvements ending in a shot, and 14th per 90 minutes for players with at least 10,000 minutes.</p><p>Few players in the history of the league have been as devastating a crosser as Alexander-Arnold. One name that comes to mind is David Beckham during his time with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6ebc2fd0-35d3-733b-5666-b75035a3bce9\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=360\">Manchester United</a>, an era when you were often aiming for one of two strikers in the box. A contemporary of Alexander-Arnold's, <a data-player-guid=\"c2bc0ee8-46fa-2189-ca21-014bc1c0e7e2\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/134947/kevin-de-bruyne\">Kevin De Bruyne</a> (who <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45331440/kevin-de-bruyne-joins-napoli-free-transfer-man-city-exit\">also departed the Premier League</a> for <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"20179aab-ac9f-93cf-f139-404e49a3f3cb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=114\">Napoli</a>) made <a href=\"https://www.thetransferflow.com/p/no-other-playmaker-has-ever-had-kevin-de-bruyne-s-skillset-c1c8\" target=\"_blank\">the right half-space</a> his office for many key passes and assists via crosses.</p><p>De Bruyne was a bigger threat to make runs into the wide zones of the box for square passes or cutbacks toward the middle, while Alexander-Arnold was a marvelous aerial passer from deeper areas. Both could hit off-ball runners at the far post with whipped deliveries that consistently hit the target, including in moments after a teammate wins the ball high and they get time on the ball to survey their options.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0714/r1519091_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>Alexander-Arnold was more than just a cross-spamming defender. He had great touch on diagonal switches of play that could discombobulate the opposition. Despite being a full-back, he was a threat to generate those high-value through balls you'd associate with a technical midfielder. The off-the-ball movement was a lesser part of his game compared with others at his position, but he was no slouch there, either. In particular, he could make himself available for short switches near the box that helped amplify his passing.</p><p>Progressive carries under duress and one-on-one dribbling were not major hallmarks of his game, but the passing was so overwhelming that it ultimately didn't matter. The heat map below from 2019 to 2022 shows the greatest concentration just inside the opposition half, where Alexander-Arnold would regularly attempt crosses or look to switch the play.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0714/r1519093_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>This period was a perfect marriage between Alexander-Arnold's unique skill set and Liverpool's attack being more unpredictable than most top sides' at the time. They were comfortable playing a more vertical game, because in addition to Mané and Salah being the rare attackers who were both technically and physically dominant, Alexander-Arnold was more than willing to service them with a variety of passes from different angles.</p><hr><h2>The inverted full-back experiment</h2><p>Toward the end of the 2022-23 season, an interesting pattern emerged. Liverpool were experiencing a decline in form compared to previous campaigns, ultimately missing out on Champions League qualification -- something that hadn't happened since Klopp was hired in October 2015. Opponents were better prepared to game-plan against Liverpool's base attack, and combined with the midfield core ageing out of their respective primes, they were more susceptible to <a href=\"https://theanalyst.com/articles/what-went-wrong-for-liverpool-in-2022-23\" target=\"_blank\">transition attacks</a>. While Liverpool had always given up high-quality chances on average in the past (an inevitability for proactive defensive sides), creating high turnovers helped keep the volume down and the math on their side. That wasn't the case in 2022-23.</p><p>As such, Klopp made the interesting decision to move Alexander-Arnold more centrally as part of a double pivot. The idea of full-backs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk05PKO6v2M\">moving inward</a> as a midfielder in possession had become en vogue as a method of asserting control. Why? Because by overloading the middle, you're more likely to progress between the lines. If the opposition tries to combat that with a more narrow out-of-possession structure, there's easier access to the flanks. While Alexander-Arnold previously had license to roam inward when needed, he tended to operate like a typical marauding full-back during the 2010s. With Liverpool no longer controlling matches like they had in previous seasons, changing his role was worth a try.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0714/r1519095_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>The results were instant. From the March international break until the end of the season, Liverpool were tied for third in points per match. Their <a href=\"https://understat.com/league/EPL/2022\" target=\"_blank\">underlying numbers</a> were what you'd expect from a top-four side, an upgrade over their performance for most of the season before the change, but still below the previous season.</p><p>The 2023-24 campaign was even more promising, with Liverpool being in the heart of the title race for long stretches. If not for Salah's injury and downturn of form after the 2024 <a data-league-guid=\"bb156ba1-46ad-7892-2b1c-afb73035e08f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/CAF.NATIONS\">Africa Cup of Nations</a>, it's possible their 20th league title would've come a year earlier than it did.</p><p>What made Alexander-Arnold's interpretation of the inverted full-back role interesting was that while he became more meticulous with the tempo of his passing, he still often showed the directness we came to associate with him. By contrast, someone like <a data-player-guid=\"e2ea8b55-6695-7646-35db-c41fd3bfdb38\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/217482/oleksandr-zinchenko\">Oleksandr Zinchenko</a> would <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrjr0ekugjI&amp;t=404s\" target=\"_blank\">look to circulate possession</a>, show fluid positioning off the ball, and act as a decoy. Alexander-Arnold would constantly look to spray passes forward <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnI0Hm6a_jk&amp;t=369s\" target=\"_blank\">like a deep-lying playmaker</a>, whether between the lines or over the top of the opposition defensive line. More than anything, his presence through the middle was to help create more transitional moments, which fitted the club's M.O. In the 2023-24 season, Alexander-Arnold was sixth in the Premier League for total through balls completed, <a href=\"https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/2023-2024/passing_types/2023-2024-Premier-League-Stats\" target=\"_blank\">according to FBref</a>, with no other defender coming close in the rankings.</p><p>It's fair to say Alexander-Arnold performed admirably during this stretch and remained a dynamic playmaker, but the new usage wasn't without its faults. In particular, he wasn't the most graceful under pressure, and his back-to-goal play was a mixed bag, making him more vulnerable to pressing than midfielders or even select inverted full-backs. This led to Klopp trying to get him in more situations facing forward outside the opposition block when receiving centrally as the 2023-24 season progressed.</p><hr><h2>Swansong under Slot</h2><p>The 2024-25 season saw Alexander-Arnold return more to the role he had in earlier years. A greater proportion of his open play touches were from the right flank, and he wasn't trying to moonlight as a pivot operator quite so often. While he still did have more license to roam centrally compared to his earlier years, it was more measured and selective.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0714/r1519097_1200x800_3-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>Liverpool under manager Arne Slot last season were a bit different compared with Klopp's team. The Dutch coach prioritized a greater emphasis on control through building up centrally, including the times when Liverpool would attempt to bait the press in the hopes of creating artificial transitions. In settled possession, they would often have four behind the ball during buildup with either a single midfielder or double pivot in place. The midfield trio of Ryan Gravenberch, <a data-player-guid=\"7e22516b-6c44-1ecd-b8a0-c34530c8e242\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/249299/alexis-mac-allister\">Alexis Mac Allister</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"fab1b006-532b-8133-de47-647e95a46877\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257206/dominik-szoboszlai\">Dominik Szoboszlai</a> was a massive change from what Liverpool had in previous years, and it was the bedrock for playing through the opposition. In early phases of possession, Alexander-Arnold himself would often be the most advanced of the back four, which would resemble an L-shape.</p><p>This had a knock-on effect in which Alexander-Arnold's attacking gifts were used less often and he wasn't quite the creative hub he had been in prior seasons. His <a href=\"https://fbref.com/tiny/BXTr8\" target=\"_blank\">stats</a> showed a noticeable reduction, as others in the squad took up more responsibilities. There was a greater level of caution in his approach, in line with the overall tactics.</p><p>There were still moments where Alexander-Arnold's passing helped swing matches. He had a late secondary assist to help Liverpool draw at Arsenal in October via a perfectly weighted lob in behind to <a data-player-guid=\"c56f203e-3b2f-5384-116c-c5fb3781e120\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/271788/darwin-nunez\">Darwin Núñez</a>. In Liverpool's 6-3 victory over <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"f987a4b2-f3f9-e7f6-eb7d-eda43893be5a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=367\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> during the Christmas period, he delivered an inch-perfect cross to <a data-player-guid=\"9959537e-af42-929e-a829-cc149924d7f4\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/257390/luis-diaz\">Luis Díaz</a> for the opening goal. In the 90th minute away versus <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"0446e7fd-7655-f17a-d282-8c401b808d1f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=337\">Brentford</a> in January, Alexander-Arnold's underlapping run into the wide right zone of the box and eventual low cross was met by Núñez to break the deadlock in what ended up being a 2-0 win.</p><p>If Slot-ball made Alexander-Arnold a slightly more peripheral figure in attack, it helped mitigate his defensive shortcomings. Alexander-Arnold was never a net positive on defense for a variety of reasons, including athletic deficiencies defending in one-vs.-ones and a lack of off-the-ball awareness. The combination of having more players behind the ball during buildup, and Liverpool primarily defending in a 4-2-4 shape out of possession to limit central progression, helped mitigate some of the concerns.</p><hr><h2>Taking on a new challenge in Spain</h2><p>Once it became clear Alexander-Arnold would sign with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"66434654-a8ba-a04c-98e5-6bbd0dbbb780\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=86\">Real Madrid</a>, there was considerable intrigue about how he'd fit into their starting XI. This was especially true once Xabi Alonso became the club's manager.</p><p>What we did know from Alonso's time with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"483ec574-cb09-6d8f-e308-302d5d695d70\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=131\">Bayer Leverkusen</a> was his insistence on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYBTQclvjNs\" target=\"_blank\">controlling matches</a>, not from a dogmatic adherence to formation or structure, but instead having clear principles both in and out of possession. From there, it's adapting to the skill sets available to him within the squad so they can problem-solve on the fly over the course of 90 minutes.</p><p>Some thought there could be initial synergy found with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/252107/vinicius-junior\">Vinícius Júnior</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231388/kylian-mbappe\">Kylian Mbappé</a>. Those two are some of the best in the world at puncturing high defensive lines through straight-line movements in behind the opposition. They could take advantage of long aerials directed their way, especially in moments of controlled chaos from high turnovers or second-ball regains. Whenever Alexander-Arnold takes up aggressive positions against a low block, <a data-player-guid=\"4596832d-d906-4ce5-b3b4-eee94499abad\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/235818/federico-valverde\">Federico Valverde</a> can help cover for him defensively due to his impressive ground coverage.</p><p>The Club World Cup gave us a very early look into Alexander-Arnold's potential role with Real Madrid. There were some clunky moments during the early stages of buildup, including Alexander-Arnold not cleanly receiving with his back to goal and allowing incoming pressure. He also occasionally missed straightforward short-range passes toward the double pivot in space to help progress play.</p><p>Once Real Madrid made it to the opposition half, Alexander-Arnold was much more of a peripheral figure compared to previous years -- especially under Klopp. He largely stuck to providing width along the right flank, with occasional underlapping runs in the right channel. The lack of runners into the box made it tougher for him to connect on his famous crosses.</p><p>In general, the slow tempo in attack and the lack of opportunities to play in chaos moments also took away some of what made Alexander-Arnold special in the Premier League. Without being such a cheat code in possession, it amplified some of the defensive worries. His high positioning prevented him from helping effectively in the counterpress, and some indecision in situations when they're trying to trap the opposition near their own box.</p><p>This isn't to say that there weren't bright moments during the Club World Cup. Alexander-Arnold's crossing was accurate and sharp in Madrid's group stage victory vs. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"dde04f24-2c69-420c-96af-9cde73ef3f6f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2790\">RB Salzburg</a>. He had the assist for Madrid's goal in their 1-0 round-of-16 victory over <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"87fe4844-a7cf-c88e-2ebe-aeb57325e990\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=111\">Juventus</a>, which came from an improvised underlapping run into the box that set up a short-range driven cross.</p><p>It should be noted that we're talking about a handful of matches during what was essentially a preseason tournament, so taking a ton from it would be unwise. However, it would be fair to suggest that there could be some growing pains in Year 1.</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45712452\" data-cerebro-id=\"687046edac2b6424ea62d3bb\" data-title=\"Bale: Mbappé critcism due to Real Madrid's lack of trophies\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0710%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL%2Fdm_250710_COM_SOC_Analysis_Bale_Mbappe_critcism_due_to_Real_Madrids_lack_of_trophies_20250710_GLOBAL.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45712452\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:34</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Bale: Mbappé critcism due to Real Madrid's lack of trophies</p><p>Gareth Bale backs Xabi Alonso to get the best out of Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid's other attacking talents.</p></div></div><hr><h2>A lasting legacy, and what he'll do in Madrid</h2><p>For the past handful of seasons, warts and all, Alexander-Arnold has been one of the best players in the world. It's very rare that a full-back can be the leading or co-leading playmaker for one of the most dynamic attacks in the world over a multi-year stretch, which was the case with Liverpool. Having such an outsized impact in the final third more than made up for the drawbacks he had defensively, which included athletic limitations in one-vs.-one situations and being guilty of ball-watching. This helps explain why all-in-one metrics, such as Donald Cayton's <a href=\"http://www.gamemodelsfootball.com/ratings/mbappe-ratings/Trent-%25Alexander-Arnold-1998\" target=\"_blank\">MBAPPE model</a>, consistently rated him highly over the years. That level of impact is what Real Madrid will hope to see from Alexander-Arnold as the club seeks to bounce back from a very disappointing campaign in which they finished second in LaLiga and were bounced from the Champions League in the quarterfinals.</p><p>In theory, adding a player of his caliber as a free agent should be additive. However, we've seen over the years (such as with Real Madrid) that simply stacking talented players on top of each other doesn't necessarily make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p>Part of getting the best out of Alexander-Arnold will mean creating more of the controlled chaotic situations he thrived in with Liverpool. It could be very difficult given LaLiga's slower pace of play. Those dynamic situations would not only benefit him, but also others such as Mbappé and Vinícius. Trying to find a balance between embracing chaos and controlled possession, while also attempting to create a functional defensive unit, will define Alonso's tenure as Real Madrid's manager.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see what happens with Alexander-Arnold once he begins life in Spain. He could benefit from LaLiga being a less physically demanding league than the Premier League, but he'll also face a ton of low defensive blocks and potentially less situations against unsettled oppositions. Replicating what he accomplished in England will be a tall task, as he won all the major trophies possible with Liverpool. All the while, he accomplished that through an atypical style of play that transformed him into the team's quarterback in attack, a rare feat given the position he plays.</p><p>Trent Alexander-Arnold left the Premier League as one of its best players ever. Whether he can reach similar heights in LaLiga as a Real Madrid player will be fascinating to watch.</p>\n</div></div>"

His job allows him to be creative while balancing what athletes want to eat and what they need to perform at the top level. </p><p>\"We use the expression to a lot of the student athletes here that they bring their backpack full of tools with them,\" Johnson told CBS Sports. \"...We are going to unpack all of that and put the good stuff back in, and put better things in where the tools have gone dull, so to speak.\" </p><p>Johnson and his team do an eight-week cycle menu to avoid food jags. Some of the things that are consistent are deep fried foods on Mondays, and steak nights on Wednesdays -- which naturally leads to one of the busiest nights of the week. </p><p>Breakfast is from 6:30 a.m. to 10- ish, emphasis on the \"ish\" because the kitchen staff does not want athletes to go to practice hungry. Lunch is from 11 a.m. until around 2 p.m., and dinner goes from 5 p.m. until at least 7:30 p.m. </p>\n        \n\n<p>Athletes are in constant communication with their dietician to make sure they are following one of three plans: the gain program, maintenance program or lean program. Johnson then works with the dieticians to create a menu that will suit the different needs. </p><p>Johnson's first experience working with performance nutrition was at T-Mobile Park with the Seattle Mariners. His impressive resume also includes the Seattle Seahawks, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Olympics and even the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food/news/a38947/guinness-world-record-set-largest-plate-nachos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2012 Guinness Book of World Records for largest nacho</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>Here are some of his most memorable experiences as a chef: </p><h2> Luaus and Burrow's pot roast: Team Takeover nights </h2><p>Once or twice a month, LSU does a Team Takeover Night in which a specific team sits down with the chefs to create a menu. It is often more expensive than one of the usual menus because the teams try to compete against each other and don't hold back with requests. These range from ordering jerk seasoning straight from Jamaica, to doing a whole pig Luau -- back when defensive tackle Breiden Fehoko, who hails from Hawaii, was in Baton Rouge.&nbsp; </p>\n        \n\n<p>Team Takeover Nights used to be Taste of Home Nights, which celebrated a specific regional area. For example, here's what a Taste of Home Night looked like when the menu was made to honor the fare of Southern Louisiana.&nbsp;</p><table>   <thead><tr><th>Meal</th><th>What's Cookin</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Lunch</td><td>         Berbere Shrimp &amp; Grits<br>         Slow‑Cooked Smoked Pork<br>         Black‑Eyed Pea Hummus<br>         Roasted Candy‑Striped Beets<br>         Smothered Cabbage<br>         Grilled Corn<br>         Carolina Gold Rice<br>         Cheddar Mac &amp; Cheese<br>         Corn Muffins<br>         Seafood Bisque       </td></tr><tr><td>Dinner</td><td>         Smothered Turkey Necks<br>         Watermelon‑Brined Fried Chicken<br>         Smothered Seitan &amp; Mushrooms<br>         Vegetable Medley<br>         Braised Greens<br>         Black‑Eyed Peas<br>         Sweet Potato Casserole<br>         Charleston Gold Rice<br>         Corn Muffins       </td></tr></tbody></table><p>One of the most memorable ones for Johnson happened in 2019 in honor of a well-known athlete who was born in Ames, Iowa.&nbsp; </p><p>\"We did one specifically for the Midwest and Joe Burrow was from the Midwest. Realistically, it was for his family,\" Johnson said. \"Typically, we didn't do it for just one athlete, but for Joe Burrow we did.\" </p>\n        \n\n<p>Burrow's family came for the special occasion and created a menu with typical midwestern dishes such as pot roast and stew.&nbsp; </p><h2> The whisper before the Heisman </h2><p>Johnson remembers taking a photo with Burrow, his dad, cousin and coach Ed Orgeron during that Taste of Home Night. As he was walking away, Orgeron told Johnson to remember this moment. </p><p>\"Coach O grabbed me by the shoulder, pulled me in and said, 'you might want to hold on to that one son, because that's going to be our next Heisman trophy winner,'\" Johnson recalled. \"It was in like, September or October, well before the hunt for the trophy had started, and Coach O had called it. He whispered it in my ear and lo and behold, we had this extraordinary year. Coach saw something there that I don't think anybody else saw and it was incredible.\" </p>\n        \n\n<p>A few months later, Burrow won the Heisman trophy by the largest margin in the history of the award and became the most decorated player in LSU football history. To this day, that is still one of Johnson's favorite photos.&nbsp; </p><figure>\n    \n</figure>\n<h2> PB&amp;Js and Paul Allen's secret dive mission </h2><p>Before LSU, Johnson worked for the Seahawks at Lumen Field. His team had to feed everybody in the stadium, which meant 70,000 people on game day including the players, cheerleaders, people in the suites and even security. </p><p>He had to cook everything from hot dogs to filet mignon, but despite the variety in his kitchen, the excitement didn't always show in what the players were eating. At the professional level, Johnson explained, a lot of athletes are very much set in their ways.&nbsp; </p>\n        \n\n<p>\"We had a couple of guys who wouldn't eat anything other than grilled chicken breast and tuna sandwiches,\" Johnson said. \"We fed them PB &amp; J sandwiches, sugary sweets and bone broth on game day, but we didn't do a whole lot on game day.\" </p><p>One of this most memorable experiences with the team happened on the day he was set to meet owner Paul Allen. The co-founder of Microsoft had a team of private chefs who traveled around the world with him, which meant Johnson was not going to have a lot of interaction with him. However, Johnson befriended one of Allen's chefs, Chet Wallenstein, who convinced Allen to let Johnson cook for his suite one day.&nbsp; </p><p>That much awaited moment didn't go as planned, but it's one Johnson will never forget. </p>\n        \n\n<p>\"We are presenting the food, laying it down and Chet was going to introduce me to him. Paul was glued to his Microsoft tablet. He was intensely looking at this thing,\" Johnson said. \"Chet looked at me and said, not a good day, let's just go. I was like, ok no worries. Who am I to tell Paul Allen he needs to turn around and meet me, right?\" </p><p>A few days later, Johnson found out he was in the room while history was being made. </p><p>\"(Wallenstein) says, 'you are never going to believe this, but when you were about to walk up to him and shake his hand, he was actually watching live footage of an underwater research vessel that was going to the bottom of the Pacific.' They found the USS Indianapolis and he funded that. He was watching live footage of his research vessel finding the USS Indianapolis.\" </p>\n        \n\n<h2> Cooking for a President: A venison showdown at the Olympics </h2><p>Johnson worked the 2010 Vancouver Olympics but didn't get to watch a lot of the games because he had a lot of action happening in his own kitchen. His team was in charge of suites, including those that housed some of the most powerful people in the world. He said there were about 4,000 dignitaries, from the crown prince of Dubai to former President George W. Bush.&nbsp; </p><p>\"These are not people that you can take lightly,\" Johnson said. \"As a matter of fact, I had an international health department gentleman following me around during the preparation of one of those days, because they have to.\" </p><p>The inspector was supposed to follow him for eight hours on the first day, but he had seen enough to trust Johnson after only three hours and decided to leave early. That compliment boosted Johnson's confidence, which he was going to need for opening ceremonies the following day.&nbsp; </p>\n        \n\n<p>Johnson saw the inspector again and was instructed to cook venison for Bush's suite at exactly 165 degrees, which is significantly higher than the temperature required for a medium-rare finish. The chef had so far followed all the protocols, but he had to speak out against this one. </p><p>\"I was like, oh my God brother, this is my time to shine and you want me to cook venison to 165 degrees? It's going to come out like jerky,\" he said. \"Venison is lean. What are we doing here? He kind of looked at me and said, 'let me call my boss.'\" </p><p>The inspector walked far away, but Johnson could see him staring while making the phone call. After an intense couple of minutes, Johnson was granted permission to cool the venison to 145 degrees -- as long as the inspector watched it closely. </p>\n        \n\n<p>\"This is a man of international integrity watching over the most important people in the world so we don't make them sick, and he just gave me the green light to cook to 145 degrees,\" Johnson said. \"That was one of the most memorable experiences at the Olympics.\" </p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

On the plus side, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murray/\">Kyler Murray</a> played his first full season since 2020. On the downside, the defense gave up at least 30 points five times, including to offenses like Seattle and Carolina down the stretch.</p><p>The team spent the offseason focusing on improving the defensive side of the ball to ideally erase those big point totals allowed on the scoreboard. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179277/josh-sweat/\">Josh Sweat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2000919/dalvin-tomlinson/\">Dalvin Tomlinson</a> each got big deals to come to Arizona and shore up the front seven along with old friend <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/520548/calais-campbell/\">Calais Campbell</a>, who was selected in the second round of the draft by the Cardinals all the way back in 2008. The Cardinals then spent their first five draft picks on defense, including adding <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28923687/walter-nolen/\">Walter Nolen</a> to make up the final piece of the completely redone interior of the defensive line and landing draft slider <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/517294/will-johnson/\">Will Johnson</a> in the second round to step in at cornerback. Throw in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139625/budda-baker/\">Budda Baker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2829831/zaven-collins/\">Zaven Collins</a> and 2024 breakout <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126891/garrett-williams/\">Garrett Williams</a>, and the defense appears stocked with talent.</p><p>While the offense only added at the margins, it could also see an uptick with growth from 2024 first-round pick <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701883/marvin-harrison-jr/\">Marvin Harrison Jr.</a>, whose rookie season likely qualifies as a disappointment with only 62 receptions for 885 yards despite scoring eight times. While Harrison delivered a couple big performances, he was held under 40 yards seven times during the season, and while tight end <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2963385/trey-mcbride/\">Trey McBride</a> looks more than capable of being a No. 1 weapon if needed, the rest of the wide receiver depth chart doesn't leave much room for optimism if Harrison and Murray can't connect more consistently. But if the pairing can figure it out, the Cardinals have a better chance than you might think of being a surprise division winner.</p><p>We're going to take a quick look at the Cardinals' 2024 season and the rest of their offseason moves before getting into their track record in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> futures over the last five years. After that, you can find the odds available at top <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\">sportsbooks</a> for their 2025 win total along with <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> and playoff odds as well as key player props to know.

The remade defensive line should be one of the bigger improvements for any position group in the league, and Will Johnson was once considered a top-five pick before missing half of last season with an injury that appeared to limit him in the predraft process. It's a big talent upgrade for a unit that finished middle of the back in scoring last year, putting a top-10 or even top-five finish this year in the potential range of outcomes.</p><p>The offense didn't add any new projected starters, but it has slowly come together over the last few years and turned into an above-average unit. Paris Johnson had a breakout season as the team's left tackle, joining Kyler Murray, Trey McBride and Marvin Harrison Jr. as cornerstone pieces for the long-term future, while the rushing attack finished second in yards per carry last year. Offensive coordinator Drew Petzing is a rising star who could be on a head-coaching track if he can solve the issues with Harrison's disappointing rookie campaign.</p><h2>Reasons to fade the Cardinals</h2><p>While there's reason to be excited about the defense, it will have to make do without <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2188984/sean-murphy-bunting/\">Sean Murphy-Bunting</a> after the cornerback suffered a knee injury that will leave him sidelined all season. That puts more pressure on Will Johnson to prove he's healthy and can be effective as a starter out the gate, while 2024 second-round pick <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3177371/max-melton/\">Max Melton</a> will have to take a step forward to give the pass defense a chance at success. Better pressure up front should help after the defense finished near the bottom of the league in pressure rate last year.</p><p>The Cardinals do play in one of the toughest divisions in football with six games against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a>, and their third-place finish won't even afford them help in their slate of non-common opponents, which are made up by the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a>. The good news is that they'll get to face the NFC South and AFC South, but they're going to need to step up against playoff-caliber teams in order to make it to the postseason.</p><h2>How to bet the Cardinals in 2025</h2><ul><li><strong>Over 8.5 wins -115 (DraftKings)</strong></li><li><strong>Kyler Murray Under 500.5 rushing yards -110 (BetMGM)</strong></li></ul><p>I'm a big fan of how the Cardinals attacked the offseason and I see their defense as having potential to be among the most surprising units in the league thanks to all the additions they made up front. With an above-average offense and defense, I expect the Cardinals to not have much issue with the AFC South and NFC South, and I think there's even a chance they could win all eight of those games, though road trips to both Houston and Tampa make that unlikely. At any rate, this feels like a nine-win team that could be much closer to the Rams than futures odds suggest.</p><p>The hedge on the Cardinals Over is Kyler Murray staying under 500.5 rushing yards, though I think that could happen even if he plays all 17 games. He's starting to get to the point of his career at age 28 where he should look to take less hits by keeping his scrambling more in check, and the presence of two big weapons in Trey McBride and Marvin Harrison Jr. should make his first priority throwing the ball more than it has been in the past. We may have seen that start to manifest last season, when he had 45+ rushing yards in five of his first seven games and only twice after that start. A player would get to 510 rushing yards by averaging 30 per game, and Murray's average has been right around that in two of his last four seasons, but I could see it dip slightly lower this season. And of course, If he misses any time, I think this prop has a great chance of coming in.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

While the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/rankings/scnext300boys/_/view/rn300\">2026 ESPN 300</a> and <a href=\"http://espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/rankings/scnext300boys/_/class/2027/order/true\">2027 ESPN Junior 300</a> are both well represented, we also dipped into the rising sophomore 2028 class.</p><p>We've seen these high-level prospects compete in scouting camp settings and on film since February. This list blends the eye test, character traits, on-field production and combine testing data with assessments on how all of those variables will come together to deliver future impact on Saturdays.</p><p>Let's dive in.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256474/lamar-brown\">Lamar Brown</a>, DT | LSU commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 ranking:</strong> 1</p><p>How are these for measurables? Brown stands 6-foot-5, 285 pounds and runs a 4.85 40-yard dash, which matches the second-fastest time among defensive tackles at last year's NFL combine. A legitimate prospect on either side of the line, Brown is the top-ranked recruit in 2026 with rare range and mobility. For now, the LSU commit plans to start his college career on defense. He moves extremely well and plays with excellent leverage, balance and finishing power for a player his size. Brown has immense upside.</p><hr><h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/265643/kennedy-brown\">Kennedy Brown</a>, OT | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>2027 ESPN Junior 300 ranking:</strong> 1</p><p>Brown has the tools to become one of the best offensive tackle prospects in recent memory. Don't let his 6-4 height fool you. The top prospect in the 2027 class boasts a 7-foot wingspan and massive 11-inch hands, both of which would have ranked at the top of last year's marks among offensive linemen at the NFL combine. Brown likely isn't done growing, which could help address his need to add weight. Brown's athleticism already stands out. He's light on his feet with good body quickness, bend and, at times, effortless pass protection. His physical upside is through the roof.</p><hr><h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259636/zion-elee\">Zion Elee</a>, DE | Maryland commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 ranking:</strong> 2</p><p>The in-state Maryland commit is arguably the most athletic edge rusher we have ever evaluated. His 4.43 40-yard dash would place him in the top 5% all time at the NFL combine for defensive ends. At 6-4 with an 80-inch wingspan, Elee is long, lean and explosive, with plenty of room to add more bulk. That length, paired with an excellent first step and strong motor, wreaks havoc off the edge. He broad-jumped more than 11 feet this spring, the highest ever recorded on the Under Armour Camp Series platform. Elee will be an instant impact college defender in fall 2026.</p><hr><h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256477/jackson-cantwell\">Jackson Cantwell</a>, OT | Miami commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 ranking:</strong> 3</p><p>Cantwell, a two-time state champion shot putter who holds multiple national high school throwing records, has the prototypical measurables of a first-round NFL tackle. The Miami commit stands 6-7, 320 pounds with plenty of athleticism and flexibility. He has excellent feet in pass protection but is even more advanced as a run blocker, showing powerful hands and the ability to finish at the point of attack. He's a plug-and-play type in Coral Gables and could ultimately replace 2023 five-star lineman <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/246626/francis-mauigoa\">Francis Mauigoa</a>, who is projected as a high first-round NFL draft pick in 2026.</p><hr><h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256605/dia-bell\">Dia Bell</a>, QB | Texas commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 4</p><p>The son of 12-year NBA veteran Raja Bell, Dia Bell is coming off a win at Elite 11 this summer and has a long track record of production. He's a three-year starter at national power American Heritage, where he threw for 2,597 yards and 29 touchdowns while completing 70.6% of his passes last fall as a junior before suffering a season-ending leg injury. The Texas commit is quite similar to <a data-player-guid=\"d499f837-dace-3ada-8168-eaaa41b706e3\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4870906/arch-manning\">Arch Manning</a>. He's a talented passer with smooth mechanics and a quiet, steely confidence. Bell can extend plays and work through his progressions, and he's a better athlete and runner than former Longhorns starter Quinn Ewers.</p><blockquote>— Billy Tucker (@TheUCReport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheUCReport/status/1935362807270359184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <hr><h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256276/chris-henry-jr\">Chris Henry Jr</a>., WR | Ohio State commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 5</p><p>Henry has been committed to Ohio State for three years, the longest-running commitment in the country among ESPN 300 prospects, and dominated as an underclassman before a knee injury sidelined him for most of his junior season. The 6-5 elite playmaker caught 71 passes for more than 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns as a sophomore and is a matchup nightmare for corners because of his frame. With a 78.4-inch wingspan, Henry can simply outreach defenders and haul in passes with his elite hands. And while most receivers his size struggle to accelerate to full speed, Henry has clocked a 4.59 laser-timed 40-yard dash. His rare combination of size, speed and athleticism makes him the top receiver in the country.</p><hr><h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260408/jamier-brown\">Jamier Brown</a>, WR | Ohio State commit</h2><p><strong>2027 ESPN Junior 300 rank:</strong> 2</p><p>Yes, the Buckeyes have the top receiving prospect in each of the next two classes. Brown has NFL-caliber burst off the line and frequently beats defenses over the top. Undersized at 5-11, 170 pounds, his speed is his greatest asset; Brown has run a 4.49 laser-timed 40-yard dash and a 10.15-second 100-meter dash. He has smooth feet and clearly understands how to run excellent routes. Brown's off-ball acceleration and downfield speed make him a matchup nightmare for any defender who falls even half a step behind.</p><hr><h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256473/jared-curtis\">Jared Curtis</a>, QB | Georgia commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 6</p><p>Curtis checks every box from a measurables standpoint. He's 6-3, 225 pounds with coveted arm strength and impressive speed for his size. He has put it all on tape, too, showing the ability to evade defenders and make difficult throws inside and outside the pocket. Curtis is so dominant at the high school level that he doesn't need to run often, but the hallmarks of a dual-threat quarterback are clearly there. He's plenty confident as well, entering a crowded quarterback room at Georgia that features multiple former elite prospects.</p><hr><h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261586/john-meredith-iii\">John Meredith III</a>, CB | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>2027 ESPN Junior 300 rank:</strong> 3</p><p>Meredith is the highest-rated defensive player in the junior class, with the tools to impact a game in all phases. He settled in at cornerback this season, emerging as a dynamic playmaker with excellent ball instincts. At 6-2 with a 78-inch wingspan and a lightning-fast 4.42 40-yard dash, he has all the markers of an elite corner. Now that he's locked into a position, we're eager to see how he continues to develop. Meredith has every chance to solidify his status as the top defensive player in the country.</p><hr><h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/265138/zyron-forstall\">Zyron Forstall</a>, DE | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>2027 ESPN Junior 300 rank:</strong> 4</p><p>Forstall is the second-highest-rated defender in the ESPN Junior 300, but the 6-4, 235-pound end already looks like he belongs on a Power 4 roster. He's an explosive edge defender with a wide frame who overwhelms offensive tackles when he gets off the ball. His bend and relentless pursuit lead to game-changing plays and pop on tape. With good hands, a high football IQ and positional versatility, Forstall projects as a true three-down defender capable of lining up at multiple spots. He's only getting bigger and stronger, so don't be surprised if he makes a push for the No. 1 spot with a dominant fall.</p><hr><h2>11. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259293/derrek-cooper\">Derrek Cooper</a>, RB | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 7</p><p>Cooper is the highest-rated running back in the country and was an offensive force for national powerhouse Chaminade-Madonna College Prep, leading his team to a Florida 1A state championship with more than 1,000 yards, 14 touchdowns and key contributions at linebacker on defense. At 6-1, 205 pounds, Cooper has the strength and explosiveness to burst through holes and bounce off defenders. His athleticism also shows up on defense, where he uses his straight-line speed to roam sideline to sideline. His remarkable two-way impact against the best competition in Florida explains why he's one of the best offensive prospects in the 2026 class.</p><hr><h2>12. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256539/faizon-brandon\">Faizon Brandon</a>, QB | Tennessee commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 8</p><p>Brandon picks apart defenses with precision. The Tennessee commit threw for more than 2,100 yards, 27 touchdowns and had just one interception as a junior. The 6-4 quarterback shows strong pocket presence on film and delivers an excellent deep ball. Brandon processes defenses and reads the entire field quickly, especially on broken plays, which helps him limit turnovers. His decision-making and ability to push the ball downfield make him a strong fit for Josh Heupel's offense.</p><hr><h2>13. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261983/brysen-wright\">Brysen Wright</a>, WR | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>Class of 2028</strong></p><p>At 6-4, 215 pounds, the Jacksonville product out of Mandarin High School is remarkably physical for his age. Many in Florida eagerly anticipated his debut, and he delivered with 31 catches for 646 yards and 8 touchdowns in just 11 games. On tape, Wright flashes a rare combination for a freshman: an 80.1-inch wingspan, a huge catch radius, fluid movement and rapid acceleration off the line. Add in his 4.61 laser-timed 40-yard dash, and he's a playmaker in both the short and vertical passing game. Wright should only get faster as he gets older, and he could become the best player in the 2028 class.</p><hr><h2>14. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261599/eric-mcfarland-iii\">Eric McFarland III</a>, WR | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>Class of 2028</strong></p><p>Don't count McFarland out of the race for the No. 1 spot in the 2028 class. He ran a stunning 4.37 laser-timed 40-yard dash at just 14 years old, and the slot receiver already uses his burst and smooth top-end speed to separate himself from opposing -- and often older -- defenders. McFarland also has great ball skills, consistently hauling in passes outside the framework of his body. He's undersized at 5-8, 165 pounds, but he has plenty of time to develop while maintaining elite speed and athleticism. He's primed for an explosive sophomore season catching passes from Dia Bell on one of the best high school teams in the country at American Heritage.</p><hr><h2>15. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261488/ladamion-guyton\">LaDamion Guyton</a>, OLB | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>2027 ESPN Junior 300 rank:</strong> 5</p><p>At 6-3, 210 pounds, Guyton already has an impressive physique and athleticism off the edge. He overwhelms offensive tackles with a combination of force, strength and fast, powerful hands. Guyton often opts for power instead of finesse, content to run right through blockers to punish quarterbacks. He's explosive in pursuit of the ball, which is backed up by his 11.5-second 100-meter dash. With 16 sacks through his first two high school seasons, Guyton is a proven playmaker. Whether he ultimately profiles as a traditional outside linebacker or edge defender, he's only going to get bigger and stronger.</p><hr><h2>16. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259587/jayden-wade\">Jayden Wade</a>, QB | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>Class of 2028</strong></p><p>One of the youngest prospects on this list, Wade has a promising future ahead. At 6-3, 175 pounds, he has the frame to fill out and become a physical presence as he gets older. The incoming sophomore impressed at IMG Academy's pro day with one of the quickest and smoothest strokes we have evaluated. For such a young talent, Wade is already comfortable in the pocket and has the mobility to evade defenders and extend plays. He's an accurate passer and a legit dual-threat with the tools to be special.</p><hr><h2>17. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256483/jareylan-mccoy\">JaReylan McCoy</a>, DE | Florida commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 9</p><p>Florida keeps stacking five-star defensive line talent, with McCoy the latest to join the mix after flipping from LSU. McCoy has elite length, a big frame and a relentless motor, and all the pieces came together for him on a massive stage during the Under Armour All-America week this winter. McCoy tests off the charts on combine settings (6-7, 260 pounds, 4.88 40-yard dash) and shows the skills and versatility on tape to suggest he could line up in multiple spots along Florida's defensive line. He also doesn't shy away from leading teammates. Don't be surprised if McCoy develops into a game-wrecker in the Swamp.</p><hr><h2>18. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259405/tristen-keys\">Tristen Keys</a>, WR | LSU commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 10</p><p>There might be faster receivers on this list, but few can match Keys' combination of length and ball skills. The 6-3, 190-pound Mississippi native has a knack for hauling in anything thrown his way. He's comfortable lining up in various spots across the formation and using his size and catch radius to his advantage. His body control on contested catches helps compensate for any limitations in short-area quickness. All the tools are there for Keys to develop into a dependable chain mover in Baton Rouge.</p><hr><h2>19. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/257093/richard-wesley\">Richard Wesley</a>, DE | Texas commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 11</p><p>Wesley should fit right in with a stacked defensive line group at Texas. At 6-5 with great length and bulk, he's explosive off the ball with heavy hands and the versatility to line up inside or on the edge. He's also very young for the class after reclassifying from 2027, a factor that will help one day with NFL front offices if he turns his deep toolbox into production alongside <a data-player-guid=\"82773726-0e38-31fc-a028-ab67acc9d259\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5079689/colin-simmons\">Colin Simmons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/253568/justus-terry\">Justus Terry</a>. We're betting Wesley will have a very productive career in Austin.</p><hr><h2>20. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261963/asher-ghioto\">Asher Ghioto</a>, DL | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>Class of 2028</strong></p><p>Ghioto already has the building blocks of a future impact defensive end. At 6-5, 240 pounds, he's a physical, aggressive athlete who has very good initial quickness, bend and body control at a young age. He's beginning to layer in multiple pass-rush moves and should continue to blossom as he develops. Ghioto's leadership skills in camp settings stood out to coaches despite his relative youth and inexperience. He could be a dominant force by the end of his prep career.</p><hr><h2>21. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/256476/kendre-harrison\">Kendre' Harrison</a>, TE | Oregon commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 12</p><p>Tight ends using basketball backgrounds to their advantage isn't anything new. Tony Gonzalez, Antonio Gates and Jimmy Graham are all examples of it working at the highest level. Of the three, Harrison might compare best to Graham, who was also nationally ranked as a prep basketball star. Harrison is an amazing athlete at 6-6, 250 pounds, capable of backboard-shattering dunks and ranking No. 60 on ESPN's Top 100 high school basketball recruits. Unsurprisingly, that athleticism, massive catch radius and leaping ability make Harrison a nightmare to defend on the gridiron. He's a unique multisport standout, and Oregon is giving him the chance to pursue both sports in college.</p><hr><h2>22. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/259542/immanuel-iheanacho\">Immanuel Iheanacho</a>, OT | Oregon commit</h2><p><strong>2026 ESPN 300 rank:</strong> 13</p><p>Good luck finding a more physically imposing lineman in the 2026 class. At 6-7, 350 pounds with a massive 86-inch wingspan, Iheanacho has a combination of size, mobility and power to dream on. He plays with good balance, pad level and violent hands in the run game. He's still refining his change-of-direction skills, but Iheanacho is flashing advanced pass protection traits as well. He impressed at both tackle and guard at the Under Armour All-America game, but long term, his powerful lower body and frame might translate best to left guard. With continued development, he has the physical tools to become a difference-maker on Saturdays -- and potentially Sundays.</p><hr><h2>23. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/260573/joshua-dobson\">Joshua Dobson</a>, CB | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>2027 ESPN Junior 300 rank:</strong> 6</p><p>A high-upside corner with blazing speed and excellent length, Dobson brings the tools college coaches covet and should keep adding strength onto his 6-1 frame. He has great fluidity with short-area quickness, long arms and good instincts in coverage. Coaches rave about his competitiveness, and he impressed at Under Armour's Future 50 event. The best part? He's still in the early stages of refining his technique at corner. Once it all comes together, watch out.</p><hr><h2>24. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/265222/jalen-brewster\">Jalen Brewster</a>, DT | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>2027 ESPN Junior 300 rank:</strong> 7</p><p>Just how athletic is Brewster? Despite his size, the 6-3, 305-pound defender lined up as a wildcat quarterback and running back for his Cedar Hill High School team in Texas. Possessing violent hands and excellent play strength, Brewster is a power-based pass rusher with the ability to close with surprising quickness for his size. Those are the ingredients of an elite, disruptive interior defensive lineman. Coaches praise his motor, and there's no shortage of blue bloods vying to land his commitment.</p><hr><h2>25. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/261598/neimann-lawrence\">Neimann Lawrence</a>, QB | Uncommitted</h2><p><strong>Class of 2028</strong></p><p>Lawrence is just entering his sophomore year, but all the indicators are there that he's a budding star. He was one of the top passers in South Florida as an eighth-grader and followed that up by throwing for nearly 2,800 yards and 31 touchdowns as a freshman. Lawrence didn't look out of place throwing to five-star receivers Chris Henry Jr. and Tristen Keys -- who are both on this list -- in 7-on-7s this year. He oozes arm talent with the adjustability to deliver accurate passes from multiple arm angles, even if forced off platform. He's also evasive enough to make plays with his feet. In a loaded year for Florida quarterbacks, Lawrence belongs near the top.</p>\n</div></div>"

Players and coaches say they aren't asking for perfection, but in interviews with ESPN, several voiced frustration and said they want greater consistency in how games are refereed and the level of physicality allowed.</p><p>From <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-aces\" target=\"_blank\">Las Vegas Aces</a> coach Becky Hammon to first-year <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-valkyries\" target=\"_blank\">Golden State Valkyries</a> coach Natalie Nakase, from young stars such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4433403/caitlin-clark\" target=\"_blank\">Caitlin Clark</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4433402/angel-reese\" target=\"_blank\">Angel Reese</a> to veteran players such as <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/3065570/kelsey-plum\" target=\"_blank\">Kelsey Plum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2529137/natasha-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">Natasha Cloud</a>, the issue has flared several times on the court during games and prompted questions and comments during postgame news conferences.</p><p>It happened again Tuesday night. During the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-fever\" target=\"_blank\">Indiana Fever</a>'s game at the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/conn/connecticut-sun\" target=\"_blank\">Connecticut Sun</a>, Clark took an inbounds pass when referee Michael Price whistled play to stop to review an out-of-bounds call. After a brief discussion with Price, Clark appeared upset and was restrained by Fever assistant coach Briann January. Clark later confronted Price before play resumed.</p><p>The moment was just one of many this season when tensions over officiating have boiled over. As the league grows in popularity and the stakes get higher, so does scrutiny of the people in stripes, and the pressure players feel when those calls don't go their way.</p><p>Monty McCutchen, head of WNBA officiating, said it's his department's job to hold referees accountable based on clear standards, not outside pressure.</p><p>\"We own the stuff that we need to own,\" he said. \"We're really good about that and trying to get better. It's an important piece of our culture to drive toward better performance, but there's always going to be noise about officiating that is inaccurate. We have to stay the course to what good training and good performance look like.\"</p><p>In response to ESPN's questions about officiating, many WNBA players and coaches prefaced their answers by saying they didn't want to get fined.</p><p>Cloud, who was drafted by the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/wsh/washington-mystics\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Mystics</a> in 2015 and is now with the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-liberty\" target=\"_blank\">New York Liberty</a>, pointed to a strained relationship between players and referees.</p><p>\"I work my f---ing ass off all offseason for these four and a half months to try to win a championship,\" Cloud told ESPN. \"And if I feel like [refs are] having too much f---ing impact on the game, it shouldn't be. ... This is collaborative to make this thing go.\"</p><p>Officiating is certainly an annual topic of discussion and debate in nearly every sport in nearly every season, and although officiating has been a major storyline heading into the WNBA All-Star break, statistics don't point to a dramatic shift from previous seasons in how games are called. According to ESPN Research, foul calls are up slightly -- with teams averaging 18.7 fouls per game, the highest since 2017 -- while other metrics remain within historical norms. Flagrant fouls are on pace to total 52 this season, the third most in league history when adjusted for the current 44-game schedule, but still well below last year's record of 77. Technical fouls are projected at 191, which would rank sixth most all time on an adjusted basis.</p><p>Perhaps at play is that there are more eyes on the games than ever. This season, the league is on pace to set a record for the highest average attendance in WNBA history, with about 10,990 fans per game, according to Across the Timeline. That's up from 9,807 last season and 6,615 the year before.</p><p>\"It's an overnight sensation that's been 50-plus years in the making,\" said Lynn Ridinger, a professor of sport management at Old Dominion University who researches referee retention and women's sports. \"Of course there's going to be more scrutiny because we have more people paying attention.\"</p><p><strong>TENSIONS AROUND OFFICIATING</strong> have escalated during the first half of the season, with some athletes using postgame interviews to voice their frustration.</p><p>\"[It] has to be fixed,\" Reese told reporters after the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-sky\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Sky</a>'s 80-75 loss to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-lynx\" target=\"_blank\">Minnesota Lynx</a> on July 6, when the Sky attempted eight free throws to the Lynx's 17. (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/boxscore/_/gameId/401736229\" target=\"_blank\">The Sky were called for 16 personal fouls; the Lynx were whistled for 17</a>.)</p><p>\"I don't give a damn if I get fined because that s--- is cheap,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45689030/sky-angel-reese-says-wnba-officiating-fixed\" target=\"_blank\">Reese said after the game</a>, \"and I'm tired of this s---.\"</p><p>Her comments followed criticism earlier in the season from Las Vegas guard Plum, who said in June, \"I drive more than anyone in the league, so to shoot six free throws is f---ing absurd.\"</p><p>While the conversation around officiating has been loud this season, several players told ESPN that the officiating seems no different than it has been in previous years. What has changed, they said, is the spotlight, with the league's rising popularity and faster, more physical style of play.</p><p>Mystics center <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2529183/stefanie-dolson\" target=\"_blank\">Stefanie Dolson</a>, now in her 11th year with the league, said referees are letting players play through more contact.</p><p>\"I know some girls want more calls, but I think a lot of them will learn, when the refs call too much, it's not fun,\" Dolson said. \"It's not always easy to play through a lot of fouls, but I actually think they're letting us play pretty physically this season, and I'm personally enjoying that.\"</p><p>Other players agreed that physicality is up, but their main ask to officials is to keep it consistent.</p><p>\"People make mistakes, but if we keep making the same mistakes, we're forced to feel as if the mistakes that are happening are choices we make,\" Mystics guard <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2988756/brittney-sykes\" target=\"_blank\">Brittney Sykes</a> told ESPN. \"For me, I just would want to have consistency on both sides of the ball.\"</p><p>Cloud said she holds officials to the same standards she sets for herself. While she understands errors happen on both ends, what frustrates her is when she feels dismissed when trying to communicate officiating errors to referees.</p><p>She was suspended last year after seven technicals, three of which she argued should have been rescinded.</p><p>\"I just think that the overall is, we have these meetings before the season where we talk to the head referees, and I truly don't feel like we're ever heard,\" she said. \"I constantly feel like we're being made to be like babies or complainers.\"</p><p>Still, Cloud acknowledged some improvement this year, crediting referees for making more of an effort before games to communicate.</p><p>Aces forward <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4398776/nalyssa-smith\" target=\"_blank\">NaLyssa Smith</a> told ESPN the growing physicality and mounting frustration often feed each other. Players aren't getting the calls they want, so the physicality is getting worse, she said.</p><p>Speaking out about officiating comes at a cost, as Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White acknowledged Tuesday before <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45750067/caitlin-clark-injures-groin-late-fever-win-sun\" target=\"_blank\">addressing the increased physicality against Clark</a> and in the league overall.</p><p>\"I'm not exactly sure why, but it just is what it is, and we've got to help her learn to adjust and use it against them in certain ways,\" White said. \"We've got to find some ways to make it a little bit easier for her. But the level of physicality overall in our league has been at a different level than it's been for a long time.\"</p><p>WNBA officials are trained to reduce prohibited physicality during games while allowing legitimate, competitive contact.</p><p>\"We're dealing with grown, mature, athletic women who play with their bodies,\" said Sue Blauch, head of referee performance and development for the WNBA. \"They learn to use their bodies to their advantage within this game.\"</p><p>The WNBA does not disclose the amounts it fines players, coaches and team staff who publicly criticize referees. Cloud said the accountability should go both ways.</p><p>\"I also think that there needs to be [a] f---ing fine placed on referees for missed calls, right?\" Cloud said. \"If I can get a technical in the game for my emotions, I think the referees should be able to be reprimanded for their mistakes too. ... If my fines are going to be public knowledge, I think their fines should be f---ing public knowledge.\"</p><p>The league fines or suspends referees for misapplication of rules, but not misjudgment calls.</p><p>\"We have a strong belief that every WNBA official should apply a rule equitably and fairly every single time,\" McCutchen said. \"... We do not fine for judgment calls any more than players get fined for missing free throws, layups or jump shots.\"</p><p>Accountability for referees includes grading of decisions by an independent review team. Those who don't officiate consistently aren't considered for extra income opportunities through playoff or other assignments. The league also has a process in which referees could go on probation or get demoted for misapplication.</p><p><strong>FRUSTRATION WITH OFFICIATING</strong> hasn't been limited to players. Coaches also have spoken out. After a Las Vegas Aces' mid-July loss to the Mystics, Hammon said, \"Tell me how much my fine is,\" as she exited the news conference.</p><p>Hammon had spent the final minutes of the game, and the minutes after, frustrated with what she called \"awful\" officiating. She said she didn't have enough challenges to overturn what she saw on the court.</p><p>\"Jackie [Young] got fouled at 33 seconds [left] on that layup,\" she said. \"No call. Meanwhile, on the other end, I would have challenged seven more calls, and won them. I have no idea what that was. Awful. Our defense was probably similarly awful though.\"</p><p>Before tipoff, when asked about officiating so far this year, Hammon was cheekily warned by a team communications staffer to speak \"without getting fined.\" Still, she offered critique.</p><p>\"The physicality is out of control. I think the freedom of movement is a joke,\" she said. \"There is no freedom of movement. ... It's not basketball; it's rugby.\"</p><p>Hammon and Mystics coach Sydney Johnson said that no matter how officials call the game, their coaching approach remains the same.</p><p>\"I really want our players to focus on the challenge of five other players on the court and try to just rise above whatever calls come their way,\" Johnson said. \"I'm really intent on us trying to just attack the other team and hold together, no matter what the adversity is.\"</p><p>Valkyries coach Nakase -- a former assistant coach for the Aces and the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles Clippers</a> -- is halfway through her first season as a WNBA head coach and already calling for more consistency in how the games are being officiated.</p><p>After the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-mercury\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenix Mercury</a> beat the Valkyries on Monday night, Nakase said it was a disservice that the Mercury won the game off a free throw in the last second. The foul was called on Golden State's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/4257500/cecilia-zandalasini\" target=\"_blank\">Cecilia Zandalasini</a> with two seconds left, after she made contact with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/player/_/id/2529140/alyssa-thomas\" target=\"_blank\">Alyssa Thomas</a> near the basket.</p><p>\"I saw absolutely no foul,\" Nakase said. \"The physicality of the game for Phoenix was 10 times more versus our physicality. I saw absolutely no foul. ... I believe you have to win off of great shots.\"</p><p>On consistency, the league said it's important that referees call similar plays similarly. But McCutchen said \"consistency is often misused in a desire for everything to be equitable.\"</p><p>\"If teams are playing differently,\" he said, \"consistency does not mean equity.\"</p><p><strong>NO MATTER WHAT'S</strong> fueling the scrutiny around officiating, fans say they're paying attention, too. Karlton Genwright, a fan of Reese and the Mystics who resides in Maryland, said the calls have been \"consistently bad.\"</p><p>\"[There needs to be] accountability, whether it's the refs should have to answer to the media,\" he said, suggesting the league adopt something similar to the <a href=\"https://official.nba.com/2024-25-nba-officiating-last-two-minute-reports/\" target=\"_blank\">NBA's Last Two Minute Report</a> to review calls.</p><p>\"Right now, it's radio silence,\" he said. \"Players are saying something.\"</p><p>McCutchen said the WNBA doesn't have a Last Two Minute Report because of a lack of resources.</p><p>\"There's no philosophical reason not to do it,\" he said. \"We want to be accountable and transparent in our work. Right now, the resources are not there.\"</p><p>Genwright said the officiating doesn't ruin the games for him, but he wants to see them called fairly for the integrity of the competition.</p><p>Candra and Haj Jalloh, a couple from the D.C. area and longtime Mystics season-ticket holders, echoed similar frustrations. Sitting close enough to hear players and coaches, they said they've noticed moments when it seems as if refs give preferential treatment, like when the Mystics faced the Liberty.</p><p>\"The New York bench thought that there was a foul, and the assistant coach was like, 'That's Sabrina,' ... basically like, you gotta call that. You gotta protect her,\" Candra said. \"It really wasn't a foul.\"</p><p>Candra said officiating can affect the rhythm of a game and it sometimes feels like referees are making it about themselves instead of the players.</p><p>But ultimately, they said, it doesn't stop them from enjoying the experience.</p><p><i>ESPN senior writer Katie Barnes contributed to this report.</i></p>\n</div></div>"

Which players who labored through tough, relatively unproductive seasons in 2024 are aligned to rebound in 2025?&nbsp;</p><p>Before I begin, I did not simply include players who were injured for all or most of 2024. I didn't cop out like that. These are players who struggled for other reasons. Alright, let's get to the list.&nbsp;</p><p>For prediction transparency, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-comeback-candidates-saquon-barkley-among-veterans-who-could-experience-resurgence-in-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">last year in this article</a></span>, my selections were <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131252/curtis-samuel/\">Curtis Samuel</a> (injury miss), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2247190/jeremy-chinn/\">Jeremy Chinn</a> (kinda-sorta hit), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183962/carlton-davis/\">Carlton Davis</a> (injury miss) and ... <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> (hit).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3164710/keaton-mitchell/\">Keaton Mitchell</a> doesn't feel like a veteran -- we've only seen him for 47 carries in his rookie season in 2023 and 15 carries a year ago after his return from an ACL tear. Truth is, this is now a third-year pro within Baltimore's dynamic run offense.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Of course, said ground-game brilliance is anchored by <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061188/derrick-henry/\">Derrick Henry</a>, but Mitchell has the juice to rebound as the ideal lightning complement to Henry's thunder. Remember, this is a back who ran 4.37 with a 38-inch vertical entering the league out of East Carolina just two years ago. He only turned 23 years old in January. The ACL shouldn't limit his explosiveness whatsoever by September, which will be the 20-month mark since the injury.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, veteran <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2250388/justice-hill/\">Justice Hill</a> stands in Mitchell's way as the primary backup to Henry. I expect Mitchell to emerge as the more consistent big-play option when Henry takes his rare breathers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121372/kenneth-walker-iii/\">Kenneth Walker III</a> got a raw deal last season in Seattle. His yards-per-carry average dipped for the third-straight season from 4.6 to 4.1 to 3.7, and he averaged fewer than 14 carries per game for the first time in his professional career.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>The dip in production was completely centered around the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a> unstable, porous offensive line. Because Walker forced the most missed tackles of his <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> career (61) on the fewest amount of touches he's ever gotten in a season (153), and his 3.05 yards-after-contact-per-carry figure of 3.05 rivaled his rookie-year figure of 3.08.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2025, the Seahawks will at least start the season more healthy up front, with at times punishing left tackle <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865489/abraham-lucas/\">Abraham Lucas</a> ready for the season after not playing until Week 11 last year. Plus, the Seahawks selected uber-athletic blocker Grey Zabel in the first round of the draft.&nbsp;</p><p>Walker is genuinely one of the most naturally talented running backs in the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. I expect him to start producing closer to his rookie year in his fourth season in the Pacific Northwest in 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/50-days-until-nfl-opener-50-under-the-radar-players-who-could-shape-2024-plus-afc-quarterbacks-under-pressure/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>50 days until NFL opener, 50 under-the-radar players who could shape 2024 plus AFC quarterbacks under pressure</p>\n                <p>\n                    Tyler Sullivan                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"50 days until NFL opener, 50 under-the-radar players who could shape 2024 plus AFC quarterbacks under pressure\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/17/3bac6c20-2590-40bf-b143-d26bed0d008f/thumbnail/270x152/c5b1335512e8efc25148af8ff2d2dd66/curtis-samuel-g.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n\n<p>No one expected <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079887/evan-engram/\">Evan Engram</a> to catch 114 passes in 2024 after reaching that mark the previous season, but his 47 grabs for 365 yards with one touchdown was altogether deemed a disappointment in what amounted to his final year in Jacksonville.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of his seismic dip in productivity can be pegged on running routes within an offense operated by a mostly ineffective <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741202/mac-jones/\">Mac Jones</a> -- together the two quarterbacks averaged fewer than 7.0 yards per attempt, and that is the low-end benchmark for respectable efficiency at the quarterback spot in today's <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>.</p><p>At the most granular level, Engram wasn't much less efficient himself, as his yards-per-route run (1.51) in 2024 compared to his 1.56 in the monstrous 2023. The volume just wasn't remotely close. He also only dropped one pass on his 62 targets.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> signed the soon-to-be 31-year-old tight end presumably to serve as <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121193/bo-nixs/\">Bo Nix's</a> security blanket underneath in his second season. I expect Engram's catch figure to be much closer to his 2023 total than last year's.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

Trading for a third baseman when you don't need a third baseman qualifies as bold, I suppose. The D-backs are kinda sorta maybe hanging around the wild-card race. That said, the trade market is light on quality infielders. Cashing Suárez in as a trade chip in a seller's market makes sense. I'll say Suárez goes to the Brewers and the main piece in the return is righty <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910628/tobias-myers/\">Tobias Myers</a>, who has been squeezed out of Milwaukee's deep rotation. An overpay? Yeah, probably, but whoever gets Suárez will have to win a bidding war.         </p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/311.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>         <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/\">(Sacramento) Athletics</a>         </h2><p><strong>Prediction: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426033/nick-kurtz/\">Nick Kurtz</a> will lead all first basemen in home runs.</strong></p><p>The A's selected Kurtz with the No. 4 pick in last summer's draft and he's been an instant difference-maker. He was called up on April 23 and took a .257/.333/.558 line and 17 home runs into the All-Star break. Those 17 home runs are 12th most in baseball since the day Kurtz was called up, and they're fourth most among all first baseman for the full season. Only <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2447476/pete-alonso/\">Pete Alonso</a> (21), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3166850/spencer-torkelson/\">Spencer Torkelson</a> (21), and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117931/michael-busch/\">Michael Busch</a> (19) have more. Kurtz spotted those guys four weeks and is still right on their tails. So, for this bold prediction, I'll say Kurtz passes those three and finishes 2025 with more home runs than any other first baseman. Sutter Health Park in Sacramento has played a huge role in Kurtz's power output (13 homers at home and four on the road), but the A's aren't moving. He'll continue to play home games there the rest of the year.      </p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/315.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>         \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\">Atlanta Braves</a>         </h2><p><strong>Prediction: The Braves will set an MLB record for pitchers used.</strong></p><p>It has been a tough season for the Braves generally, and also their pitchers specifically. <span>Reynaldo López</span>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911687/spencer-schwellenbach/\">Spencer Schwellenbach</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911746/aj-smith-shawver/\">AJ Smith-Shawver</a> have all suffered major injuries, setup man <span>Joe Jiménez</span> hasn't pitched because of knee surgery, and they've cycled through a small army of spot starters and relievers. Atlanta has used 31 different pitchers this year, fourth most in baseball behind the Mets (37), Dodgers (35), and Diamondbacks (32). This bold prediction calls for the Braves to zoom by those three teams and use a record number of pitchers this season. The record: 45 by last year's Marlins. Can Atlanta use 15 new pitchers in the second half? Absolutely. I believe in them. The trade deadline is coming, they'll continue shuttling relievers in and out, etc. When in doubt, take the over on pitchers used.        </p>\n        \n\n<div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/302.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/326.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>         \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Baltimore Orioles</a><br>         <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a>         </h2><p><strong>Prediction: San Diego will trade for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044513/zach-eflin/\">Zach Eflin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2227731/cedric-mullins/\">Cedric Mullins</a>.</strong>         </p><p>Who will the Padres trade to get Eflin and Mullins to address their rotation and outfield needs?

The Red Sox would upgrade the bullpen, which takes on increased important in October, which is where they're headed.        </p>\n        \n\n<div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/316.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/KC/kansas-city-royals/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/307.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>         \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a><br>         <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/KC/kansas-city-royals/\">Kansas City Royals</a>         </h2><p><strong>Prediction: Chicago will trade for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2210221/seth-lugo/\">Seth Lugo</a>.</strong>         </p><p>The Royals went into the All-Star break with the second-best ERA+ (118) and the fifth-worst OPS+ (88).

The underlying numbers aren't as spectacular, though Lugo has been just about as good this year as last year, when he finished second in the AL Cy Young voting. The trade market figures to be short on quality starters. Cashing in Lugo, who has a $15 million player option for 2026, as a trade chip may be the best way for Kansas City to get the offensive help they so desperately need.

The Reds tried to get Robert in the offseason and I assume they'll try again at the deadline given a) their need for an outfielder, and b) the price coming down given Robert's poor season. He took a .190/.275/.325 slash line into the break, which is just terrible. That said, outfielders with less upside will be traded in the coming weeks. There is no chance the White Sox will pick up Robert's $20 million option after the season, so they figure to trade him for whatever they can get at the deadline. The Reds need an outfielder and they're right in the mix of the wild-card race. Robert would be a nice low-cost move with a chance to pay huge dividends. Bonus bold prediction: Robert will have a higher WAR with his new team after the trade deadline than he's had the last two years combined with Chicago (1.4).         </p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/318.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>         \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/\">Colorado Rockies</a>         </h2><p><strong>Prediction: The Rockies will not set a record for home losses.</strong>         </p><p>Hey, the Rockies have been regular bad the last few weeks rather than historically terrible. After going 9-50(!) in their first 59 games, the Rockies are 13-24 since, which isn't even the worst record in baseball. The Nationals are 10-27 during that time. The 13-24 record works out to a 105-loss pace. That's bad, obviously, but we see 105-loss teams all the time. The Rockies are, however, 10-36 at Coors Field. Every other team has at least 18 wins at home. This bold prediction says the Rockies will not -- <em>not</em> -- set a new record for home losses. Here are the most home losses in a season:         </p>\n        \n\n<ol><li><strong>2019 Detroit Tigers:</strong> 59</li><li><strong>1939 St. Louis Browns:</strong> 59</li><li><strong>2024 Chicago White Sox:</strong> 58</li><li><strong>2003 Detroit Tigers:</strong> 58</li><li><strong>1962 New York Mets:</strong> 58</li></ol><p>The Rockies must go 12-23 in their final 35 home games to merely tie the record for home losses and avoid setting a new record. Considering they have 12 wins in their last 54 home dating back to last season, this figures to be a tall order, and that's what makes this prediction bold. Colorado won't be the first team in history to lose 60 games in front of their home fans.

That's the pitching Triple Crown, which isn't as rare or significant an accomplishment as the hitting Triple Crown, but is still impressive nonetheless. Skubal has been even better this year (he has a lower ERA and a higher strikeout rate), and I am boldly predicting he will win the pitching Triple Crown yet again. Back-to-back pitching Triple Crowns have happened, but it is very rare:        </p><ul><li><strong>Roger Clemens:</strong> 1997 and 1998</li><li><strong>Sandy Koufax:</strong> 1965 and 1966</li><li><strong>Lefty Grove:</strong> 1930 and 1931</li><li><strong>Grover Alexander:</strong> 1915 and 1916</li></ul><p>The greatest pitchers ever, basically.

Tucker has been fantastic for the first-place Cubs, and the Astros are getting great production from Smith and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910610/isaac-paredes/\">Isaac Paredes</a>. Smith, the No. 14 overall pick in last summer's draft, is hitting .277/.347/.418 with seven home runs this season, and he's been outstanding since June 1: .296/.346/.451 in 37 games. He's done that while learning a new position on the fly (right field). For this bold prediction, I have the Astros locking Smith up to a long-term extension. In-season extensions are uncommon, especially in the second half, but Smith is a special player and I don't think Houston will wait to act. How does eight years and $80 million sound?

Helsley will be a free agent after the season though, and losing him for nothing but a draft pick (if St. Louis even makes him the qualifying offer) would be tough to swallow. The Cardinals strike me as a prime candidate to buy <em>and</em> sell at the deadline. Trade Helsley while bringing in relief help elsewhere, that sort of thing. The Dodgers need late-inning help even with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1953420/blake-treinen/\">Blake Treinen</a> on the mend. That much is clear.

Going big doesn't always yield the desired results (see: Adames' slash line), but neither does going smart and sensible, as the Farhan Zaidi era showed. For this next bold prediction, I will say Posey continues to big-game hunt and lands Alcantara at the trade deadline. The Marlins are going to move him, that is a near certainty and not at all bold. It's Posey and the Giants swinging big and beating out teams with deeper farm systems to get it done.

The Braves and Mets finished tied for the division title in 2022, and last season the Braves, Mets, and Diamondbacks finished in a three-way tie for two wild-card spots. Surely you remember the doubleheader in Atlanta the day after the end of the regular season. The Braves and Mets split the two games while the D-backs watched at home, hoping one team would sweep and send them to the postseason. I'll call it three tiebreakers involving the NL East in the last four years in this bold prediction. The Mets and Phillies have been trading places atop the division for weeks now. Neither team seems to want to run away with it. It's only natural that they'll finish with the same record, in which case the NL East title will go to whichever team wins the season series. Alas and alack, MLB did away with Game 163 tiebreakers in the current collective bargaining agreement. Now all ties are decided mathematically.

They're on pace to finish with a worse record this year than the last two years despite having arguably the best pitcher in the world on a league minimum salary. Skenes has been terrific this season, pitching to an MLB-leading 2.01 ERA with 131 strikeouts in 121 innings, but he's 4-8 because the Pirates just do not score runs behind him. So, this bold prediction says Skenes will finish the season with more WAR than wins, which is true right now (4.8 WAR vs. 4 wins) and has been done only once by a qualified pitcher in baseball's Modern Era (since 1901): Eddie Smith went 4-17 with 4.2 WAR for the 1937 Athletics. He threw 196 ⅔ innings with a 3.94 ERA for a team that went 54-97-3. Skenes finishing with, say, 7.5 WAR while going 7-14 because the Pirates have one of the worst offenses in baseball seems doable, and it will say so much more about the Pirates than it will Skenes.         </p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/312.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>         \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Seattle Mariners</a>         </h2><p><strong>Prediction: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933037/cal-raleigh/\">Cal Raleigh</a> will hit between 59-61 homers.</strong>         </p><p>Raleigh took an incredible 38 home runs into the All-Star break, second most all-time behind Barry Bonds' 39 first-half homers in 2001. Those 38 homers are already the ninth most by a catcher in a full season, and Raleigh got there by the All-Star break. He is currently on pace to hit 64 homers, which would break Aaron Judge's American League single-season record (62 in 2022). This bold prediction says Raleigh will fall short of the record, and will instead finish with 59, 60, or 61 homers. That would shatter the single-season record for a catcher (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1793168/salvador-perez/\">Salvador Perez</a>'s 48 in 48 in 2021) and, more importantly, means we'll get an honest-to-goodness record chase. Raleigh will make a legit run at Judge's record. I think he'll fall short because he's a catcher and the wear and tear is brutal, T-Mobile Park is a tough park for home runs, and teams will probably start intentionally walking him more in the coming weeks. Still, a 59-plus homer season by a catcher is preposterous. This is an all-time great home run season period. Add in the catcher component and it is simply remarkable.         </p>\n        \n\n<div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/329.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>         \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/\">Tampa Bay Rays</a>         </h2><p><strong>Prediction: <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28839811/junior-caminero/\">Junior Caminero</a> will go 32-32.</strong>         </p><p>Caminero has only five stolen bases this season, though I'm not predicting he will hit 32 homers and steal 32 bases.

Only four players have ever gone 30-30:         </p><ul><li><strong>Ivan Rodriguez, 1999 Rangers:</strong> 35 HR and 31 GIDP</li><li><strong>Tony Armas Sr., 1983 Red Sox:</strong> 36 HR and 31 GIDP</li><li><strong>Jim Rice, 1983 Red Sox:</strong> 39 HR and 31 GIDP</li><li><strong>Dave Winfield, 1983 Yankees:</strong> 32 HR and 30 GIDP</li></ul><p>Must've been something in the AL East water in 1983. Anyway, Caminero is on pace to hit 38 homers and ground into 42 double plays, so this bold prediction is within reach. I just assume the double play pace will slow down at some point (it has to, right?). And, to be clear, Caminero going 32-32 would not diminish what is an incredible season for the 22 year old. Lots of guys have very productive seasons while striking out a ton. Caminero is doing it while hitting into double plays. That's the way it goes sometimes.         </p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/313.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>         \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Texas Rangers</a>         </h2><p><strong>Prediction: The Rangers will miss the postseason despite having a better run differential than at least three teams that make it. </strong>        </p>\n        \n\n<p>The Rangers are all about run prevention. They've allowed only 3.57 runs per game this season, the fewest in baseball, and they've scored only 4.05 runs per game. That is seventh fewest in baseball. The pitching prevents runs and so too does the offense. Thanks mostly to their pitching, the Rangers are only 3 ½ games behind the third wild-card spot, so a postseason berth is within reach. Alas, this bold prediction says Texas will fall short, but they will do so with a strong run differential. Their plus-47 run differential is tenth best in baseball. Every year, a team or two sneaks into the postseason with a negative run differential. It'll happen again this year. The Rangers will keep up their superb run prevention but lose too many one and two-run games because of the offense, so the end result will be not enough wins to reach the postseason and a better run differential than at least three teams that make it. A frustrating outcome, that would be. Sorry, Rangers fans.        </p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/314.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>        \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a>        </h2><p><strong>Prediction: Toronto will hold the best record in the AL for at least one day.</strong>        </p><p>In the span of 40 days the Blue Jays went from eight games back in the AL East to 3 ½ games up, and they took a two-game division lead into the All-Star break. If not for the Red Sox's 10-game winning streak to close out the first half, Toronto would be the hottest team in baseball. They're so hot, in fact, that I boldly predict they will spend at least one day atop the American League standings. Right now, the Blue Jays are 3 ½ games behind the Tigers for the top spot, which is a smaller margin than I realized. The Blue Jays are very good and also the Tigers have the AL Central title in the bag, so I suspect they will take their foot off the gas in September. Rest some players, hold postseason roster auditions, etc. Toronto is playing well and the Tigers not having the pressure to chase every last win will open the door for the Blue Jays to sit in the AL's top seed at some point.        </p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/WAS/washington-nationals/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/322.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <h2>         \t<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/WAS/washington-nationals/\">Washington Nationals</a>         </h2><p><strong>Prediction: The Nationals will finish 71-91. </strong>        </p><p>Third time's a charm? The Nationals went 71-91 in 2023 and 71-91 in 2024. I'm going to say they'll finish 71-91 again in 2025, and hey, that's good news! Washington entered the break with a 38-58 record, putting them on pace to go 64-98. To finish 71-91 for the third straight season, the Nationals have to go 34-33 the rest of the way. How often do we see a young team play .500-ish ball over the final two months and use that as a springboard into contention the next year? That is my bold prediction. The Nationals play their two best months of baseball in quite a while to close out 2025.        </p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

The action begins in earnest Thursday as a massive field visits Northern Ireland competing for the Claret Jug for just the third time in the history of the world's oldest golf championship. Royal Portrush will be a struggle for most in the field, and even Rory McIlroy -- making his homecoming -- has had poor rounds on this course.</p><p>McIlroy, at age 16, set a course record with a 61 in Portrush. The last time The Open was hosted at this site in 2019, he ejected on the first hole and finished posted an opening-round 78. So yes, if a career grand slam winner and native son can be tested by Royal Portrush, no one in the field this week is safe.</p><p>The action begins Thursday with Round 1 setting the stage for year's final major. While the skies look to be relatively clear, wind can come at any time and throw even the best in the world off their game. Royal Portrush is hosting The Open for just the third time, and it remains the only course outside of Scotland and England to crown a Champion Golfer of the Year.&nbsp;</p><p>The grounds are filled to capacity with fans, and they are undoubtedly keen to see how the likes of McIlroy, Shane Lowry, Robert MacIntyre, Tommy Fleetwood and other top-tier European golfers alongside the likes of world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and reigning champion Xander Schauffele.</p><p>Both Scheffler and McIlroy are seeking their second major of the season, but Scottie enters as a clear 9/2 favorite, per Caesars Sportsbook, with McIlroy second on the board at 7-1. Jon Rahm stands third given his improved play of late not only on LIV Golf but during the three majors at which he's competed.</p>\n        \n\n<p>There is so much to follow this week that it can be overwhelming at times.

\"greater confidence\" of beating Australia in the first Test after seeing the Wallabies' under-strength line-up, says Ugo Monye.</b></p><p>The tourists were favourites to win this summer's three-match series, as they did on their last visit Down Under in 2013, but former Lions wing Monye says Andy Farrell's side will be boosted by some notable absentees in the Australia XV.</p><p>Australia head coach Joe Schmidt has named a team without experienced lock Will Skelton and powerful back row Rob Valetini, who both have calf injuries, for the opening Test in Brisbane.</p><p>\"Without Skelton and Valetini, Australia are underpowered and it takes away some of their super strengths,\" Monye, who toured South Africa with the Lions in 2009, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sounds/play/p0lqnlxj\">told BBC Rugby Union Weekly</a>. </p><p>\"The Lions were favourites before we even saw their squad. </p><p>\"Now we have seen their team and the Australian team, there is a greater sense of confidence.\"</p><p>The hosts have also handed rookie fly-half <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cjelg5ykvd3o\">Tom Lynagh, the son of Wallaby great Michael, a first Test start</a> in the absence of regular number 10 Noah Lolesio.</p><p>The Lions, meanwhile, have named a formidable line-up of Test stars, which includes a powerful back row and an all-Scotland midfield.</p><p>Tom Curry has been selected at open-side flanker in the most hotly contested position, after fending off fierce competition from Jac Morgan and former world player of the player Josh van der Flier. </p><p>Monye added: \"It has gone to Tom Curry and I'm thrilled for him and everyone that has been selected.</p><p>\"Jac Morgan is probably the one out of everyone not selected to have every reason to be slightly miffed.</p><p>\"Morgan has been superb and then you also have a former world player of the year with loads of experience. </p><p>\"Anyone who plays at seven is going to do a brilliant job, as you would expect on a Lions tour because you are dealing with the best of the best. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2

power at the breakdown and his versatility may have edged the contest in his favour for the number seven jersey.</p><p>The Englishman will play alongside Ireland number eight Jack Conan and Tadhg Beirne, who is usually a lock but has been chosen over Ollie Chessum at blind-side flanker.</p><p>\"Tom Curry is so destructive and it all starts with mindset.

He's like, 'OK, we'll start talking with some guys, UFL, XFL,'\" Manziel said. \"And I'm just sitting there thinking like, 'There's no way I'm going back to f***ing play in one of these early leagues ... UFL ... XFL ... Anything like that.'\"</p><p>Manziel told Paul he \"hated Cleveland,\" and leaving College Station and his native Texas was a culture shock of sorts at the next level. At the time, Manziel <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/johnny-manziel-recounts-troubles-with-browns-says-he-watched-zero-film-during-time-in-cleveland/\" target=\"_blank\">was more interested in partying</a></span>&nbsp;than improving as a football player and understanding the responsibilities of being a professional athlete.</p>\n        \n\n<p>Manziel has previously acknowledged he wasn't interested in watching film or game plan prep and felt \"empty\" with the Browns.</p><p>Manziel went 2-6 as the starter in his NFL career and completed 57% of his passes for 1,675 yards, seven touchdowns and seven interceptions to go along with 259 rushing yards and another score. That wasn't what anyone expected from <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>'s best player over his previous couple years at Texas A&amp;M as a difference-maker in the SEC.</p><p>\"I would sit in my condo in Cleveland downtown and just feel like it was the only place that I could get away from everybody and anything,\" <a href=\"https://247sports.com/longformarticle/johnny-manziel-untold-review-what-to-expect-in-netflixs-tell-all-documentary-213239042/\" target=\"_blank\">Manziel said during Netflix's \"Untold\" series</a> detailing his tumultuous career in 2023. \"And I would look out those windows every day and I just felt empty. I went from one fishbowl city to another, and I wanted nothing to do with football. I wanted nothing to do with stepping on that field. And I had bigger issues in my life than being able to go out and play free-spirited, flowing football.\"&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Manziel told Paul this week he hasn't given up on a comeback, but understands that's likely out of the cards.</p><p>\"As much as I would like to think that that's something I can do, I think at 32, my chances are probably pretty chopped,\" Manziel said.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

The two fighters first met at featherweight in Holloway's UFC debut in 2012.

There's just a thing in sports sometimes where one guy has another's number, and I think that's the case here. Dustin is just a more impactful striker. Max is great, but I don't think he has enough power to consistently stand with these lightweights. <i>-- Anthony Smith</i></p><p><img br=\"\" height=\"75px\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0604/espn_din-thomas_.jpg\">It's a home game for Dustin, and I think he has the ability to counterpunch Max. That's what gave Holloway problems in his last fight with Poirier, and I'm not sure Holloway has picked up on that and made the necessary adjustments. It's going to be a close fight, though. Competitive fight. I just think Dustin wins more rounds. <i>-- Din Thomas</i></p><h3>Betting analysis</h3><p><i>Odds accurate as of Thursday.

With two fighters of this caliber who have some of the best durability in the sport, it would be shocking if this fight wasn't competitive from bell to bell. The biggest question could be how Holloway responds to the first knockout loss of his career, the last time out against <a data-player-guid=\"7c7452e8-f7d0-bfa0-f6dd-61d531ad856e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4350812/ilia-topuria\">Ilia Topuria</a>. Poirier doesn't carry the same power. He is more the type to wear you down and finish you late in the fight, so the over 4.5 rounds feels like the play here. If you want better odds, take the fight to go the distance.</p><hr><h2>Parker's best bets on the rest of the UFC card</h2><h3>Middleweight: <a data-player-guid=\"d1996f3e-6feb-6558-f478-a08a6d15917c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4080826/paulo-costa\">Paulo Costa</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"0180f755-bea6-22fd-2788-2ce490a578da\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4300149/roman-kopylov\">Roman Kopylov</a></h3><p><b>Kopylov to win (-240).</b> Costa had a lot of success earlier in his career knocking out opponents and imposing his will with his athleticism, but it's been a while since he has had a dominant win over anyone of significance. Enter Kopylov. He is the betting favorite, and I am shocked the number isn't higher. Kopylov is the better striker and has worked hard of late to improve his takedown defense. Unless Costa turns into Anthony \"Fluffy\" Hernandez and becomes an incredible wrestler with unlimited cardio, look for Kopylov to put on a striking clinic and get the win here. If you don't like the -240 odds, take Kopylov to win by decision.</p><h3>Featherweight: <a data-player-guid=\"bf4de332-335e-ecee-ffe5-434ed46c08c8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4074001/dan-ige\">Dan Ige</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"460c1cfb-7979-8514-c911-1e27684cb836\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2532870/patricio-pitbull\">Patricio Pitbull</a></h3><p><b>Ige to win (-220).</b> Coming off a knockout win, Ige will be looking to add Pitbull to his résumé and continue to climb the ranks of the featherweight division. Ige has an endless gas tank, fight-ending power and a high fight IQ, which should pay off well for him against a seasoned MMA veteran. Pitbull didn't look like himself in his UFC debut, a decision loss to <a data-player-guid=\"0d4827a7-7803-bbe1-c14b-3761c5b97a1f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3155420/yair-rodriguez\">Yair Rodriguez</a> in April, but he was one of Bellator MMA's best fighters for a long time. Expect a competitive fight here. Both guys tend to start slowly, but Ige's volume and pace will increase as the fight goes on and get him the win. Ige opened as a -175 favorite and has climbed to -220. If those odds continue to rise, take Ige to win and the over 1.5 rounds.</p><h3>Middleweight: <a data-player-guid=\"43948b20-f9b7-6baf-532e-044bc82a5d80\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4001851/marvin-vettori\">Marvin Vettori</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"9f596ce0-1f13-bd7e-d4a6-2581007fb8fc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4025699/brendan-allen\">Brendan Allen</a></h3><p><b>Allen to win (-210).</b> Allen and Vettori have had run-ins outside the cage in the past, and now they will get to settle their differences in the Octagon. Allen is a -210 favorite, and I agree with the oddsmakers. As good as Vettori, a nine-year UFC veteran, once was, he has become a low-volume striker with no takedown attempts. But he still holds onto his durability. Allen has all the skills to be a champion but tends to fall short right before a title is in sight. He is getting Vettori at the right time in his career, and I expect Allen to be the better fighter everywhere and anywhere the fight goes. When Allen is aggressive, he is at his best. Expect him to show out in his home state of Louisiana.</p><h2>Parker's best bets for PFL Cape Town</h2><h3>Middleweight: Johnny Eblen vs. Costello van Steenis</h3><p><b>Eblen to win; over 2.5. rounds.</b> In the main event, Eblen will look to defend his middleweight championship against lethal striker van Steenis. Look for Eblen, a heavy favorite, to get this fight to the ground early and keep a menacing pace to tire out van Steenis and lessen his striking power as the fight goes on. Either put Eblen as the anchor to your parlay or take him to win and the over 2.5 rounds. He should win rounds and take this fight into deep waters.</p><h3>Women's flyweight: Dakota Ditcheva vs. Sumiko Inaba</h3><p><b>Ditcheva to win by TKO/KO.</b> Inaba will be looking to derail the hype train of Ditcheva, but I just don't see that happening. Ditcheva has world-class striking and fight-ending power that continues to get better each time she hits the PFL SmartCage. The only way to bet this fight is to take Ditcheva by TKO/KO. For the best odds possible, take her to finish it in Round 1.</p><h3>Heavyweight: <a data-player-guid=\"01b14461-921d-ae47-db54-f9abc3c10bf7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3112020/corey-anderson\">Corey Anderson</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"61b7a1da-402e-30aa-4efb-43e39cb0ccc7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3024604/denis-goltsov\">Denis Goltsov</a></h3><p><b>Anderson to win.</b> In a fight that can dictate who competes for the PFL heavyweight title later in the year, former Bellator light heavyweight champion Anderson takes on last season's PFL heavyweight champion Golstov. The outcome of this fight is going to depend on whether Anderson can outwrestle his opponent early and survive Round 1. On the feet, I would lean toward Golstov, but the wrestling and cardio departments belong to Anderson. I am going to take a flier on the underdog, Anderson, because Golstov has a questionable gas tank and was too easily taken down by <a data-player-guid=\"0727ff36-b376-10da-3cfe-c1e084506cc8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4336342/oleg-popov\">Oleg Popov</a> in his last fight.</p>\n</div></div>"

Not only did the Commanders nearly double their win total set prior to the season, but they won two road playoff games to earn a trip to the NFC Championship, where they gave up seven rushing touchdowns in a loss to the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a>.</p><p>To help bolster their defensive front after finishing 28th in yards per rush allowed, the Commanders signed four new defensive linemen in free agency, most notably <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2869019/javon-kinlaw/\">Javon Kinlaw</a> to a three-year, $45 million deal, then brought in Von Miller ahead of training camp.&nbsp;But the rest of the team's key acquisitions this offseason came on the other side of the ball. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139735/deebo-samuel/\">Deebo Samuel</a> comes over from San Francisco to give Daniels a legit second weapon in the passing game alongside <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139279/terry-mclaurin/\">Terry McLaurin</a>. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079900/laremy-tunsil/\">Laremy Tunsil</a> gives Daniels a high-level blindside protector at left tackle, and first-round pick Josh Conerly becomes the heir apparent at right tackle.</p><p>If Daniels can avoid a sophomore slump, it's hard to see the Commanders offense not being among the best in the league once again in 2025. The team's ceiling may be tied to the defense and whether it can elevate from league average into the top 10. Dan Quinn's <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> defenses finished top seven in scoring in all three of his seasons with the team, but his stint in Atlanta only saw his defense finish higher than 14th once. Pushing beyond that level could be what this team needs to reach the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a>.</p><p>We're going to take a quick look at the Commanders' 2024 season and the rest of their offseason moves before getting into their track record in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> futures over the last five years.

The latter has graded out positively among tackles in six of the last seven years, per PFF, while the latter is capable of adding to both the passing and rushing attacks after receiving 180 rushing attempts in his last four seasons in San Francisco.</p><p>Washington also has an easier schedule relative to the rest of the division, starting with facing the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> in the first four weeks of the season. Throw in winnable road games against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> and Cowboys, and the Commanders could march into Kansas City in Week 8 with 5-7 wins already in the bank before the schedule gets tougher down the stretch. That includes facing the Eagles twice in the last three weeks, though Week 18 could look much different depending on the postseason motivations of both teams.&nbsp;</p><h2>Reasons to fade the Commanders</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-stroud/\">C.J. Stroud</a> showed last year that sophomore slumps are real for quarterbacks who impressed as rookies, and while Tunsil is the common denominator between the two situations, the rest of the Washington offensive line, just like Houston, brings questions. Each starting spot may feature an average or worse player for his position, especially with Sam Cosmi suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs last season and likely to miss a good chunk of the season. Conerly will likely take development to be a quality starter as a late first-round pick as well. Daniels had the sixth-most sacks of any quarterback last year, and a similar season could make staying healthy worth worrying about.</p><p>Javon Kinlaw, the major addition on defense, is more of a boost to the pass rush than the run defense, and it's hard to see where Washington's run defense got better after finishing 28th in yards per attempt allowed. That ranking showed that <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1631476/bobby-wagner/\">Bobby Wagner</a> can't do it all himself, nor should he be expected to at age 35. After giving up 430 rushing yards in their last two playoff games, Washington has given opposing offenses a blueprint in how to not only put together scoring drives but also keep Daniels off the field as much as possible.</p><h2>How to bet the Commanders in 2025</h2><ul><li><strong>Miss playoffs +130 (DraftKings)</strong></li><li><strong>Terry McLaurin Over 980.5 receiving yards -110 (BetMGM)</strong></li></ul><p>I see the Commanders as a tough team to play or fade in the futures markets this season. Jayden Daniels has the potential to carry the team to 10 wins if the talent we saw last year was real, but he's going to see a leap in the quality of defenses he faces this year after Washington got to play a last-place schedule in 2024. Since I have them right around 9-10 wins, my best team future is going to be to miss the playoffs at the juicy +130 price at DraftKings, with the thinking that the NFC North and NFC West are so deep that some trio from a pool of the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, Packers, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Bears</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a> could take up all the wild card spots and leave Washington needing a division title to make the postseason. If you'd prefer to make a positive play on the Commanders, I'd recommend just going for the big payout of a division winner play and hoping the Eagles' schedule is the deciding factor.</p><p>Terry McLaurin has topped 1,000 receiving yards in five straight seasons, and the only reason he didn't do so as a rookie was that he played in just 14 games, though his per-game average that year was almost identical to his career average. His role as the team's No. 1 receiver is secure, and he's playing with the best quarterback of his career. McLaurin got to 1,096 yards despite five games where he didn't post more than 22 yards, including in each of the first two weeks of the season as Daniels acclimated to the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. Take out those five games, and McLaurin had at least 50 yards in the team's other 15 games (including playoffs), though his biggest spike week was still only 125 yards. All that is to say that he has the potential for higher highs this year and should sail over this number if those five duds turn into 35-50 yard outings this season. I'm not worried at all about Deebo Samuel stealing targets from McLaurin, as Washington lost 75 receptions between Dyami Brown and Olamide Zaccheaus this offseason, while Samuel has topped 60 catches just once in his career.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

The oldest golf tournament in the world returns to Portrush for the first time in six years with the Claret Jug set to be awarded on site Sunday for just the third time in event history.</p><p>While Xander Schauffele enters as the reigning Champion Golfer of the Year, all eyes are be focused on hometown favorite Rory McIlroy, the No. 2 golfer in the world. Having already won three tournaments this season -- including locking up his first Masters to complete the career grand slam -- it was thought McIlroy would be the clear favorite entering Royal Portrush. Instead, following a brief struggle stretch, McIlroy is second behind Scottie Scheffler on the odds boards.</p><p>McIlroy's tremendous play last week at the Scottish Open may have served as the perfect tune up for The Ulsterman, who is hoping to start hot Thursday and put to bed concerns that <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/the-open-2025-rory-mcilroy-hopes-to-wash-away-difficult-2019-memories-in-quest-for-home-win-at-royal-portrush/\" target=\"_blank\">he may eject early as he did in 2019</a></span>, the last time The Open was played on his home country's shores. The winner that year was McIlroy's best friend on the PGA Tour, Irishman Shane Lowry. He's also had an up-and-down year but always seems to come alive when placed back in the United Kingdom for a tournament.</p><p>Jon Rahm enters as the third overall favorite behind Scheffler and McIlroy. While he has yet to win on LIV Golf, Rahm has found his game after a 2024 to forget. He appears ready to claim a winner's circle and add another feather in his cap with a Claret Jug on his mantle.

The results were about as you would expect: Start with the three active guys who have most recently won national titles (Georgia's Kirby Smart, Ohio State's Ryan Day, Clemson's Dabo Swinney), move on to guys with recent top-five finishes or national title game appearances (Notre Dame's Marcus Freeman, Texas' Steve Sarkisian, Oregon's Dan Lanning, Alabama's Kalen DeBoer, Penn State's James Franklin), then squeeze in a couple of long-term overachievers at the end (Utah's Kyle Whittingham, Iowa State's Matt Campbell).</p><p>The rankings made plenty of sense, but I couldn't help but notice that the top eight coaches on the list all work for some of the richest, most well-supported programs in the country. There are some epic pressures associated with leading these programs -- <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/43500974/ohio-state-college-football-national-championship-quiets-haters\">just ask Day</a> -- but there are also major advantages. It might only take a good head coach to do great things in those jobs, while at programs with smaller alumni bases or lesser historic track records, it might take a great coach to do merely good things. They're such different jobs that it's almost impossible to even know how to compare the performance of, say, Matt Campbell to Steve Sarkisian. Could Campbell have led Texas to back-to-back CFP semifinals? Could Sark have brought ISU its first two AP top-15 finishes?</p><p>The May rankings made me want to see if there were a way to apply stats to the conversation. If you think about it, we're basically measuring two things when we're gauging coach performance: overall quality and quality relative to the expectations of the job. I thought it would be fun to come up with a blend of those two things and see what the results told us.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Performance versus expectation</h2><p>Gauging overall performance is easy enough. You could simply look at win percentage, and it would tell you quite a bit. From 2015 to 2024, the active coaches with the best FBS win percentages (minimum 30 games) were Day (.870), Lanning (.854), Swinney (.850) and Smart (.847). All ranked high in the May rankings. I tend to want to get fancy and use my SP+ ratings whenever possible, and they tell a similar tale. Looking at average SP+ ratings for the past decade, the top active coaches are Day (30.4), Smart (27.0), Lanning (22.3), Swinney (21.9), Franklin (20.3) and Freeman (19.0). They're all in the May top 10 too.</p><p>Again, though, all of those coaches are employed by college football royalty. (Granted, Swinney gets bonus points for helping Clemson turn <i>into</i> college football royalty, but still.) Isn't it more impressive to win 11 regular-season games at Indiana, as Curt Cignetti did in 2024, than to go 10-4 like Swinney did? Isn't it probably harder to finish 12th in SP+ at SMU, as Rhett Lashlee did in 2024, than to finish fifth like Franklin did?</p><p>I've begun to incorporate teams' performance against long-term averages into <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/insider/story/_/id/44138328/college-football-coaching-changes-affecting-offense-defense\">my preseason SP+ projections</a>, and it seems we could use a very similar concept to evaluate coach performances. For each year someone is a head coach, we could compare his team's SP+ rating for that season to the school's average from the 20 previous years. (If the school is newer to FBS and doesn't have a 20-year average, we can use whatever average exists to date. And for a program's first FBS season, we can simply compare the team's SP+ rating to the overall average for first-year programs.)</p><p>By this method, the 10 best single-season coaching performances of the past 20 years include Art Briles at Baylor in 2013-14, Jim Harbaugh at Stanford in 2010, Mark Mangino at Kansas in 2007, Bobby Petrino at Louisville in 2006, Greg Schiano at Rutgers in 2006 and Jamey Chadwell at Coastal Carolina in 2020 -- legendary seasons of overachievement -- plus perhaps lesser-remembered performances such as Gary Andersen at Utah State in 2012, Matt Wells at Utah State in 2018 and Brian Kelly at Cincinnati in 2007.</p><p>As far as single-season overachievement goes, that's a pretty good list. And if we look at a longer-term sample -- coaches who have led FBS programs for at least nine of the past 20 years -- here are the 15 best performance versus baseline averages.</p><p>(<i>Note: I'm looking only at performances within the past 20 years, so Nick Saban's work at LSU (2000-04) or Michigan State (1995-99), for instance, isn't included. I also went with nine years instead of 10 so Smart's current nine-year run at Georgia could be included in the sample.</i>)</p><p><strong>Best performance vs. historic baseline averages for the past 20 years (min. nine seasons):</strong></p><p>1. Chris Petersen, Boise State (2006-13) and Washington (2014-19): +12.8 points above historic baseline</p><p>2. Art Briles, Houston (2005-07) and Baylor (2008-15): +12.8</p><p>3. Gary Pinkel, Missouri (2005-15): +12.5</p><p>4. Nick Saban, Alabama (2007-23): +10.7</p><p>5. Jeff Monken, Army (2014-24): +10.3</p><p>6. Willie Fritz, Georgia Southern (2014-15), Tulane (2016-23) and Houston (2024): +10.0</p><p>7. Lance Leipold, Buffalo (2015-20) and Kansas (2021-24): +9.5</p><p>8. Bobby Petrino, Louisville (2005-06), Arkansas (2008-11), Western Kentucky (2013) and Louisville (2014-18): +9.5</p><p>9. Gary Patterson, TCU (2005-21): +8.6</p><p>10. Jim Harbaugh, Stanford (2007-10) and Michigan (2015-23): +8.5</p><p>11. Blake Anderson, Arkansas State (2014-20) and Utah State (2021-23): +8.5</p><p>12. Steve Spurrier, South Carolina (2005-15): +8.2</p><p>13. Greg Schiano, Rutgers (2005-11 and 2020-24): +7.8</p><p>14. Jeff Brohm, Western Kentucky (2014-16), Purdue (2017-22) and Louisville (2023-24): +7.7</p><p>15. David Cutcliffe, Duke (2008-21): +7.7</p><p>If we are looking for pure overachievement and aren't in the mood to reward coaches for winning at schools that always win, this is again a pretty good list. Petersen was spectacular at both Boise State and Washington, while Briles, Pinkel, Monken and Patterson all won big at schools that hadn't won big in quite a while. (Monken, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/42824521/army-wins-aac-championship-first-attempt-beating-tulane\">is still winning big</a>.) Blake Anderson's presence surprised me, but most of the names here are extremely well regarded. And Saban's presence at No. 4, despite coaching at one of the bluest of blue-blood programs, is a pretty good indicator of just how special his reign at Alabama was.</p><p>Still, looking only at performance against expectations obviously sells coaches like Saban and Smart short. Saban is probably <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/39281965/alabama-nick-saban-best-college-coach-ever\">the best head coach in the sport's history</a> but ranks <i>only</i> fourth on the above list. Meanwhile, Smart has overachieved by <i>only</i> 6.0 points above the historic baseline in his nine seasons at Georgia thanks to the high bar that predecessor Mark Richt set. But he has also won two national titles, overcoming Georgia's history of falling just short and at least briefly surpassing Saban as well. If our goal is to measure coaching prowess, we need to account for raw quality too.</p><hr><h2>The best coaches of the past 20 years</h2><p>If we combine raw SP+ averages with this performance versus baseline average, we can come up with a pretty decent overall coach rating. We can debate the weights involved, but here's what an overall rating looks like if we use 60% performance versus baseline and 40% SP+ average:</p><p>I always like to say that numbers make great starting points for a conversation, and this is a pretty good starting point. Anyone reading this would probably tweak this list to suit their own preferences, and while it probably isn't surprising that Pinkel is in the top 20, seeing him fourth, ahead of Meyer, Harbaugh and others, is a bit jarring. (I promise that this Mizzou alum didn't put his finger on the scales.) Regardless, this is a fun mix of guys who won big at big schools and guys who won pretty big at pretty big schools. That was the goal of the exercise.</p><p>Maybe the most confusing coach in this top 20 is Dabo Swinney. Clemson had enjoyed just one AP top-five finish in its history before he took over 16 years ago, and he has led the Tigers to 2 national titles, 6 top-five finishes and 7 CFP appearances. And while they haven't had a true, title-caliber team in a few years, they've still won two of the past three ACC crowns. How is he only 10th?</p><p>The main culprit for Swinney's lower-than-expected ranking is his recent performance -- it has been inferior to both national title standards and <i>his</i> standards. Since we're using a team's performance against 20-year averages, a lot of this rating is basically comparing Swinney to himself, and he hasn't quite measured up of late.</p><p>From 2012 to 2020, Swinney's average rating was an incredible 17.0, which would have ranked second to only Saban on the list above. But his average over the past four seasons is only 3.6.</p><p>Part of what made Saban so impressive was how long he managed to clear the bar he himself was setting in Tuscaloosa. Per SP+, his best team was his 14th -- the 2020 team that won his sixth and final title at Bama. While Swinney was basically matching Saban's standard 12 years into their respective tenures, Saban continued at a particularly high level for at least three more years while Swinney fell off the pace.</p><p>Comparing Saban, Swinney and Smart year by year, we see that Smart was hitting Saban-esque levels seven seasons into his tenure, but his rating has fallen off each of the past two seasons. Even Saban slipped starting in Year 15, even though he still had nearly the best program in the sport for a couple more years.</p><hr><h2>The best coaches of 2025</h2><p>Six of the top seven coaches on the list above are either retired or coaching in the NFL now, so let's focus our gaze specifically on the guys who will be leading college teams out onto the field in 2025. Using the same 20-year sample as above -- which cuts off the tenure of Iowa's Kirk Ferentz but includes everything else -- here's how the current crop of FBS head coaches has performed at the FBS level. We'll break this into two samples: the guys who have coached for at least four years in this sample and the guys who have coached between one and three years.</p><p>Our May top 10 list featured eight guys who have been head coaches for at least four years; all eight are represented on this list, including four of the top five. (Sarkisian has averaged a 13.8 rating over the past two seasons, which is a top-five level, but his overall run as head coach at Washington, USC and Texas has featured a number of ups and downs.)</p><p>Maybe the name that jumps out the most above is Josh Heupel. I think anyone would consider him a very good coach (he is 37-15 overall), but he doesn't exactly draw any \"best in the game?\" hype. He benefited from a positive situation at UCF, where he inherited a rising program from Scott Frost in 2019 and produced big ratings in his first couple of years on the job. But his average rating at Tennessee has been a solid 14.0 as well; the Volunteers had been up and down for years, but he has produced four top-20 SP+ ratings in a row and two top-10s in the past three years. He might not be getting the credit he deserves for that.</p><p>All in all, I enjoy this list. We've got mostly predictable names at the top, we've got some oldies but (mostly) goodies spread throughout, and we've got room for up-and-comers like Jeff Traylor too. This 60-40 approach probably doesn't give enough respect to the Chris Creightons of the world -- the Eastern Michigan coach has overachieved against EMU's baseline by 7.2 points per season, which is a fantastic average, but at such a hard job, his Eagles have still averaged only a minus-14.4 SP+ rating during his tenure. Still, this is a mostly solid approach.</p><p>Now let's talk about some small-sample all-stars.</p><p>Four of the top six of this list coached in the College Football Playoff last season, and while the guys ranked fifth and sixth made our May top 10 list, the guys who won big at SMU and Indiana, not Oregon and Notre Dame, take priority here. I was honestly floored that Curt Cignetti didn't make our top 10 list; he led James Madison to one of the best FBS debuts ever, going 19-4 in 2022-23, then he moved to Bloomington and led Indiana -- <i>INDIANA!</i> -- to 11 wins in his first season there.</p><p>On this list, however, Rhett Lashlee tops even Cignetti. I'm not sure we've talked enough about the job he has done at SMU. He, too, inherited a rising program, as Sonny Dykes had done some of the nitty-gritty work in getting the Mustangs back on their feet (with help from an offensive coordinator named Rhett Lashlee). SMU hadn't produced a top-50 ranking since 1985 before Dykes did so for three straight seasons (2019-21). But after holding steady in his first year replacing Dykes, Lashlee's program has ignited: 12-2 and 24th in SP+ in 2023, then 11-3 and 12th in 2024. Looking specifically at the 2021-24 range, as the game has undergone so much change, Lashlee's 16.8 average rating ranks second overall, behind only Smart (18.0) and ahead of Kiffin (15.1), Cignetti (15.0), Odom (15.0), Heupel (14.0) and Day (13.9).</p><p>Along with quite a few others here, Lashlee made <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/insider/story/_/id/39906012/kirby-smart-deion-sanders-30-coaches-define-college-football\">my 2024 list of 30 coaches</a> who would define the next decade; he'd definitely still be on the list -- along with new additions like GJ Kinne and perhaps Fran Brown -- if I remade that list today.</p>\n</div></div>"

But his play under the brightest of lights has left something to be desired. He hasn't beaten Ohio State or Michigan, he delivered some good moments in a Big Ten championship game loss to Oregon but was still intercepted twice, and threw the crucial interception in a CFP semifinal loss to Notre Dame. Penn State has made the necessary investments around Allar, who will share a backfield with probably the nation's top running back tandem. The time has come for the senior to be at his best in the biggest moments. If he delivers, Penn State will have a real chance at its first national title since 1986. -- <em>Adam Rittenberg</em></p><hr><h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/228.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"> 2. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"02382072-a5a3-24ff-6bd1-422a029bd33c\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/228/clemson-tigers\">Clemson Tigers</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> Run defense</p><p>Though the Tigers have had standout players across their front seven over the past few years, that group has fallen short in one particular area -- rush defense -- and it became glaring last season. The truth is, its decline began when Wes Goodwin took over as defensive coordinator. In each of his three seasons, the rush defense has gotten worse, culminating in what became a major issue in 2024. Clemson gave up 160.6 yards on the ground, and there isn't much more proof needed as to how poorly the Tigers attempted to stop the run than their playoff loss to Texas, when the Longhorns rushed for 292 yards. Clemson tackled poorly and often took bad angles. This season Tom Allen takes over after leading one of the best rushing defenses in the country at Penn State. Expect this area to be vastly improved, returning to the standard Clemson set under Brent Venables. -- <em>Andrea Adelson</em></p><hr><h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/251.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\">3. <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"013a8bab-0dd5-f6a0-45e6-1128a124f34b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/251/texas-longhorns\">Texas Longhorns</a></h2><p><strong>X factor:</strong> Middle of the defensive line</p><p>Texas has been loaded the past two seasons, but one of the reasons it made back-to-back CFP semifinal trips were the big men in the middle of the defensive line.

Covered the L.A. Rams for ESPN from 2016 to 2018 and the L.A. Angels for MLB.com from 2012 to 2016.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p>ATLANTA -- The back section of the Coca-Cola Roxy, a small concert venue that hosted the first round of Major League Baseball's draft, was cordoned off with stanchions Sunday night. Gray couches had been arranged for draft hopefuls to lounge alongside their traveling parties while waiting for their names to be called by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, but there was one distinct problem:</p><p>Nobody was in them.</p><p>Four years ago, MLB pushed its draft back, paired it with the rest of its All-Star Game festivities and envisioned a grander affair, with fans in attendance, a national audience watching and players, outfitted with lavish suits, approaching the stage to don their first professional caps and jerseys. But between only six and eight players showed each year from 2021 to 2024. And this year, with the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"122673a3-bf06-4432-6950-b8a32e52ac2e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves\">Atlanta Braves</a> and Truist Park serving as hosts, player attendance was reduced to nothing. One or two amateurs expressed interest in going and were told not to bother.</p><p>In MLB's mind, one or two was worse than zero.</p><p>Two days later, while fielding questions from members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Manfred touted the \"progress\" of MLB's draft product, praising both the broadcast and the atmosphere of its most recent version, but acknowledged that player attendance is \"obviously an important part.\"</p><p>\"Some of it is luck of the draw,\" Manfred said Tuesday. \"Some agencies take the position that they don't want their players there for reasons they'll have to explain to you. I can't. Because I believe it's an important step in terms of marketing a player and making him a star when he gets to the big leagues. Having said that, they give the advice they give.\"</p><p>Three agencies in particular that have been identified by league officials as dissuading clients from attending MLB's draft are The Boras Corporation, Excel Sports Management and Wasserman, which combined to represent 18 of this year's top 30 picks.</p><p>Representatives from each of the three agencies denied possessing a hard-and-fast rule preventing players from attending the draft, stating that those decisions ultimately rest with their clients. But those agencies, as well as other agents throughout the industry, did identify two key reasons why some of their clients ultimately don't attend.</p><p>One is that amateurs, particularly those who just graduated high school, don't want to subject themselves to the public shame of potentially seeing their names fall in the draft, preferring instead to host draft parties surrounded by friends and family members from home. Another, more prominent reason is that the MLB draft's economic landscape disincentivizes it.</p><p>Each selection within the first 10 rounds comes with an assigned value, but teams are free to divide their total draft bonus pools however they would like. Signing bonuses, then, are subject to negotiations. And those talks often take place minutes before players are selected, potentially influencing whether teams take them at certain spots. After that, deals still need to be finalized. Scott Boras, baseball's most influential agent, believes attending a draft can hinder leverage.</p><p>\"I have players that are drafted, and they still have to negotiate their contracts,\" Boras said. \"You can't go out there and parade in front of a live audience saying, 'I am with the team,' without knowing that they are going to be with the team. We still have other options.\"</p><p>High school players can choose to attend the universities they are already committed to, a bigger draw with the money generated through name, image and likeness deals. College juniors can opt to return for their senior years. All of them can decline the bonuses offered by teams.</p><p>\"The nature of our unique draft system and the culture of the amateur players is the reason why they mostly choose not to attend,\" Joel Wolfe, an executive vice president on the baseball side at Wasserman, wrote in a text message. \"Our first round is so unpredictable -- there's probably 50 to 80 kids that think they might get taken. Players aren't selected simply in order of their highest value or ranking. There's a lot more that happens leading right up to the moment they're selected.\"</p><p>Last year, three of the top 12 and six of the top 24 players selected were present at the draft. In each of the previous three years, one of the players in attendance was taken within the first six picks, including two <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"5b8fc9be-4020-52c6-aa28-9a0f2d4383e0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-pirates\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> selections, <a data-player-guid=\"18de9dda-642a-3886-a141-98d7d9419545\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4418683/henry-davis\">Henry Davis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/5080632/termarr-johnson\">Termarr Johnson</a>, who went first and fourth, respectively. This year, even though 12 of the first 30 players drafted were either from Georgia or a neighboring state, none showed up.</p><p>\"Sad,\" said a player rep who is not affiliated with any of the aforementioned agencies.</p><p>\"Embarrassing,\" said another.</p><p>But outside of sizable economic changes that would trigger hard slots in the draft -- one that would have to wait until negotiations restart for a new collective bargaining agreement, with the current one expiring after the 2026 season -- the league doesn't seem to possess many options.</p><p>This year, MLB upped its incentive package in hopes of luring more draft hopefuls. They offered six round-trip flights, three hotel rooms and six tickets to the Home Run Derby and All-Star Game, along with the opportunity to chat with players during batting practice, attend the Red Carpet Show, meet Hall of Famers and celebrities and be featured on the league's social media channels, among other perks. Clearly, it wasn't enough.</p><p>Manfred said he has had conversations with representatives from some of the more prominent agencies \"in an effort to create an understanding that this is part of a broader player-marketing effort that starts with the combine, continues through the draft, continues through adding minor league baseball games to MLB.TV so people can see these young players, and then making a big deal out of it when they get their chance in the big leagues.\"</p><p>The path from the amateur ranks to the major leagues can be long and arduous, with few exceptions. It will probably be at least three years before the vast majority of the 615 players drafted Sunday and Monday reach the highest level of their profession, if they make it at all.</p><p>That lack of instant gratification is among the obvious reasons why the MLB draft will never come close to reaching the popularity of the NFL and NBA versions, two sports that also give teams less flexibility with draft signing bonuses. College basketball and college football are also far more popular than college baseball, making fans more invested in players leading up to when their names are called.</p><p>The MLB draft drew 863,000 viewers across ESPN and MLB Network in 2024, its second-largest audience and roughly three times greater than what it typically attracted in prior decades. But even its best ratings are dwarfed by the NFL and NBA, which drew 13.6 and 3.8 million viewers to its 2025 drafts, respectively. MLB officials have no illusions of someday reaching those numbers. What they would like, though, is for the players, and their reps, to be more invested in making the draft feel important.</p><p>One agent suggested paying players for attending, like they do major leaguers who take part in the Home Run Derby. Another suggested cutting off communication between teams and their agents once a draft starts, eliminating a lot of the chaos before picks are made.</p><p>Otherwise, in the words of another agent, \"It makes more sense for them to be home with their family around them when calls are rolling in. It's very stressful.\"</p><p><em>ESPN's Kiley McDaniel contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</div></div>"

The pair had a lengthy chat, during the course of which the conversation turned to the psychology around the thunderous State of Origin games of a quarter of a century ago.</p><p>The Queensland sides of that era were often viewed by outsiders as underdogs but within their own dressing room it was very different. Tallis told Farrell the Maroons never saw themselves in that light, offering a timely reminder that this Lions series could still unfold differently to how many people expect. “Australia will be [thinking] exactly the same,” cautioned Farrell, having finally confirmed his first Test lineup. “It’s the same as us being favourites. It’s about your preparation and how you get down to performing and that’s all that matters.”</p><p>Farrell, in short, has been around enough Australian opposition to remain on red alert despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/17/wallabies-call-on-champion-de-crespigny-for-surprise-debut-in-lions-opener\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">a Wallaby team sheet</a> which, at first glance, contains more holes than a battered old colander.

If they intend to rival the legendary Wallaby sides of yesteryear, not least those that featured Lynagh’s father, Michael, this depleted mob still have some way to travel.</p><figure id=\"5e46aa5f-6673-4968-8226-df95a9242616\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Australia’s Nick Champion de Crespigny catches a ball\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ae3f067c712615f175add37a83da64f48342e/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.6026747195858\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Australia’s Nick Champion de Crespigny catches a ball during a training session ahead of the first Test against the British and Irish Lions.</span> Photograph: Jono Searle/AP</figcaption></figure><p>That said, De Crespigny is one to keep an eye on – “He’s a psycho, he loves contact,” revealed his teammate Fraser McReight approvingly – and the Wallabies still possess a decent lineout and a gritty front five.

More media attention means more bums on seats, more ticket sales, more money into the game,\" Cross said.</p><p>\"But it's really difficult to replicate the pressure you're under in a match, to a training session – no matter how hard you try, it will never feel the same as doing it in front of 10,000 people at Old Trafford or wherever.</p><p>\"It's just not quite transitioning from training on to the pitch yet but I really don't feel like we are that far away from it looking a whole lot better. </p><p>\"The narrative is that we have to be perfect.

Back then, it went pretty well; after all, he'd been practicing for years.</p><p>It was November 2020, and it was an unexpected choice, perhaps, but not a chance one; this was a track that connected Cardoso to home in Brazil, another time. And, he hoped, it would connect him here: a new time, a new place. There was something practical about it, too. \"I'm at a payphone, trying to call home; all of my change, I spent on you.\" There were many words Johnny didn't know in English -- many he still doesn't -- but these were words he did; words he had heard so often, that meant something. Sitting in the sunshine, recalling that moment and many more, he smiles.</p><p>\"When I was in Porto Alegre, my dad would come and get me on the bus, this was the music we would listen to, so it was already in my head,\" he tells ESPN, speaking Spanish, earlier this summer before his move from <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/244/real-betis\">Real Betis</a> to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/1068\">Atlético Madrid</a> was completed.</p><p>The first time he heard the song, Johnny was a kid 200 miles from home, chasing a dream and, as he puts it, \"living alone and facing a pressure someone that age shouldn't live with.\"</p><p>Some days he thought he couldn't do it and just wanted to go back, calling his parents in tears. They would come whenever they could, all the way from Criciúma, and help him through it. Now, here he was standing before the USMNT, <i>his</i> team, for the first time. Standing on a chair, singing the same song. \"Where have the times gone? Yeah, I know it's hard to remember the people we used to be.\" He didn't speak English, but he could sing this, and the team would understand.</p><p>This time, it will be different. It will when it comes to the track, at least. As for the rest of it, well, that should be easier, even after a frustrating summer with the USMNT. At club level, Atlético is a step up: a new beginning, a bigger club: more pressure, a different style of play. But they are convinced by him, working to convince Betis and the player to turn their backs on a deal that gave <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/367/tottenham-hotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> priority. This feels like the right move to him, too. especially with the biggest prize of all awaiting at the end of his debut season: playing at the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/fifa.world\">FIFA World Cup</a>, for the hosts.</p><p>Spain has been home for a year now and the language here is no barrier, his Spanish spoken softly, almost gently, the slightest hint of a lisp and Brazilian touch. Besides, if anything has defined Cardoso it is that each new step, each new challenge, is met. Even if it does mean standing on a chair and singing.</p><p>Start again? Okay, then. He's done it before. Here's Johnny.</p><hr><p>If you're curious about what connected the Brazilian named João Lucas de Souza Cardoso -- who grew up in Santa Catarina state, developed as a player with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/1936/internacional\">Internacional</a> of Porto Alegre, moved to Real Betis in Spain and doesn't speak English -- to the United States, well, he was too. So his parents showed him.</p><p>\"I'm a boy who comes from a Brazilian family,\" Johnny says. \"My father and mother went to live in the U.S. I was born there [in Denville, N.J.] but left after just three months. It was the time of the attack on the Twin Towers: That was September 11, and I was born on September 20. But very soon, we went back to Brazil, and that's where I grew up. My family was very into sport and my dream since I was small was football. My dad had been a goalkeeper, although not professionally. I played, like every kid in Brazil. I didn't have memories [of the U.S.]. And then one day we went back and visited the house where I had lived.</p><p>\"We went up to the house and knocked at the door and met the people living there now. If I remember right, they were a Mexican family. We took some pictures of the house, we went to the hospital where I was born. And my mom and dad started telling me stories about our life there. Those are very nice memories. They told me the things they had been through there, all about their life, the time spent in that house, and I really felt it.</p><p>\"They work in ceramics now in Brazil but when they lived in the U.S., my dad delivered pizzas. He worked on building sites. They lived there for four years in all. My dad went first, then mom went to join him, looking for work as well. They had gone looking for a dream. It is somewhere they had always wanted to live, and the opportunity came up. They were there for four years in total. They went, came back to Brazil for a bit and then returned. And it was in that second spell that I was born.</p><p>\"My dad started calling me Johnny and eventually everyone knew me as Johnny. It started as something fun, but it stuck. It's weird for me now if anyone calls me João, and I don't even react; ever since I was a kid, it was, 'Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...' I like that. It's like my thing, a trademark, my identity and I'm happy with it.\"</p><p>The obvious question remains, though: why? Why America? Why not Brazil? Johnny says he always knew he <i>could</i> play for the U.S. because he had been born there, but never thought he <i>would</i>. Never really thought about it at all in fact. And when the call came, it wasn't really a case of making a choice, of agonizing over it; it was the logical next step. There was a connection, an opportunity.</p><p>\"The first time was with the U23s, and from there I kept getting the chance,\" he says. \"I had no doubts, no decision to make. I didn't have the opportunity with Brazil, I didn't have anyone coming to talk to me. It was just natural. And every time I go, I love it more and try to be more part of it.</p><p>\"The first time was hard. I was very, very nervous with the language, which I didn't speak at all. I left [Criciúma] young and didn't really have the chance to learn English with my mom and dad [at home]. I took classes in Porto Alegre and I'm still taking them now. But to really speak English you have to practice, you have to be surrounded by it. I try. Of course I try. I watch films in English. I listen to English in music. I love music in English.\"</p><p>Which is where the story comes out, standing on a chair singing \"Payphone.\" \"My dad always listened to U2, to Maroon 5. He has good taste.\" Johnny laughs, then concedes: \"It's not the typical footballer taste.\"</p><p>Music has also helped him with his English. \"I learn more than doing classes,\" he says. It's not easy, but his efforts have not gone unnoticed by his teammates. \"He's a really good guy: He's quiet but he always trains well,\" U.S. teammate <a data-player-guid=\"5fa1c04a-96b6-8ced-9461-3f643256caf0\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/225609/luca-de-la-torre\">Luca de la Torre</a> says, while <a data-player-guid=\"1ba45b72-8edb-3bd7-a0db-460d6dc67f56\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/303512/jack-mcglynn\">Jack McGlynn</a> adds, \"He always has a smile on his face, trying to make friends with all the new faces here.\"</p><p>Johnny recalls, \"The first time I went, I couldn't speak any [English] really, but I had a clear idea in my head: 'I'm going to play football. [Even] If I can't communicate with them off the pitch, on the pitch I will.' And that was how it went. ... There were players who speak Spanish and that helps a lot. They all really welcomed me.\"</p><p>Then there's USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, who is from Argentina. \"That helps a bit,\" Johnny says. \"But, honestly? It depends on me and my football. It's not the language that will put me on the pitch to play. Him having Spanish can help me a bit, but my mentality is always on the pitch, trying to do my best, trying to improve technically, physically, mentality. I'm there to help my teammates. It's about what I can offer on the pitch.\"</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45589128\" data-cerebro-id=\"685d401dedba926edab6e4fc\" data-title=\"Marcotti: Atlético Madrid a big step up for Johnny Cardoso\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0626%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0626%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0626%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26%2Fdm_250626_COM_SOC_Analysis_Marcotti3A_AtlC3A9tico_Madrid_a_big_step_up_for_Johnny_Cardoso__GLOBAL_2025%2D06%2D26.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45589128\">play</span><figcaption><p>0:49</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Marcotti: Atlético Madrid a big step up for Johnny Cardoso</p><p>Gab Marcotti believes Johnny Cardoso's proposed move from Real Betis to Atlético Madrid is a \"big step up\" for the USMNT midfielder.</p></div></div><p>It hasn't been the best summer, he knows; illness and an ankle injury reduced Cardoso to just 11 minutes in the group stage of the <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/league/_/name/concacaf.gold\">Concacaf Gold Cup </a>and not one after that as the hosts reached the final, where they lost to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/203/mexico\">Mexico</a>. This isn't the way it was supposed to be; it is also not, he trusts, the way it will be.</p><p>But there is time, qualities that come from a combination of influences; there's a thoughtfulness about the game that is immediately obvious too. At that first U.S. call-up, former coach Gregg Berhalter said he could \"tell\" Cardoso was Brazilian, and there was something in that, something in his development. He saw a hint of the street footballer in the midfielder, a toughness to go with the technique, a physical ability that set him apart. Some of it was natural, some of it taught. In Spain, there has been a \"Europeanization\" of his game, an expansion of it, an increasingly proactive role at Betis, versatility too.</p><p>\"He's just such a quality player,\" McGlynn says. \"He's very talented; there's nothing he lacks.\" That is one of many reasons why Atlético coach Diego Simeone wanted him, opening the doors to the elite.</p><p>Cardoso looks to one of Brazil's all-time great for inspiration, even if his own evolution took him to a deeper part of the pitch. \"My idol was [2007 Ballon d'Or winner] Kaká,\" Cardoso says. \"I love him as a player and all the more so as a person. The way he speaks about life, his mentality, is very similar to mine, I think. Now I take inspiration from players who play in my position. [<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/121893/sergio-busquets\">Sergio] Busquets</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"2c074cad-04d2-d28d-6162-276e9e8df549\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231828/rodri\">Rodri</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"b45856db-7abf-3a50-bdaf-251ea427b2b1\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/301894/thiago\">Thiago</a>.</p><p>\"I started playing futsal at 7 then I changed to big pitches at 11, 12. That was an important point and it helped me a lot: the short game, the intensity, and then moving onto something more open. I started as a forward, and I ended up in a position that's more defensive, but I think [having] the whole package is very positive: that you take things from things from a forward, the skills, the quality, and add other aspects.\"</p><p>Betis had seen something in him, enough from his five years at Internacional to sign him in January 2024. The club's sporting director Manu Fajardo tells ESPN: \"Because of his physical capacity and his technical ability, he can break from those deeper positions and reach the opposition's area. I see a balance in him, a player capable of performing in both phases of the game.\"</p><p>Context is everything, Cardoso says: \"In some moments I am more defensive, but I can also be a No. 8, a box-to-box midfielder who reaches the area and scores goals, too.\"</p><p>The context? A European giant, aspiring to everything. A loyal, noisy fan base, 70,000 fans packing out the Metropolitano, as much a cause as a club. Like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/uefa.champions\">Champions League</a> football every week.</p><p>For Simeone, he is the perfect pivot for the heart of the side, a man capable of protecting the defence and moving the midfield but also having the versatility to fulfil other roles. The Argentine coach has been asking for a No. 5 for a long time; now, at last, he has him. There is perhaps a touch of the Thiago about him, that combination of quiet efficiency and understated intelligence, plus the physicality to cover a lot of ground.</p><p>It is a role few know better than Mario Suárez, who played for Atlético for five years, including under Simeone, winning six titles and reaching a Champions League final.</p><p>\"I think Johnny Cardoso is not just a good signing for Atlético Madrid, he's a necessary one,\" Suárez tells ESPN. \"He's good with the ball, he is strong in duels, wins a lot of balls, and presses very well, especially on the front foot, stepping forward to press -- which is why I'm interested to see how he adapts to those phases when Atlético play in a lower block, which they like to do with Simeone, give that he's more comfortable pressing forwards, into the other team's space. In those phases he will have to hold his position more, and that may require some adaptation.\"</p><p>\"He's a great signing who can bring a lot to Atlético, who also may help open the U.S. market. He's young, he's very dynamic, he's good in the air, he has scored goals from set plays. He's very complete.</p><p>\"I think we'll see him play a more defensive role than <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/174466/rodrigo-de-paul\">Rodrigo De Paul</a> or <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/336634/pablo-barrios\">Pablo Barrios</a>. That said, if Atlético do transfer players, if De Paul goes, it could be that they also sign a more purely positional defensive midfielder as a No. 5, and Johnny plays a little more free.\"</p><p>Nothing is guaranteed. It doesn't always end well, Cardoso knows. It doesn't always start well, either. In the U.S.'s pre-Gold Cup friendly against <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e83058ba-378d-6837-d3f9-293eca20f889\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=465\">Turkey</a>, it could hardly have gone worse; <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_uyYnAGtv2g?si=NZY8TuWtGIFB7kkf&amp;t=110\" target=\"_blank\">a bizarre mistake gifting a goal</a> when, trying to bring the ball out from deep, he struck the ball against <a data-player-guid=\"5a8c6503-7351-3f24-87d6-a4304220e6bb\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/310452/arda-guler\">Arda Güler</a> and it rebounded into his own net. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/734219\" target=\"_blank\">The 2-1 loss</a>, a third successive defeat for the USMNT, deepened doubts. For some, at least.</p><p>\"These things can happen,\" De la Torre said. \"He has the personality to get the ball in difficult situations and make things happen. And yeah, I mean, the guy tackles him and it comes in off the post. It's unlucky and it can happen, but of course he gives more to the team than just that mistake. I thought he played well.\"</p><p>\"Today was just a fluke, he'll be fine,\" <a data-player-guid=\"8c60bb07-3fc0-60ad-20fc-207e6fc1f566\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/286778/nathan-harriel\">Nathan Harriel</a> added, while Pochettino, called it \"part of his growth, part of learning.\"</p><p>Johnny will learn; there is a quietness, almost a timidity in him as Cardoso talks, but there's a toughness too. Fajardo calls him \"polite, well-mannered ... and resilient.\"</p><p>\"Johnny is a brave boy, if you think about it,\" Berhalter said when Cardoso joined the senior USMNT in September 2022. \"He doesn't speak perfect English, he's 19 years old, he's had the farthest to travel to get here. But he's still embracing everything and taking everything in stride. He's a great person, a very good player.\"</p><p><i>Brave</i>. \"I think it's a word that could define me, yes,\" Johnny says. \"I'm very resilient, I'm not scared of things. And I remember that first time very clearly.\"</p><p>There's a smile. It was strange? \"Yes,\" he says. That's one word for it. The first training session Cardoso ever had with the national team wasn't with the national team at all; it was just him and the coaches in the rain. He had traveled from Brazil, leaving two days before to be certain he would get there, and arrived a day before anyone else. \"None of the other players had got there,\" he recalls. When they did, it was time to get up on that chair.</p><p>Confidence can take a while but, he says, \"I think bravery is something you have inside you, but I also think it's something you can work on. I always had the desire to learn. I always put an idea in my head: 'I'm not the best now, but it's work,' you know? You have to be strong.\" He could be quoting from the book of Simeone.</p><p>He had to find that bravery from an early age.</p><p>\"I was 12 the first time I went to Inter,\" he says. \"It was 300 kilometers from home. I wasn't allowed to live there yet because I was too young. That first year I would stay a week per month training with the team and then go home. It was a way of getting used to it, adapting, like an internship. But at the end of the year, the coach said 'if you want to play the games, the tournaments, you have to be here all the time.'</p><p>\"My mom and dad always supported me but a mother's heart when her child leaves home at 13 ... it's very difficult and I was always very, very close to my family. That first year I had days when I called them up crying -- 'I want to go home,' 'I can't take any more of this.' The role of my mom and dad was the most important thing. However much their hearts said 'come home,' they knew this was my dream, and they would say, 'No problem, we'll come and spend the day with you there, we'll be there, things will get better, it'll be OK.'</p><p>\"I lived in a house with maybe 25 players, aged between 13 and 20. It was madness. Imagine it: I get there at 13 and I'm in a room with five in these little beds. There are two bathrooms for 25 kids. Two women lived there who did the cleaning, prepared the food, as if they were the mothers. My grandad would go and be there with me a week, or my dad would come. To start with it was very difficult, but it's an incredible experience, something totally new. You encounter lots of different realities, it's an education, you learn.\"</p><p>When asked if, of all those boys, if he was the one that got the furthest, Johnny pauses. He thinks for a bit, a mental list forming, faces and names. Some were only there for a few months, some are long gone. \"I think so,\" he says.</p><p>There is a universal truth, too easily overlooked: The worst player on the worst team you have ever seen is <i>brilliant</i>. There might be no profession in the world more competitive, where making it is so hard. Those that do have something special about them, and it's not necessarily in their feet; more often it is in their mind. Listening to Johnny -- calm, analytical, clear -- you can hear it.</p><p>\"There are lots of kids I played within the academy up to 17, 18, that were great players,\" he says. \"People I looked at and thought, 'Wow, there's no way they won't make it.' Players you think, he's so good technically, physically he's an animal.</p><p>\"But what happened? Mentally they didn't have it. That's the hardest part: to be strong, to know how to handle it all, live with it.\"</p><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45724780\" data-cerebro-id=\"6872a4b3f9cb241c51c4b762\" data-title=\"USMNT's Tillman admits 'mixed feelings' over swapping PSV for Leverkusen\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0712%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0712%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0712%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen%2Fdm_250712_USMNTs_Tillman_admits_mixed_feelings_over_swapping_PSV_for_Leverkusen.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45724780\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:59</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>USMNT's Tillman admits 'mixed feelings' over swapping PSV for Leverkusen</p><p>USMNT midfielder Malik Tillman talks to ESPN after confirming his switch from PSV to Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen.</p></div></div><p>When USMNT captain <a data-player-guid=\"4d70b696-ec86-7ac2-2239-881e594c538f\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/222776/tyler-adams\">Tyler Adams</a> is asked what stands out about Cardoso, he says: \"The way he trains every single day, the way that he brings his mentality every single day. ... He's going to be an important player.\" The errors? All part of the process. As Pochettino says: \"Now the most important thing is to quickly go to the next page.\" Everything in Cardoso's career says that too. Lessons were learned and still are, daily. The pressure, Johnny says, can be intense.</p><p>Just how intense comes up when he discusses what it was like to be in the middle of the swirl of rumours, what it is like to see your name occupy the sports pages and everything that comes with being the new hope with the national team, and a new club.</p><p>And yet, as he talks, a picture forms that says it is more than that, at once simpler and more complex; it is not just this club or that one, this moment or the next, which is perhaps why he deals with each step, the bad moments, so naturally: it is the whole thing. The life, not just the game. The mind, not just the play. And that is worked upon too.</p><p>\"What I most try to work on is the mentality, closing my eyes to the bad things. And also ... look, I wouldn't say close your eyes to the good things. Who doesn't like to hear nice things? But if you focus on that you won't [get anywhere]. Sometimes if you keep looking when things are good and everything's nice, if you keep going, keep going to the bottom you're going to find a bad one and a bad one. ... You'll always find it, and it will finish you.</p><p>\"So I don't have Twitter, I try not to spend much time on social media. Look, of course I like to read nice things but maybe you read one, two ... and then I try to get out of there because otherwise your head starts to say, 'Now I'm going to have a look and see what they're saying over here.'</p><p>\"And there will always be bad things because in the end you can't please everyone. That's what happens with a lot of young people and it upsets them. It happened to me when I played my first game at Inter. I played, went off, picked up the phone to see what people had said, and it was the worst thing that I could have done.</p><p>\"I have support from my mom and dad, always. But since I was 15, I've been working with a psychologist too. Because of everything really: living alone in Porto Alegre, living with a pressure that you shouldn't have to live with at that age, reading things about you that are from another world, from people who have no head. ... I learnt a lot with that. And I still have psychology sessions once a week. I also have my mom and dad here with me and my wife now.</p><p>From Denville, New Jersey, to Madrid, via Brazil and Seville.</p>\n</div></div>"

Defender <a data-player-guid=\"3453ed78-cb11-e82f-316d-509c9ef6372a\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/272585/chris-richards\">Chris Richards</a> was the team's best and most consistent player at the Gold Cup, and now he's a near-lock to be in the lineup when the <a data-league-guid=\"34f478c4-cf9a-35da-abd5-33db021e09d2\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/FIFA.WORLD\">FIFA World Cup</a> starts in less than a year's time.</p><p>That wasn't the case six weeks ago.</p><p>Heading into the Gold Cup, there was a question mark surrounding the starting center back pairing, as both spots seemed to be up for grabs. In Richards' case, he had long been expected to emerge as a mainstay in the U.S. lineup for this cycle, but his performances at international level never quite matched his club form. The 2024 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/conmebol.america\">Copa América</a> was a disappointment. Richards' passing lacked its usual sharpness, and he wasn't as consistent in his defending either. The fourth-place finish at the 2025 Concacaf Nations League was underwhelming as well.</p><p>A stellar second half of the season with <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e8703d92-a160-9bbf-cb81-1be6f3fd7969\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=384\">Crystal Palace</a> saw the 25-year-old hit peak form, though, and Richards carried that level of play into the Gold Cup. His performances were on point throughout the competition, composed in his defending and even chipping in with a pair of goals off of set pieces, including one in the 2-1 defeat to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9e213fae-5b9d-d331-8b4b-33abdaf57b4f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=203\">Mexico</a> in the final.</p><p>Following that match, Richards' disappointment was evident. He even admitted he threw away his runner-up medal before he even got to the postmatch mixed zone. But he did take time to reflect on what the Gold Cup meant for him personally.</p><p>\"It's something that I challenged myself with going into this tournament. I wanted to be that guy that stepped up and cemented my spot, and I think maybe I've done that,\" Richards said after the match. \"But also, every camp I come into from now on is just another stepping stone. I have to keep working and keep playing,\"</p><p>Now the Hoover, Alabama native is one of the first names on Pochettino's team sheet, and his play has caught the attention of his teammates, too.</p><p>\"Just watching [Richards] now play, he's actually taking over. He's doing the things that I think we all really, really have expected him to do and expected him to become as a center back,\" fellow defender <a data-player-guid=\"b9b826c5-6593-d43d-806e-7704da069e30\" href=\"http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/146290/tim-ream\">Tim Ream</a> told ESPN. \"He's still very young, and he's still learning and just watching him, watching his growth over the past two years, really has been great to see.\"</p><p>Ream noted that becoming a dad changed how he viewed himself as a player and motivated him in a positive way. He feels that Richards has undergone a similar transformation since the birth of his daughter, Luna -- an assertion Richards doesn't dispute.</p><p>\"[Becoming a father], it's changed my priorities,\" Richards told ESPN. \"It has definitely made me work a little bit harder because at the end of the day, I have to provide for her and my girlfriend as well. It makes you want to work 10% -- f--- it, 100% -- harder.\"</p><p>Players often talk about the grind of the season, how the constant work put in often leads to a series of incremental improvements that lead to success, but a campaign can also hinge on moments. For Richards, that point came last October.</p><p>Palace had won one league match in the season's first two-and-a-half months and a hamstring injury saw Richards lose his spot in the starting lineup. The season was drifting away from him. It was then that a conversation with Palace assistant Paddy McCarthy, himself a former Palace defender, helped turn Richards' season around.</p><p>\"He just told me straight up, 'What do you want to do with your career? What do you want to do while you're at Palace? Do you want to just be one of those guys who just goes through the motions, or do you want to be a guy who aspires to go to a higher caliber club?'\" Richards told ESPN. \"He was like, 'I see it in you. I see that you can go to higher caliber [clubs]. You have a lot of attributes that I couldn't even dream of having, but at the end of the day, you have to want it. I can't want it for you.'\"</p><p>McCarthy provided some tactical advice as well, encouraging Richards to drop \"as deep as you need to\" in order to get the ball, that way passing lanes would open up more easily.</p><p>\"It was something that at the time, I think it hurt a little bit,\" Richards said about that conversation. \"But it was something that I needed, not just as a man, but as an athlete and a professional athlete. It's something that can either make or break you, and I was kind of ready for that moment. I was ready to take the next step, so I had to take it on the chin, and just keep moving forward.\"</p><p>Richards returned to the Palace lineup in late November, becoming an ever-present force and making 32 appearances in all competitions. He finished off his season with that remarkable day in May at Wembley in the FA Cup final, with Palace prevailing 1-0 over <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"94fd5d7e-35b1-9d52-c9f2-4a37259bea36\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=382\">Manchester City</a> to win the first major trophy in Palace's history.</p><p>\"It was an amazing season for the club, but for me personally, I think being a part of the club that made history like that, also being the only player having played every minute in the cup run, and I think just all in all getting a lot of games under my belt, it was really beneficial for me,\" Richards said.</p><p>Richards noted that the talk with McCarthy was reminiscent of those he had as a 16-year-old playing for Texans SC Houston under current <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"fa2f128b-c698-3d43-2910-5561f4442748\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=185\">FC Dallas</a> manager Eric Quill. It was Quill who plucked Richards out of Alabama and brought him to Houston, where his U18 team won a national championship. (The other center back on that team? Now-<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a> placekicker <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4689936/jake-bates\">Jake Bates</a>.)</p><p>Quill recalls how he knew early on that Richards was destined to become a pro, even after he was initially turned down for FC Dallas' academy. Richards had the body movements of a point guard, which he played earlier in his youth, taking after his father, Ken, as well as Quill.</p><p>\"His aerial ability was incredible,\" Quill said about Richards. \"His reading of the game was of the highest nature because he never had to get into a full sprint half the time because he read the games so quickly, and any kind of channel duels that he would get in with wingers, nobody ever could beat him. And then I saw a few times the fifth gear that he could get into where I was like, 'Well, that's really top-end speed.'\"</p><p>Quill has kept track of Richards' career, from his eventual entry to FC Dallas' academy, to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"25b5e432-d3d2-939f-f73b-6e531a6fbd91\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=132\">Bayern Munich</a>, to <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"6a9e82af-cafc-b66b-3e64-0ea38a6faef0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=7911\">TSG Hoffenheim</a> and eventually Palace. Quill's assessment of why Richards has found that next level is simple: health.</p><p>\"I think he's been in [the lineup], he gets injured, goes back on the shelf, comes back. I just think when you start to get that really good form is typically when you've had a long run of games and you got that fluidity and that rhythm,\" Quill said. \"And I think that's why his game is soaring right now and he's exuding a lot of confidence in everything he's doing.\"</p><p>That includes stepping into a leadership role this summer with the USMNT. With the roster composed mostly of younger players who were inexperienced at international level, there was a need for players delivering strong performances and strong voices. Ream's steady, calming presence has long made him one of the team's leaders, but he couldn't do it alone. Richards has since stepped in and helped the team in that regard.</p><p>\"He's never been one that just sits there and is quiet, but now listening to him in a game, he's so much more vocal, he's so much more commanding,\" Ream said of Richards. \"His positioning has gotten exponentially better, and that just comes with experience. He's going to continue to get better and better, which is scary.\"</p><p>Richards says that he's gotten to the point where he feels comfortable in a leadership role. The nature of the center back position often requires directing teammates and being demanding. That is something Richards has long enjoyed, but his level of play has given him more credibility.</p><p>\"You have to lead by example as well, and I think that's something that I feel like I do,\" he said.</p><p>Next year's World Cup is never far from Richards' mind. He missed out on the 2022 edition due to a hamstring injury. He has every intention of being there in 2026.</p><p>\"It really hurt not to be a part of the '22 squad, whether it was the memories that the guys made along the way, or just the performances that they put in as well,\" he said. \"But me personally, I want to be a part of that. I want to be a part of history, and I want to be a part of winning history, the right set of history. So I think for me, this is a huge year for me, for club and country, but I think just doing all the right things at my club so that when it comes to playing for the U.S. that I'm available and I'm ready and I'm at the highest level that I can possibly be.\"</p><p>Richards is well on his way.</p>\n</div></div>"

Pollock has even talked about being “the best Lions team ever” – a claim that has gone down badly among a host of former Wallabies including Chris Latham.</p><p>Asked if he wants his players to walk towards the pressure that comes with such expectation, Farrell said: “One hundred percent. Why wouldn’t you? At the end of the day you’re just getting on with building your own belief, your own confidence as a team. And it goes both ways. Australia will be exactly the same.</p><p>“You’re walking around town and you can already feel it heating up and it will only ramp up tomorrow, so it’s making sure we do everyone proud here and at home with the type of performance that is one that’s going to walk forward to the challenge and be the best version of ourselves.</p><p>“There’s no overconfidence at all. It’s having an inner confidence within our group that we are going to go execute the plan when it matters. There’s a realisation of what it is and what it means and how privileged we are but that does not get in the way of how we prepare to make sure that we allow ourselves to be the best version of ourselves.</p><p>“If you’re in a position where it comes down to this every 12 years and you get to pull the shirt on for the Wallabies and the privilege that goes with that, representing your country, they’ll be fighting tooth and nail, won’t they.”</p><p>Farrell’s team selection was expected with Curry favoured for the No 7 jersey and Tuipulotu picked as part of an all Scotland 10-12-13 axis, the first time three players from the same country have occupied those positions since 1993. He has picked eight Ireland players to start – Josh van der Flier the most unlucky of his national charges to miss out – but with no Jac Morgan there are no Wales players in the side for the first time since the 19th century.</p><p>The players were presented with their caps by the Lions chair, Ieuan Evans, at a ceremony in Brisbane’s City Botanic Gardens on Thursday night, while the matchday 23 were presented with their jerseys by either family members or a fellow player along with a video message from back home. Farrell urged those selected to make the most of their opportunity.</p><p>“You make sure you don’t have regrets and you don’t get in your own way,” he added. “You don’t want to come off the pitch and think: ‘I wish I had another chance.’ You’ve got to make it happen when it matters.</p><p>“But again, all best laid plans as far as the plan itself or team selection. It’s when you get punched on the nose, that old saying, that you see how people react. But from what I’ve seen so far, their character is certainly a point of difference for this team.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-12\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Marcus Smith has been named on the bench as fly-half and full-back cover with both Blair Kinghorn and Mack Hansen missing out through injury and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/owen-farrell\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Owen Farrell</a> overlooked.

New team owner Mat Ishbia was confident and aggressive. He quickly engineered blockbuster trades for Durant and Beal, who had a combined 16 All-Star appearances at the time. The price for Beal's contract didn't even seem high, because he could dictate his destination due to a rare no-trade clause, and the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"64d73af6-b8ec-e213-87e8-a4eab3a692e7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/wsh/washington-wizards\">Washington Wizards</a> were more concerned with shedding his future salaries than receiving a big score in return.</p><p>But Durant, Beal and incumbent star <a data-player-guid=\"493046d7-fa60-d8a1-1397-b9a6dca8dedf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a> never meshed, and the Suns won a grand total of one playoff series after they started their starry spending spree. That was a first-round victory over the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"083a58a6-b849-3501-e67b-059290d12295\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers\">LA Clippers</a> in 2023, before Beal's arrival. With Beal on the roster, Phoenix never won a playoff <em>game</em>, instead falling in a first-round sweep to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"13f727cb-254d-b484-a337-93fcc0047add\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> in 2024 and missing the playoffs in 2025.</p><p>And now that era is over, all too soon: Durant is a Rocket, and Beal will soon be a Clipper after reaching an agreement on a two-year deal following Wednesday's buyout. Booker is once again the Suns' only star, just as he was in 2020 before the franchise traded for <a data-player-guid=\"63c7648a-60ba-c799-d355-f7f1d43f3a55\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul\">Chris Paul</a> and found a path to the 2021 NBA Finals.</p><p>On the occasion of the breakup, let's remember this ill-fated period, which brought so much hope and bravado but so little tangible on-court success. Here are the four horsemen of the Suns' recent apocalypse:</p><hr><h2>1. Mediocre results</h2><p>The Suns' first problem was availability; the second was mediocrity, even when all three stars were available. Due to various injuries -- mostly to Beal, who hasn't exceeded 53 games in a season since 2020-21 -- the trio shared the floor for just 78 regular-season games and four playoff games across two seasons, going 45-37 in those contests. For reference, a 45-37 record would have placed ninth in the Western Conference last season and 11th the season before, meaning even at full strength, the Suns profiled like a back-end play-in team rather than a top-tier contender.</p><p>Overall, the three-star Suns were 85-79 in the regular season and 0-4 in the playoffs, giving them an 85-83 composite record. They were outscored by 55 points (plus-5 in the regular season, minus-60 in the playoffs); only the Heat were closer to neutral over the past two seasons.</p><p>In other words, the Suns were just about the NBA's most average team with Booker, Durant and Beal all in the fold -- and they were paying for a lot more than just average.</p><hr><h2>2. Superstar incompatibility</h2><p>The NBA's best superstar combos involve players who complement each other's skill sets to produce a whole greater than the sum of their parts. Think about how <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/261/kevin-garnett\">Kevin Garnett</a> protected the paint for <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/662/paul-pierce\">Paul Pierce</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/9/ray-allen\">Ray Allen</a> or how <a data-player-guid=\"5dda51f1-50c9-66e1-2026-400b73f34fad\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Stephen Curry</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"de360720-e416-25f2-8a6b-b5ff82616cb1\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6589/draymond-green\">Draymond Green</a> continually elevate each other in the pick-and-roll.</p><p>The theory behind adding Beal was that he would supercharge the Suns' offense to historic heights when playing with Booker and Durant but also help keep the team afloat when those stars sat. But neither effect proved true in reality, and Phoenix's stars failed to complement each other because their skills overlapped too much, without offering anything new.</p><p>According to PBP Stats, when Booker and Durant played without Beal over the past two regular seasons, the Suns scored 120.5 points per 100 possessions. And when Beal joined that duo, the Suns' offensive rating didn't actually move at all, remaining at 120.5. Beal had no measurable offensive impact when sharing the court with Phoenix's top duo, and the Suns' defense was worse with him on the floor.</p><p>Meanwhile, lineups with Booker alone were better than lineups with Booker and Beal together, and lineups with Durant alone were better than lineups with Durant and Beal together. Lineups with just Beal, and neither Booker nor Durant, scored just 111.5 points per 100 possessions, equivalent to a bottom-10 offense.</p><p>(As an aside, this set of statistics is why I'm skeptical about Beal's fit as a <a data-player-guid=\"4941d040-1812-cbb0-27bf-598cd624bc84\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2595516/norman-powell\">Norman Powell</a> replacement for the Clippers. Can Beal be a difference-maker next to <a data-player-guid=\"35b0f455-b1df-0986-121d-27d2b6c18122\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"87ff907c-c68c-a82d-1215-37e05d0c62ef\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard\">Kawhi Leonard</a> when he evidently wasn't one next to Booker and Durant?)</p><p>Commensurate with his drop in usage rate from 32% across his last three seasons in Washington to 22% in Phoenix, Beal's surface stats as a Sun actually look fine. He scored 17.6 points per game on solid efficiency, making 41% of his 3-pointers.</p><p>But those points proved to be empty calories, with nothing to boost the Suns' standing in an increasingly difficult West. By that measure, he would have been a disappointing addition even if his contract hadn't placed the Suns in the NBA's most compromised financial position.</p><hr><h2>3. Exorbitant spending</h2><p>With Ishbia's eager support, the Suns led the league in total payroll over the previous two seasons. According to an analysis of Spotrac data, Phoenix spent $626 million between salaries and luxury tax payments. That was $51 million ahead of the second-place <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a>. And that doesn't even factor in the nonfinancial penalties that Phoenix faced, due to the league's new cap environment, as a result of spending past the second apron.</p><p>Even more remarkable is the lack of success all that money bought. Every other team in the top 11 in spending over the past two campaigns won at least one playoff game during that span -- but not the Suns. Phoenix nearly <em>doubled</em> the spending of the next team that didn't win a playoff game; the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"9461f397-7882-94c0-c18c-e89bdc9e570e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans\">New Orleans Pelicans</a> spent $336 million, or $290 million less than Phoenix.</p><p>Most of the league's highest-spending teams got some bang for their buck, which makes sense, as more investment in a roster generally leads to more wins and losing teams aren't incentivized to keep going deeper into the luxury tax. But on this graph, which shows spending over the prior two seasons by teams that won or didn't win playoff games in that span, Phoenix stands out.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0716/r1520004_1182x665_16-9.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><hr><h2>4.

Those three players collectively fetched seven additional first-round picks plus a swap when their new teams traded them.</p><p>Add up all those assets and the Suns effectively valued Durant and Beal at the price of 12 first-round picks and six swaps. They don't control any of their own first-round picks until 2032. (That math might be a tad inflated because it's unlikely that, say, Bridges was worth five first-round picks on his own in 2023, though the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"61719eb2-11c3-4e3d-90c3-0a1319fd850b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks</a> were willing to pay that price a year later.

Regardless, the overall cost for Durant and Beal is mind-boggling.)</p><p>\"We do those things a 100 out of a 100 times, not 99 out of a 100, a 100 out of a 100,\" <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40066112/mat-ishbia-says-phoenix-suns-great-position-declines-address-frank-vogel-status\">Ishbia told ESPN's Baxter Holmes last year</a>. \"And we still do 'em again. And I think [the] other 29 GMs would all do the exact same thing.\"</p><p>When they moved on from Durant and Beal this summer, though, all the Suns got in return was one first-round pick (which they used on center <a data-player-guid=\"2cf33fe2-4a92-3188-9d87-78ac5aac53be\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5203685/khaman-maluach\">Khaman Maluach</a> at No. 10), <a data-player-guid=\"e9d2d871-df56-3068-8d5f-e3fc27f49a96\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4437244/jalen-green\">Jalen Green</a>, <a data-player-guid=\"653c07b5-8537-14ac-f4c6-b4e37919aca0\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3155526/dillon-brooks\">Dillon Brooks</a> and a smidge of financial flexibility.</p><p>The result is a team with little present-day talent beyond Booker, almost no future assets and the wreckage of its recent past filling up the rearview mirror.</p><p>Just three years ago, the Suns had a 2-0 lead in the Finals, only two wins away from the first title in franchise history.</p><p>Now, they might have the worst long-term outlook in the league.</p>\n</div></div>"

This allowed them to win the division title via tiebreaker and head to the postseason. The playoffs brought about a dominant win over the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Vikings</a> and a close loss to an <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Eagles</a> team than went on to win their next two games by 50 points en route to a title.</p><p>The division shouldn't get any easier in 2025 with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">49ers</a> unlikely to suffer the same run of bad luck they endured last year, but the Rams may still be best positioned to win the division title once again thanks in part to the emergence of an elite defensive core built in the last two drafts, with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3138203/jared-verse/\">Jared Verse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2964525/braden-fiske/\">Braden Fiske</a> coming aboard in the first two rounds last year and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2864982/kobie-turner/\">Kobie Turner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123718/byron-young/\">Byron Young</a> in the third round the year prior. The group really gelled down the stretch as the Rams held four of their last six opponents -- including playoffs -- to nine points or less, and with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2925442/poona-ford/\">Poona Ford</a> joining the unit, big things may be in store for 2025.</p><p>The highest profile change for the Rams comes at receiver, where <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2006951/cooper-kupp/\">Cooper Kupp</a>, 32, is gone after scoring 58 touchdowns and racking up 7,776 yards on 634 receptions over eight seasons. In his place is another 32-year-old who has been one of the best receivers of the last decade in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1893167/davante-adams/\">Davante Adams</a>, who has scored 103 touchdowns and racked up 11,844 yards on 957 receptions in his 11-year career. Adams just delivered his fifth straight year with at least 1,000 yards and eight touchdowns despite being traded during the season, while Kupp hasn't reached either of those numbers since his Offensive Player of the Year campaign in 2021, so the potential upgrade could do wonders for elevating the Rams offense into a threat to be reckoned with in a tough division and hopefully throughout the playoffs.</p><p>We're going to take a quick look at the Rams' 2024 season and the rest of their offseason moves before getting into their track record in <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> futures over the last five years.

Adams has remained productive despite playing in bad situations in Las Vegas and New York, and now he gets to connect with Matthew Stafford as a complementary weapon to No. 1 receiver <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a>. Shelton's game has steadily improved to the point he was graded 12th in the league by PFF last season at the center position.</p><p>The defense has a chance to make a leap after finishing just 17th in scoring last year. After a stretch where they allowed 37 to the Eagles and 42 to the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Bills</a> in a three-week span, the defense surrendered a total of 24 points over the next three weeks to the 49ers, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Cardinals</a>, then held the Vikings to nine points in the wild-card round a few weeks later. Most notably, the Rams set a record with 16 sacks in a two-week span in the playoffs, and that pass rush could give the team an edge in a stacked NFC West.</p><h2>Reasons to fade the Rams</h2><p>Left tackle <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2251099/alaric-jackson/\">Alaric Jackson</a> is a crucial part of the offensive line, but there's no clear picture of when he'll be able to play while he manages blood clots in his leg. The backup plan at left tackle is D.J. Humphries, who the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Chiefs</a> turned to briefly last season while dealing with tackle issues before moving <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1850818/joe-thuney/\">Joe Thuney</a> to left tackle instead. If Humphries isn't able to handle filling in again this year, it creates a huge weakness on the Rams offense that could limit its effectiveness.</p><p>While the Rams will get to play the NFC South and AFC South like all the other teams in their division, their first-place schedule means they also have the Eagles, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> on the docket, three matchups that could make the difference in the NFC West race. The Rams have the Eagles and Ravens matchups in the first six weeks along with meetings with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> and 49ers, so Jackson's absence would be an even bigger deal in the early part of the season as a 2-4 start could leave Los Angeles needing to sweep the Cardinals and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a> later in the season to get to 10 wins.</p><h2>How to bet the Rams in 2025</h2><ul><li><strong>Win NFC West +195 (DraftKings)</strong></li><li><strong>Matthew Stafford Under 23.5 passing TDs -110 (BetMGM)</strong></li></ul><p>My pick to win the division is going to be the 49ers thanks largely to the difference in non-common opponents between them and the Rams, but it's a close call and I see value taking the Rams at the DraftKings price of +195. I'm comfortable playing them or the 49ers down to +175, and I'd prefer to take on the risk in a divisional bet rather than lay heavy juice on the Rams getting to 10 wins just in case the Alaric Jackson injury and tough early schedule ends up being enough to sink them. This could be a season where the Rams win six games, 12 games or anything in between.</p><p>If Stafford's protection is an issue, there's also less of a chance that he's able to play all 17 games, which he hasn't done since 2021 while topping out at 24 passing TDs over the last three years. While the addition of Adams would theoretically boost his touchdown potential, offseason departures Cooper Kupp and Demarcus Robinson combined to catch 13 of the team's 22 passing touchdowns last year. Even if Stafford stays healthy, there's a solid chance of him falling short of 24 touchdowns.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

The 6-foot-3, 242-pound dual-threat quarterback can not only beat defenses with his powerful arm (2,534 passing yards and 18 touchdowns to seven interceptions as a 19-year-old redshirt freshman) but also with his legs (674 rushing yards and seven touchdowns).</p><p>Sellers showed drastic improvement as a first-year starter, helping the Gamecocks win six of their final seven games last season. His 65.6% completion percentage was also encouraging considering his inexperience and points to further improvement in 2025.</p><p>He sometimes throws passes that are too hot to handle and holds the ball too long in the pocket -- his 3.06-second average time to throw was the 11th slowest nationally in 2024. He'll also need to improve his ball security, as he fumbled 11 times (lost six) last season. But if Sellers can fine-tune these things and continue his growth, he has the tools to be the top pick in the 2026 draft.</p><hr><h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/228.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></h2><h2><a data-player-guid=\"7f0d3ee7-3e4f-3f5b-bd7a-1367c9e1869d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4685413/cade-klubnik\" target=\"_new\">Cade Klubnik</a>, QB, Clemson</h2><p><b>Predicted chance of going No. 1:</b> 15%</p><p><b>Why he could be the top pick:</b> I had Klubnik as the No. 1 pick in my <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2026/story/_/id/44925346/2026-nfl-mock-draft-early-first-round-predictions-quarterbacks-trades-32-picks\">Way-too-Early mock draft</a> in May and feel he can take advantage of arguably the most talented roster in the country. He wasn't on many draft radars after a disappointing sophomore season in 2023, but Klubnik made a major leap as a junior, finishing with 3,639 passing yards, 36 touchdowns and only six interceptions.

There is debate about his arm strength among NFL evaluators, though.</p><p>\"I think he has enough to be a fine starter on the next level, but his setup will always have to be near perfect to get the best out of him,\" an AFC executive from a QB-needy team said this summer.</p><p>Klubnik is set up to make another leap, as Clemson returns its top three receivers (<a data-player-guid=\"6ee3c6a0-e5a8-3675-a87b-2fde56e8b433\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5081432/antonio-williams\" target=\"_new\">Antonio Williams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5112674/bryant-wesco-jr\">Bryant Wesco Jr</a>. and <a data-player-guid=\"f2e4a348-c6b5-3fbc-861c-52ef35c24296\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5218753/tj-moore\" target=\"_new\">T.J.

Games against Oregon (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401752854/oregon-penn-state\">Sept. 27</a>) and Ohio State (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401752889/penn-state-ohio-state\">Nov. 1</a>) are paramount. If he can play more like he did against Oregon in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401673464/penn-state-oregon\">Big Ten championship game</a> last season (280 combined yards and four touchdowns) and less like he did against Notre Dame in the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401677189/notre-dame-penn-state\">CFP semifinals</a> (12-for-23, 135 yards and a backbreaking late interception), Allar could be a top-10 pick ... or higher.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/99.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2><a data-player-guid=\"c3970aed-2e7b-34e0-bf3e-04af89ce8add\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4567747/garrett-nussmeier\" target=\"_new\">Garrett Nussmeier</a>, QB, LSU</h2><p><b>Predicted chance of going No. 1:</b> 15%</p><p><b>Why he could be the top pick:</b> Nussmeier performed well last season in succeeding 2023 Heisman Trophy winner <a data-player-guid=\"f03f3238-b035-6f0e-5844-1529ca021c3a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426348/jayden-daniels\" target=\"_new\">Jayden Daniels</a>, throwing for 4,052 yards and 29 touchdowns to 12 interceptions. Nussmeier is a fearless passer who produces highlights with his uncanny ability to see big plays and throw his receivers open.</p><p>The 6-2, 200-pounder's arm is more flexible than powerful, but his great pocket vision and anticipation on throws to intermediate and deep areas of the fields stand out. He doesn't take many sacks (his 2.9% sack percentage was 12th lowest in the FBS), but can be reckless and put the ball in harm's way -- especially after breaking the pocket. This showed against ranked teams, as he had three games of two or more interceptions against those opponents.</p><p>While Nussmeier's aggressiveness can work against him, he has the smarts, accuracy and anticipation to be a top pick in the draft. Scouts will want to see more consistency and how he adjusts to a new set of receivers out of the transfer portal. He'll be tested right away against Clemson in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401752671/lsu-clemson\">Week 1</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Potential risers</h2><h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/84.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></h2><h2><a data-player-guid=\"2d69f2b3-fc07-332b-bd84-8793a3a1b74a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4837248/fernando-mendoza\" target=\"_new\">Fernando Mendoza</a>, QB, Indiana</h2><p><b>Predicted chance of going No. 1:</b> 12%</p><p><b>Why he could be the top pick:</b> Mendoza <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/43141524/sources-cal-transfer-qb-fernando-mendoza-commits-indiana\">transferred</a> from Cal to Indiana, where he enters a quarterback-friendly offense. <a data-player-guid=\"90eff2c3-0547-4ce3-bfc4-41777479b5c8\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430431/kurtis-rourke\" target=\"_new\">Kurtis Rourke</a> transitioned from the MAC to Curt Cignetti's offense and was drafted in the seventh round of this past draft.

He can stand and deliver in the pocket with ease and is extremely accurate -- his 5.1% off-target percentage last season was the best in the FBS. He also excelled throwing outside of the pocket, with a 91.1 QBR. Sometimes he'll break the pocket prematurely instead of allowing concepts to fully develop, so scouts would like to see him be more patient in those situations.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/228.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2><a data-player-guid=\"f3015a9e-a6d3-393e-bd31-aa0ddd6af7b4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4870886/tj-parker\" target=\"_new\">T.J. Parker</a>, Edge, Clemson</h2><p><b>Predicted chance of going No. 1:</b> 10%</p><p><b>Why he could be the top pick:</b> While quarterbacks are most often selected with the No. 1 overall pick, edge rushers grab the top spot occasionally. <a data-player-guid=\"5431a37e-7b11-f9fb-a12b-68627e0eb858\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426349/travon-walker\" target=\"_new\">Travon Walker</a> was the most recent example in 2022. The 6-3, 265-pound Parker is the most likely non-quarterback to be selected first, combining a good first step with strong hands to disengage at the point of attack.</p><p>Those hands help him win by overpowering blockers, and he finished his sophomore season with 11 sacks and 16.5 tackles for loss, second-most in the FBS among defensive linemen. He has also been a turnover creator, forcing four fumbles last season (also second in the FBS) and stands out in a loaded Clemson defensive front.</p><p>\"I know [defensive tackle Peter] Woods gets a lot of the love, but Parker is the one that could be drafted first off of that defense this year,\" an AFC assistant told me this summer.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/251.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\"></p><h2><a data-player-guid=\"d499f837-dace-3ada-8168-eaaa41b706e3\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4870906/arch-manning\" target=\"_new\">Arch Manning</a>, QB, Texas</h2><p><b>Predicted chance of going No. 1:</b> 5%</p><p><b>Why he could be the top pick:</b> There's a lot of projection here, as Manning has only two starts and 95 passing attempts in his college career. Because of that, I don't believe Manning will be in the 2026 draft. But he has traits that could make him an intriguing option atop the draft if he has a big season.</p><p>The glimpses we saw last season were promising, as he threw for 939 yards, nine touchdowns and two interceptions while rushing for 106 yards and four scores. At 6-4, 222 pounds, Manning has the frame scouts covet and uses it effectively. He has a picture-perfect base and smooth delivery, and his dual-threat capability forces defenses to account for his running.</p><p>There is plenty for Manning to work on. He must become better at progressing past his first read, as his tendency to stick to it leads to bad decisions and forced throws. He also needs to use his mobility more and be more willing to scramble on dropbacks. That's why I expect him to stick with Texas coach Steve Sarkisian, one of the best quarterback developers in the nation, and not rush to the NFL.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><h2>Long shots</h2><h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/redesign/assets/img/icons/ESPN-icon-football-college.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"31\"></h2><h2>The 'out-of-nowhere' quarterback</h2><p>Since <a data-player-guid=\"e6957db5-5b2e-a82d-c788-d889115d9772\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\" target=\"_new\">Joe Burrow</a>'s magical 2019 season catapulted him to the top in the 2020 draft, it has been common for under-the-radar quarterbacks to shoot up draft boards high into Round 1.

He had only three sacks last season as a sophomore, but his explosive power allowed him to penetrate the backfield as a pass rusher.

Even though World didn't allow a sack last season, he drew eight penalties (five for holding, three for unsportsmanlike conduct).

However, the Buckeyes must replace eight starters on defense, including team leaders like Jack Sawyer and JT Tuimoloau.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Smith is the most dynamic player in the country, but like many top contenders this season, Ohio State will be breaking in a new quarterback. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29391740/julian-sayin/\">Julian Sayin</a> takes over for Will Howard. There is no denying Sayin's talent, although Howard's experience and leadership in big games will be missed. The Buckeyes must also replace three starting offensive linemen, their top two running backs and receiver Emeka Egbuka.&nbsp;</p><p>I think Ohio State is one of the toughest teams to judge heading into the season. It still has elite talent at every position, but it's hard for any team in a major conference to lose so many important players and be just as good. It won't take long to get a read on this year's Ohio State team. The Buckeyes host <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> in their opener on Aug. 30.</p><p>I think Ohio State is a bit overvalued entering the year. I make Penn State the favorite to win the Big Ten, so I would pass on the Buckeyes at +190. I also took Texas +3 in the opener because I made the Longhorns slight favorites in that matchup.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Penn State Nittany Lions (+230)</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Is this finally the year James Franklin and Penn State get over the hump? It better be. The Nittany Lions return 14 starters and have the most experienced quarterback in the Big Ten. With Ohio State and Oregon replacing so much production from last season, it feels like the time is now for the Nittany Lions.&nbsp;</p><p>It feels like <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876938/drew-allar/\">Drew Allar</a> has been playing college football since 1988. Now a senior, Allar needs to cut down on mistakes in big games. It says something that I bet <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> in the CFP last year and when Penn State got the ball back late down 27-24, I said to my son, \"Here comes the Allar interception.\" That was followed seconds later by an Allar interception. &nbsp;</p><p>Allar doesn't need to be a world beater, he just needs to play a little better against top competition. That won't be as easy without tight end Tyler Warren, who caught a program record 104 passes last season. To put that in perspective, all of Penn State's other receivers combined to catch 102 balls.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Franklin hit the transfer portal to upgrade the receiver position and the 1-2 punch of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876754/nicholas-singleton/\">Nicholas Singleton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875485/kaytron-allen/\">Kaytron Allen</a> return at running back. I think the offense will actually be more explosive this season, even with the loss of Warren. Receiver was a weakness last year, and I expect transfers <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26720252/kyron-hudson/\">Kyron Hudson</a> (USC), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3168420/trebor-pena/\">Trebor Pena</a> (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CUSE/syracuse-orange/\">Syracuse</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26703014/devonte-ross/\">Devonte Ross</a> (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TROY/troy-trojans/\">Troy</a>) to make the group more productive.&nbsp;</p><p>The defense has lost star Abdul Carter, although there is still enough talent at every level for new defensive coordinator Jim Knowles to work his magic. Overall, Penn State might have the fewest holes of any title contender entering the season.&nbsp;</p><p>The Nittany Lions host Oregon and travel to Ohio State, but the schedule is manageable. Penn State ranks No. 2 in my preseason power rankings behind Texas, and the Nittany Lions are serious contenders to produce the Big Ten's third straight National Champion.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p><strong>Oregon Ducks (+330)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Like Ohio State, Oregon must replace a lot of key contributors from last year's team that entered the College Football Playoff as the No. 1 seed. Don't cry for Dan Lanning just yet, though. No coach in college football does a better job of working the transfer portal and replenishing talent than Lanning.</p><p>The last two seasons, Oregon had the luxury of starting highly experienced quarterbacks in Bo Nix and Dillon Gabriel. That won't be the case this year when sophomore <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a> takes over. Moore started a handful of games for UCLA in 2023 but was inconsistent with 11 touchdowns and nine interceptions.&nbsp;</p><p>Moore will have a lot more talent around him at Oregon and he is always a threat to create plays with his legs. Another advantage Moore has is Oregon will be big favorites in its first four games. That should give all the new pieces on offense time to gel before heading to Penn State on Sept. 27.</p>\n        \n\n<p>While the Ducks' ceiling may not be as high as last season, the schedule really plays into their favor. Outside of the trip to Penn State, Oregon could be favored in the rest of its games. The Ducks avoid Ohio State, Michigan and Illinois, while road games against Northwestern, Iowa, Rutgers and Washington are all winnable.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a strong chance Oregon finishes the season with no more than two losses. If one of those defeats comes on the road at highly-ranked Penn State, the Ducks will be in good position to grab a playoff spot.&nbsp;</p><h3>Overvalued</h3><p><strong>Michigan Wolverines (+1000)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Michigan went through a transition year last season after losing head coach Jim Harbaugh and most of the key contributors from the National Championship team to the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Sherrone Moore is in a much better position heading into his second season. Moore signed the nation's top quarterback recruit in <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28906638/bryce-underwood/\">Bryce Underwood</a> and Michigan's defense will once again be a strength after closing last year holding Ohio State and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> to a combined 23 points.&nbsp;</p><p>My issue with the Wolverines is I think they are a year away from being a serious Big Ten contender again. The quarterback position was a disaster last season and that will be much-improved with Underwood and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FRESNO/fresno-state-bulldogs/\">Fresno State</a> transfer <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701063/mikey-keene/\">Mikey Keene</a>. However, +1000 odds to win the Big Ten are too short for Michigan when teams like Illinois are sitting at +4100. I make the Wolverines closer to +1600 to win the conference.&nbsp;</p><h3>Undervalued</h3><p><strong>Illinois Fighting Illini (+4100)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Speaking of the Fighting Illini, I am really high on them this year. Illinois returns 17 starters from last season's 10-win team and has the most favorable schedule in the conference. The Fighting Illini avoid top contenders Penn State, Oregon and Michigan, while getting Ohio State at home on Oct. 11.</p>\n        \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701853/luke-altmyer/\">Luke Altmyer</a> is one of the Big Ten's top quarterbacks and the defense has playmakers at all three levels. This is Bret Bielema's deepest, most talented team at Illinois with 48 lettermen returning. When you combine talent, experience and schedule, the Fighting Illini have a chance to be this year's version of Indiana.</p><p>While +4100 is a good price for Illinois to win the Big Ten, the bet I really like is the Fighting Illini +520 to make the College Football Playoff. If Illinois avoids a bad upset and takes care of business at home, the Illini should be in the playoff discussion at the end of the season.&nbsp;</p><h3>Best bet to win Big Ten</h3><p><strong>Penn State (+230)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As I mentioned above, I make Penn State the favorite to win the Big Ten, so I see a little value on the Nittany Lions at +230. Ohio State and Oregon have more overall talent but both teams are younger and relying on new faces at key positions. Everything lines up for Penn State to win the Big Ten this season and be a top-two seed in the College Football Playoff.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h3>Big Ten win total best bet</h3><p><strong>Indiana Hoosiers Under 8.5 (-140)</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me first state that I don't believe Indiana is a one-year wonder. Curt Cignetti is one of the top coaches in college football and I expect the Hoosiers to be a mainstay at the top of the Big Ten standings.&nbsp;</p><p>However, oddsmakers have caught up to Indiana. After finishing 11-2 both straight up and against the spread last season, bettors now have to pay a premium to back the Hoosiers.&nbsp;</p><p>Cignetti did another good job of using the transfer portal to fill in gaps, including adding quarterback <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a> from Cal to replace the departed Kurtis Rourke. The thing that concerns me with Indiana is the Hoosiers will face a tougher schedule this season with road games versus Iowa, Oregon and Penn State, along with hosting a strong Illinois squad.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>My ceiling for Indiana is nine wins. I believe more has to go right for the Hoosiers to cash Over 8.5 than the Under. This edition of Indiana feels like a solid 8-4 team.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

While some in the audience laughed, others appeared uncomfortable.</p><p>Gillis continued on for 10 minutes, drawing a scattering of boos at one point, with jokes about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Donald Trump</a> and Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>“Donald Trump wants to stage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/05/trump-ufc-white-house-authoritarian-spectacle\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">a UFC fight on the White House lawn</a>. The last time he staged a fight in DC, Mike Pence almost died,” Gillis said.

The Canadian star, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/23/oklahoma-city-thunder-nba-finals\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">won the NBA title</a> with the Oklahoma City Thunder in June, has attracted criticism for drawing fouls during games. He smiled when Gillis said: “SGA is here. Everybody sitting around him is in foul trouble.”</p><p>Gillis also got a good reception for a joke about former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick and his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson. “A bookie is what Bill Belichick reads to his girlfriend before bedtime,” said Gillis of the 73-year-old.</p><p>Before he ended his monologue, a smiling Gillis said, “I see a lot of you don’t like me and that’s OK. That’s it for me. That went about exactly how we all thought it was going to go. I don’t know why this happened.”</p><p>Gilgeous-Alexander and Simone Biles were named as best male and female athletes once the ceremony got under way. Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder to the franchise’s first title in Oklahoma City while also leading the NBA in scoring. “It’s a dream come true and for dreams to come true it takes a village,” he said, thanking his wife, parents, brother and others. “Those names probably don’t mean much but to me they mean everything.”</p><figure id=\"48f86a59-1905-46e0-9806-60c30cce571e\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Simone Biles accepts the best female athlete award at the Espys\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492b5c8f7ed6f8be6e0df90a42e18cb5b5036cc0/0_0_3972_2648/master/3972.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Simone Biles accepts the best female athlete award.</span> Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Biles, an 11-time Olympic medalist, also claimed the night’s first award, best championship performance for her efforts at the Paris Games.

Their first start as a 12-13 combination for the British and Irish Lions was earlier this month against the Waratahs - Jones scored twice and the Lions won.</p><p>And now Huwipulotu go up another level - a Lions Test. This may not have come about had Garry Ringrose not suffered a concussion, effectively taking Bundee Aki's chances of a start with him, but they're the incumbents now and they're going to take a whole lot of shifting if their telepathic club and country understanding can be brought to the biggest stage of all.</p><p>They've arrived here via very different routes and Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend has had a front row seat.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"Jones-the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-again-\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">Jones - the rise and fall and rise again </span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Jones, 31, landed in Scottish rugby with an almighty bang - power, pace, incredible lines of running, an unerring try-scoring record. Ten in his first 14 Tests - three against Australia, four against England. Unstoppable.</p><p>\"When he first came through he would just wriggle out of tackles,\" says Townsend. \"He knew exactly what he needed to do either to get into space or to force that defender to defend him, which opened up the space for someone else.\"</p><p>Everything was easy, until it wasn't. He sailed through 2016-17 and 2017-18. A World Cup beckoned in 2019 in Japan. A Lions tour looked likely in 2021. None of it happened. There were chunks of time when he couldn't even get a start for Glasgow, when he wanted out and when he was \"at peace\" with the end of his international career.</p><p>In the beginning, they called him 'Humble Huw', a wind-up based on his fantastic confidence. Humble ceased to exist along the way. Injuries came for him, a loss of form hit deeply, an absence of self-belief brought him to the brink. \"I'd decided that was it, my international career was over,\" he said.</p><p>His defensive game was ripped apart, he got an unfair reputation of being indifferent, only keen on the big games for Scotland rather than coalface nights with Glasgow.</p><p>The opposite was the case, but that was him now. Branded. He wanted to talk to his Glasgow coach, Dave Rennie, but they never clicked. Jones had no confidence around him - nervous and sweating, he tried to articulate his frustrations but couldn't really get the words out right. He fell into a slump that nobody saw coming. Him, least of all.</p><p>So he missed out on the 2019 World Cup and didn't play for Scotland for close on two years. The comeback was launched in a season with Harlequins, when he started to rebuild.</p><p>\"Those experiences would have hurt,\" says Townsend. \"They've made him into the player he is today. You can react in two ways there. You can not work on the things you know you have to work on to get back to the level you're capable of playing, or you can say it's not for me, or it was the coach's fault, or whatever.</p><p>\"At times like that, you just hope that players do make it. The feedback we were giving him was that he had to do more on the defensive side of it. He had a nine out of 10 attack and he needed to get his defence up to seven or eight out of 10 and he's done that. He's gone beyond it. We see his defence at the same level as his attack now. He's become a complete player.</p><p>\"We've always wanted him to back himself more and get on the ball more because his running lines are world class.</p><p>\"That little short ball that he's been getting so far on the Lions tour when he's played with Sione, that's a lot to do with him being in the right place at the right time for Sione to give him that pass when the defence has made one or two decisions and they've drifted out and he's through the hole. It's almost a total package in attack.</p><p>\"He reminds me of Alan Tait from my time. He was really good at running those lines and scored a lot of tries. It's a different game now, but they're very similar.\"</p><p>Joint second try-scorer with three, third for line breaks and fourth for metres gained, Jones is having a big tour. The biggest examination has yet to come, though.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"Tuipulotu-the-angry-child-turned-calm-leader\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">Tuipulotu - the angry child turned calm leader</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>It was last autumn when Tuipulotu sat down for a chat after a Glasgow game at Scotstoun and met the Lions question head-on. No shadow boxing, no hedging his bets. The 28-year-old was all-in. He wanted a spot on the tour so much it almost hurt. And now here he is, a soon-to-be Test Lion.</p><p>Tuipulotu's story began in Melbourne. The son of an Australian and a Tongan, the grandson of a Scot and an Italian, he speaks emotionally about his family and powerfully about his upbringing.</p><p>\"I was an angry kid,\" he said when asked about his school years. \"Angry at what was happening around me, frustrated because I didn't know what I was going to do with my life. My mentor at school, Mr Windle, an English guy from Newcastle, changed my whole outlook. He saved me getting expelled a couple of times and got through to me. I owe a lot to him. I stopped having a chip on my shoulder.\"</p><p>Tuipulotu is almost incapable of uttering a dull sentence, whether it's about his beloved Scottish granny, Jaqueline Anne Thomson, a woman who helped in part to raise him, or any other issue you want to throw at him.</p><p>He was playing club rugby in Japan when the offer came from Glasgow. His mates told him not to go. \"Glasgow,\" they said \"is the grimmest city in the UK.\" Turns out, it was the place that changed his life.</p><p>\"When he was in Japan he was mainly playing on the wing,\" says Townsend. \"He was powerful, dynamic, creative. If you've got someone, like Sione, who's carrying hard, but also can put a short pass in or a ball out the back, that's dangerous.</p><p>\"When he first came over, he thought he wouldn't be able to do the things that centres do in the northern hemisphere, but he's worked really hard. The personalities of the two of them (Huwipulotu) are a really good mix - the creativity of Sione and the running lines of Huw, that's the reason they've gelled.</p><p>\"They're both really good rugby players, so if it was an unstructured situation they just know how to get that ball into space and work off each other.</p><p>\"The other way they've combined really well is in defence. They're just aware of what the person inside or outside them is going to do.\"</p><p>Tuipulotu has been good on this tour, but you sense there's another level in him, more power, more directness, more influence. He's been saying for the longest time that making trip was the measure of his dreams. The ultimate dream of being a winning Test Lion is now in his gift.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"Russell-completes-historic-Scottish-101213\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">Russell completes historic Scottish 10-12-13</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Finn Russell has been one of the Lions of the tour so far, arguably the Lion. Control, class, leadership - this has been a long time coming but we're most definitely living in Finn Time now.</p><p>A Scottish 10-12-13 in a Lions Test has never been seen before and the trio will trouble Australia because in the blue of their country they have an exceptional record against them.</p><p>When they met was last autumn Tuipulotu scored in a comprehensive Scotland victory. Russell has won four in a row against the Wallabies. Jones has won his past two Tests against them.</p><p>\"The communication between Sione and Finn is impressive. Sione shares the load in terms of what we should be doing on the edge attack,\" adds Townsend. \"If you've got someone of Sione's calibre saying, 'This is the play' then Finn will trust that and it'll allow him to be more instinctive.</p><p>\"So Finn will have another familiar voice outside him that will be telling him, 'I think there's more space out here, or there's kick space there'. He helps Finn see those pictures.</p><p>\"The skill level that Finn brings, it will be hard for defenders to match all three of them up, because Finn's got a very good running game too, if they start to drift towards Sione and Huw.\"</p><p>Speaking from Auckland, where Scotland are preparing to play Samoa, Townsend said he was a proud coach; happy that the work he's seen these guys put in for so many years has paid off.</p><p>If part one was making the tour and part two was making the Test side, the hardest part of all is now upon them.</p></div><section data-component=\"links-block\"><p><h2 type=\"normal\">More on this story</h2></p></section></article></main></div></div>"

Despite winning the last Wafcon, the Glasgow City winger Linda Motlhalo told Moving the Goalposts that, “not a lot has changed, especially in terms of investing in women’s football”.</p><p>The South African domestic league is still not professional, the national team are still in arguments with the South African Football Federation (SAFA) over unpaid match fees. They are still asking for better facilities and logistics and still desperate for a sponsor (even more so now that longstanding backer Sasol has yet to renew its 16-year agreement). The buildup to this Wafcon was as chaotic as ever with players boycotting a training session to demand the money owed to them, and complained about small, shared hotel rooms and being expected to play in scorching temperatures in a north African (and southern European) heatwave at the base in Oujda, 15km from the Algerian border and the hottest of the host venues.</p><p>The chief executive of Safa, Lydia Monyepao, said the weekend before the tournament began that “the disagreement arose because of the payment dates. However, we have since addressed that matter. But it must be clear that this is not to do with the bonuses for Wafcon. This is about match fees for friendly matches.” When approached by Moving the Goalposts the governing body said it would make no further comments on the issue.</p><p>As Motlhalo put it, 10 days into the event, not a lot has changed except that all 12 teams have got on with things amid some grumpiness. A general lack of interest in Morocco, apart from matches involving the hosts, has raised concerns about the seriousness with which women’s football is regarded. So too, has the fact that the games are being played at second-tier stadiums as the main ones are renovated for the men’s Afcon and the 2030 World Cup. Is this Wafcon an afterthought? Given that it was supposed to take place a year ago and another will kick off in nine months’ time, it could be that is how it is regarded for everyone but those involved, who are making what they can of this opportunity.</p><figure id=\"30a59515-f387-48b1-9e3f-9d6d6cd7e1d1\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-1\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53145189ee2fe071c64514d2810669e57fe13f3a/0_0_5000_3338/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53145189ee2fe071c64514d2810669e57fe13f3a/0_0_5000_3338/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53145189ee2fe071c64514d2810669e57fe13f3a/0_0_5000_3338/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53145189ee2fe071c64514d2810669e57fe13f3a/0_0_5000_3338/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53145189ee2fe071c64514d2810669e57fe13f3a/0_0_5000_3338/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53145189ee2fe071c64514d2810669e57fe13f3a/0_0_5000_3338/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"The Mali team are introduced at the Honor Stadium in Oujda\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53145189ee2fe071c64514d2810669e57fe13f3a/0_0_5000_3338/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"297.082\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Empty seats as the Mali team are introduced at the Stade d’Honneur in Oujda.</span> Photograph: Shengolpixs/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Take Ghana, a country that last qualified for the knockouts nine years ago and who are now unveiling a new generation of players. Their Swedish head coach, Kim Björkegren, has said the Black Queens are more talented than his own compatriots but lacking the Scandinavian attention to minor detail which could elevate them to the next level. “Ghana has so much talent. It’s something in the DNA,” he said. “If you can add 5% of the Swedish organisation, we’re going to have a team that is good, not just in Africa, but in the world.”</p><p>Or take the Senegalese striker Nguenar Ndiaye, who plays at French third-division club Bourges Foot 18, and is the joint leading goalscorer after the group stage. Ndiaye, like so many women at this tournament, started off playing with and against boys to the disapproval of her parents and has since had to climb every rung on the ladder to a contract with an overseas club. She embodies the resilience that it takes to succeed and her advice to young hopefuls from a Confederation of African Football interview a few years back has the same relevance today. “Playing football is really difficult, but it’s also very rewarding,” she said. “It’s very holy, and it doesn’t prevent you from living your life as a woman of your time.”</p><p>Ultimately, that is the discussion we still need to have at the Wafcon: how to balance conversations around pure football with the broader social issues facing African female athletes. While the captains at Euro 2025 are wearing the rainbow armband to support LGBTQI+ rights, homosexuality is illegal in 10 of the 12 participating Wafcon nations. While the European players are talking tactics and strategies, the Africans are doing that while looking for ways to get paid. While women’s football in Europe grows exponentially – Uefa’s most recent report records a five-time increase in the last 20 years and over 1.2 million registered players – CAF’s promotional video for this tournament is a call to action to encourage young girls to play.</p><figure id=\"39a1b76e-0b9d-4e1a-b7fa-dd17b7bb1c3e\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a02ae088c6f240523034ffbcea9ff0980887633/0_0_1512_2016/master/1512.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a02ae088c6f240523034ffbcea9ff0980887633/0_0_1512_2016/master/1512.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a02ae088c6f240523034ffbcea9ff0980887633/0_0_1512_2016/master/1512.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a02ae088c6f240523034ffbcea9ff0980887633/0_0_1512_2016/master/1512.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a02ae088c6f240523034ffbcea9ff0980887633/0_0_1512_2016/master/1512.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a02ae088c6f240523034ffbcea9ff0980887633/0_0_1512_2016/master/1512.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"The Morocco v Senegal game in a cafe in Saidia\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a02ae088c6f240523034ffbcea9ff0980887633/0_0_1512_2016/master/1512.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"593.3333333333333\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Plenty of seats free to watch the Morocco v Senegal game in a cafe in Saidia.</span> Photograph: Firdose Moonda</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, while there are big groups of young boys in Moroccan football shirts kicking a ball about late into the night, the girls are absent.

South Africa do not plan these chants. They sing in the bus and in the tunnel before every game, entirely spontaneously. The squad has a repertoire of traditional songs to hand, they don’t know any of the names and on any given day, one of them starts and the rest join in. It’s an instinctive expression of identity and cannot be explained any better than that. It’s only fitting that they are doing it with such gusto here.</p><p>Morocco is a country of music, often performed informally and almost always loudly. On the weekend of the Wafcon final, Oujda will host a raï music festival, celebrating a genre that originates in western Algeria, is rooted in Bedouin traditions and often sung by women.

The Guards ambled to their dugout to prepare for the day’s hostilities with their upriver antagonists, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/saugertiesvbbc?hl=en\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the Brickmakers of Saugerties</a>. They sported bushy beards and ample facial hair, arranged in swooping and swirling mustaches and endless sideburns. Their bulky wooden bats of sundry shapes leaned against the fence. Two fresh balls were unboxed – one for the game and one in case the first got lost – their seams forming a big X. Someone sipped a drink from a large, brown growler.</p><p>A fiddler played the national anthem as the teams lined up along the basepaths. They faced an American flag with 35 stars for all the states in the union arranged in a double circle.</p><p>The year was 2025.</p><p>The Guards and the Brickmakers are part of a growing scene surrounding vintage base ball (the difference in spelling is deliberate). This retro-version of baseball is a national game and about a quarter century old, but mushrooming in New York’s Hudson Valley, where five teams have sprung up in recent years with more in the works. They play by the rules that governed the sport in 1864, in the thick of the US Civil War.</p><p>Why 1864? Because that was the final year in which balls caught on one hop counted as outs. Before players wore gloves. Or helmets or protective gear of any kind. When the pitching was underhand. When a walk moved up <em>every </em>base runner. Before strikeouts and walks were common and almost every batter put the ball in play. Back when the ball was softer – and only softened further as the game wore on, incentivizing teams to score their runs early.</p><p>Dialing back the sport to an embryonic stage in its evolution, a time before ball players walked upright, as it were, is what attracts the participants to vintage base ball. “Things changed and they progressed, and the game continues to change to this day,” says Will Quigley, who works in insurance and captains Brickmakers, which he founded in 2023. “In the early stages, a lot of it didn’t make sense because they were still figuring the game out.”</p><p>Quigley, 43, like most of his teammates and opponents, is a baseball nut and a history buff and has found the overlapping area in that Venn diagram. In a sense, it’s probably unsurprising that baseball should produce this alternate version of itself, winding back the clock, because no sport trades as heavily on nostalgia or its own history.</p><p>Anthony Alteio has participated in Civil War reenactments and plays left-field for the Guards. “History is my thing,” says the 59-year-old auto-adjuster. “I’m a student of history and a fan of baseball. This is just a lot of fun because it combines two things.”</p><p>Others enjoy the lighter side of the game. “This is the intersection of athletics and humor and history and it’s just, honestly, the funniest thing,” says the Brickmakers’ Maria Cardow, a lifelong ballplayer and a cybersecurity executive in New York City by day. “Because there’s no gloves, every single play is a chance for so much disaster to occur. And it just keeps it exciting. It’s also the intersection of people with <em>highly</em> questionable facial hair.”</p><p>After speaking to the Guardian, Cardow bashed the battered ball into the infield grass and ran it out for a base hit, just as the old diesel vintage train screeched back into the wooden platform next to the field.</p><p>Daniel Torres, who is 35 and works in politics, co-founded the Guards with the Ulster County clerk, Taylor Bruck, after happening upon a game during the pandemic. “I got bored of photographing birds, as a lot of us did during the pandemic,” he says. By 2022, the Guards, named for a Civil War regiment from Kingston that fought in the Battle of Gettysburg, were up and running.This weekend, the Guards will participate in a vintage base ball tournament in Gettysburg.</p><p>That’s part of the sport’s appeal as well. It’s historical roleplaying without the script. “You can go to a reenactment and it’s the same wherever you go,” says Torres. “Maybe a line or two will be different, but it’s the same story. You go to Gettysburg, you know what the outcome is going to be, right? What’s nice about vintage base ball is that it is a live performance. It will never be the same. Every show is different, and you can learn while you watch something that is entertaining and you can recognize as well. It’s a cool way to connect the present and the past and there’s no other American sport where you can do that.”</p><p>The Brickmakers’ uniforms were produced by a Civil War reenactment supplier. Quigley’s wife makes the team’s pillbox hats. He makes his own bats with a lathe. Some teams sew their own leather balls. The Guards get their uniforms and gear from one of a small group of specialized vintage base ball equipment suppliers. Everybody wears modern cleats, for safety, but is required to paint them black.</p><p>The Guards and Brickmakers played an engrossing game on a warm afternoon in late June. There were no bruised fingers or bones this time around, as there often are, owing to the absence of gloves. But the Guards’ catcher, otherwise totally exposed, wore a mouth guard in an allowance to modern dental aesthetics.</p><p>Torres occasionally walked out to the crowd of a few dozen sitting in folding chairs along the third-base line to explain the rules. They could also read up on them in the gameday program the Guards produced, replete with faux old-timey advertising.</p><p>The play was messy but packed with action, contested by men and women – 19th century base ball was coed, after all – and players as young as 15 and pushing well into retirement age. Skill ran the gamut as well. “We’ve got some people who were very competitive high school or collegiate players,” says Torres, “and we’ve got people who are historians, and we’ve got some people who think it’s fun to wear a costume.”</p><p>The trick to vintage base ball, as it turns out, is to avoid hitting balls in the air because the one-hop out makes them deadly. As the game progresses, the ball deteriorates and its flightpath shortens with every passing inning. The Guards kidded each other about $0.05 fines for hitting the ball into the air.</p><p>The home team tied up a close game in the bottom of the ninth inning and again in the 10th, before the Guards won it with a walk-off double in the 11th. The captains each gave an appreciative speech to both teams, stood along the base lines. Then the Guards and Brickmakers traded off a throaty “hip hip hurrah” for the other team, twirling their caps theatrically.</p><ul>\n <li>\n  <p><em>Aidan Lavin contributed reporting.</em></p></li>\n</ul></div></div>"

The way she took the first goal in Sweden's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cwyrxxrlz2xt#MatchStats\">4-1 win over Germany</a> showed a real intelligence to keep onside. It was top-level forward play.</p><p>She has been accused of missing clear-cut chances, but she executed that perfectly. That will have given her a real boost.</p><p>Sweden had 48% possession against Germany, but they showed they could handle pressure because they had weapons on the counter-attack. Blackstenius is a focal point for the team and the one that probably allows Sweden to play more direct when they need to.</p><p>England centre-backs Williamson and Jess Carter need to have good awareness of where Blackstenius is. They need to get it right positionally.</p><p>They need to get tight to her in the box when the ball goes out wide because Blackstenius is really good in the air. Sweden recorded the most open-play crosses during the group stage (61) and they are dangerous in those situations.</p><p>Williamson showed her defensive strengths in the Champions League final. She came up against top-quality forwards and used her pace and reading of the game to intercept passes.</p><p>She is so composed on the ball that she can play her way out of pressure. That is so important for the way England build from the back.</p><p>Carter complements Williamson well because she can distribute off both feet and is very good at using her body to block runs.</p><p>Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton has a role to play in helping England's centre-backs by reducing the space Blackstenius has to run in behind.</p><p>There was a lot of noise around Hampton becoming number one, but her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce9xyep92l8o\">distribution has been excellent</a> so the Sweden defence need to be wary of that. If they push up too high she can play long balls over the top.</p><p>Teams have analysed England and looked at ways they can exploit them, which has often been through those direct passes or outpacing the defence. But there is no way England will not acknowledge Sweden's strengths. They will be prepared.</p></div><div data-component=\"media-block\"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>England thrash Wales to seal quarter-final spot</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"Rytting-Kaneryd-v-Greenwood\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">Rytting Kaneryd v Greenwood</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Sweden might try and press England high up the pitch. If they do that with Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, then England can keep their forwards isolated against the Sweden full-backs and Lauren Hemp can run at them one-v-one.</p><p>England defender Alex Greenwood can put dangerous balls into the right areas with her distribution. The quality of her left foot is so good that she can play it perfectly down the line for Hemp and send her off.</p><p>It is one of the benefits of having Greenwood in the left-back position. There is more balance to England's defence since she moved there.</p><p>Greenwood will be aware of Rytting Kaneryd's dribbling ability. That is one of the Chelsea forward's super-strengths. She likes to carry the ball past players and get in the box. She is also great at crossing the ball from wide areas - 65% of Sweden's chances created from open play came down her right-hand side in the group stages.</p><p>Rytting Kaneryd also has that trademark 'chop' that catches defenders out all the time in the box. Greenwood needs to stay on her feet, and it is better to keep Rytting Kaneryd out wide as she is more dangerous coming inside.</p><p>While England need to be wary of Sweden's wingers, it is the same the other way. Lauren James is just as dangerous to Sweden.</p></div><div data-component=\"media-block\"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Women's Euro 2025 - Best goals of the group stage</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 id=\"The-midfield-battle\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span role=\"text\">The midfield battle</span></h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>It will be interesting to see how Sweden's midfield lines up.</p><p>Hanna Bennison started the win over Germany. She has great technical ability and is so creative. She is probably more attacking, though, so I wonder if Sweden will bring in Julia Zigiotti Olme against England's creative midfield to add more physical presence.</p><p>Zigiotti Olme can keep things ticking but will also put a foot in. She might be able to do both sides of the game better. There is a good blend in Sweden's midfield.</p><p>London City Lionesses midfielder Kosovare Asllani plays in that number 10 role behind Blackstenius and is the link between midfield and attack.</p><p>Asllani is clever with the timing of her movement and has been involved in four of Sweden's eight goals in the tournament. She has good footwork and is a really experienced player. It does not seem like the magnitude of games affects her.</p><p>Filippa Angeldal has really good vision and can recognise when to push up and when to hold back.</p><p>We saw glimpses of what she could do at Manchester City, but she did not get consistent minutes and now it looks like she has had a new lease of life at Real Madrid. She is reinvigorated and playing so well. She understands her role at Sweden and how effective she can be.</p><p>England manager Sarina Wiegman will pick the same midfield three. The balance was lacking against France and they did not recognise the threats. But they have certainly improved on that.</p><p>Georgia Stanway has been putting tackles in and adding more bite, which England needed. Ella Toone has come in and connected well with Alessia Russo and James.</p><p>Keira Walsh has been getting close to the box and putting in shots. Her team-mates even joked that she is chasing the Golden Boot. That is when England are at their best.</p><p><i>Anita Asante was speaking to BBC Sport's Emma Sanders</i>.</p></div><section data-component=\"links-block\"><p><h2 type=\"normal\">More on this story</h2></p><ul role=\"list\"><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div>"

The NHL is taking it outside in Florida, twice actually.</p><p>All hockey is beautiful in some way, but there's no question everyone is looking forward to certain games more than others. There are probably some that we can all agree will be appointment viewing.</p>\n        \n\n<p>We tried to identify those matchups and more in our top 10 most highly anticipated NHL games of 2025-26.</p><h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/STL/st-louis-blues/\">Blues</a> at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/UTA/utah-mammoth/\">Mammoth</a> (April 16)</h2><p>Projecting what might happen at the end of the NHL season in mid-July is a fool's errand. As one of those fools, I feel comfortable forecasting that this game on the final day of the regular season will be for the last playoff spot in the West. Both of these teams are very interesting, and if this does decide the playoff fate of both sides, my eyes will be glued to the screen.</p><h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/NYI/new-york-islanders/\">Islanders</a> at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/WAS/washington-capitals/\">Capitals</a> (Oct. 31)</h2><p>Speaking of projecting, there is a very real chance that Ovechkin will be looking to become the NHL's first 900-goal scorer on Halloween night. The fact that he would have the opportunity to break Wayne Gretzky's record and hit No. 900 against the Islanders again is just a funny quirk.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>8. Stars at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/WPG/winnipeg-jets/\">Jets</a> (Oct. 9)</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/1282456/jonathan-toews/\">Jonathan Toews</a> hasn't played a game since April 13, 2023. That will change on this night when he takes the ice for his hometown Jets. After battling illness for the last two years, Toews will make an NHL comeback and it will be very interesting to see what the 37-year-old three-time Stanley Cup champion looks like in his Winnipeg debut.</p><h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/MON/montreal-canadiens/\">Canadiens</a> at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/TOR/toronto-maple-leafs/\">Maple Leafs</a> (Oct. 8)</h2><p>One day after the NHL's Opening Night, the Canadiens have the chance to go into Toronto and make a statement. Montreal was one of the league's best stories last season, and now it's looking to prove that wasn't a fluke. The Leafs, on the other hand, will be trying to find an identity in a new era.</p><h2>6. Stars at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/COL/colorado-avalanche/\">Avalanche</a> (Oct. 11)</h2><p>Just a few days into the new season, the Avalanche will see <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2178852/mikko-rantanen/\">Mikko Rantanen</a> for the first time since he built their coffin, hammered it shut and threw dirt on their heads in Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs. I plan to watch every game between these rivals in 2025-26, but the first one should be a lot of fun, especially considering it's in Denver.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/EDM/edmonton-oilers/\">Oilers</a> at Panthers (Nov. 22)</h2><p>Yes, we have seen this matchup 13 times in the playoffs over the last two seasons. And, no, I am not tired of it. This championship rematch will be played five days before Thanksgiving, and it will be a feast for all hockey fans. I mean, if recent history has taught us anything, this will be a Stanley Cup Final preview.</p><h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/BOS/boston-bruins/\">Bruins</a> at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-lightning/\">Lightning</a> (Feb. 1)</h2><p>This will not be the first outdoor NHL game in Florida, but it will be the first one played in a stadium featuring a pirate ship with a semi-functional cannon. That counts for a lot in my book. The Lightning get the chance to host their first outdoor game, and it's well-deserved considering they kicked off the state of Florida's run of hockey dominance.</p><h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/NYR/new-york-rangers/\">Rangers</a> at Panthers (Jan. 2)</h2><p>This will be the first time the NHL has taken it outdoors in Florida. The 2026 NHL Winter Classic will be played at LoanDepot Park in Miami, and the defending Stanley Cup champions will take it outside for the first time in franchise history. The Winter Classic has gotten stale for some, but the new locale and the quality of the home team should provide a breath of fresh air. If only they could set up a rink outside the Elbo Room.</p>\n        \n\n<h2>2. Panthers at Bruins (Oct. 21)</h2><p>After leaving the Bruins via trade and winning a Stanley Cup with the Panthers, Brad Marchand will make his triumphant return to Boston. Marchand is a Bruins franchise legend, so this should be an emotional scene at TD Garden. This will be one of the best early-season atmospheres we get.</p><h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/LV/vegas-golden-knights/\">Golden Knights</a> at Maple Leafs (Jan. 23)</h2><p>The last time Mitch Marner was in Toronto, he was booed off the ice by his own fans as the Maple Leafs were eliminated from the playoffs. Now a member of the Golden Knights, it will be very interesting to see what kind of reception he gets at Scotiabank Arena. Regardless of how he's received, Marner can show the Maple Leafs what they're missing.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

The details have yet to be agreed with the players planning to submit a formal proposal later this year.</p><p>Player representatives held two meetings with Wimbledon and French Open officials, and executives from the Australian Open and US Open, at SW19 with sources involved on all sides describing the discussions as positive. The talks had begun in May at Roland Garros, where leading players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/13/living-my-dream-jannik-sinner-wimbledon-redemption-sets-the-stage-for-carlos-alcaraz-rivalry-turning-point\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">including Jannik Sinner</a> and Coco Gauff, met with the grand slam heads and made a series of demands, including a greater proportion of their revenue to be shared in prize money; contributions from the four majors to player healthcare, pensions and maternity pay; and a formal say in decisions regarding tournament scheduling.</p><p>The offer to begin talks over creating a player council for the grand slams is seen as a significant concession by the players, who have always insisted that the dispute is not primarily about prize money. All the grand slams have introduced significant changes to their playing conditions in recent years without consulting the players, including Sunday starts at the Australian and US Opens, playing on the first Sunday at Wimbledon and more evening sessions everywhere, which has led to 3am finishes in Melbourne and Paris in particular.</p><p>Many of the players feel such changes have had a detrimental effect on their preparation for tournaments and want a formal say on such decisions in the future, particularly as there is a feeling some of the grand slams want to introduce Saturday starts to give them three full weekends of action to sell to broadcasters. While the issue of prize money was not discussed in detail at Wimbledon there is an acceptance by the players that it has continued to increase significantly each year, with the All England Club paying out £53.5m this year, a rise of 7% on 12 months ago.</p><p>Wimbledon declined to comment on the details of private conversation, but confirmed discussions had taken place during the championships.</p><p>“We always welcome the opportunity to engage with the players and are regularly in touch with them year-round,” a spokesperson said. “We were happy to continue those conversations at Wimbledon. Listening to the players’ feedback and maintaining a constructive relationship with them is very important to us and these discussions will continue.”</p><figure id=\"a861b023-9272-4115-9c96-aa992f08b50b\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cbd8bcb4029c8ee292577378484cc0b2418dd9/0_0_5335_3557/master/5335.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cbd8bcb4029c8ee292577378484cc0b2418dd9/0_0_5335_3557/master/5335.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cbd8bcb4029c8ee292577378484cc0b2418dd9/0_0_5335_3557/master/5335.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cbd8bcb4029c8ee292577378484cc0b2418dd9/0_0_5335_3557/master/5335.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cbd8bcb4029c8ee292577378484cc0b2418dd9/0_0_5335_3557/master/5335.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cbd8bcb4029c8ee292577378484cc0b2418dd9/0_0_5335_3557/master/5335.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Novak Djokovic\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cbd8bcb4029c8ee292577378484cc0b2418dd9/0_0_5335_3557/master/5335.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.69447047797564\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>The Professional Tennis Players Association, founded by Novak Djokovic, could take legal action against the slams.</span> Photograph: Frey/TPN/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The grand slams are also facing potential legal action from the Professional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Tennis</a> Players Association (PTPA), the international players’ union set up by Novak Djokovic, who filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the ATP Tour, WTA Tour, and International Tennis Federation in March, accusing the sport’s governing bodies of suppressing competition, manipulating prize money and imposing a restrictive ranking system on the players.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-11\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The PTPA filed an amended complaint against the tours in New York last week, which included an addendum that they would hold off naming the grand slams as co-defendants.

After all, he’s supposed to be there.</p><p>And unless you decided to peer particularly closely, you might not even notice that the homeless man in the doorway of the Dolder Grand hotel in Zurich is not a human being at all but a hyper-realistic sculpture called The Traveler, created by an American artist called Duane Hanson in the 1980s and bought by the Dolder Grand hotel in Zurich in the late 2000s as a symbol of … well, what exactly?</p><figure id=\"bbbc4856-4284-4419-bf54-9fd01101112a\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"RichLinkComponent\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"idle\" props=\"{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:2,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;How Sweden became a progressive powerhouse of women’s football | Tom Garry&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;bbbc4856-4284-4419-bf54-9fd01101112a&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/sweden-euro-2025-quarter-finals-england-preview-history-damallsvenskan&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}\"></gu-island></figure><p>We can assume for starters that the juxtaposition is not accidental. So why does a Swiss luxury hotel where rooms cost upwards of £1,000 a night choose to install a sculpture of a homeless man at its front door? An act of subversive arch provocation towards its moneyed guests? A kind of postmodern soul food disguised as an act of subversive arch provocation? Is it supposed to challenge or is it supposed to comfort?</p><p>“Selling rooms alone is not enough today,” says the hotel director Markus Granelli. “We have to entertain people.” But Hanson – who died in 1996 – never regarded himself as an entertainer so much as a truth-teller, a faithful chronicler of the American working class whose work always had an overtly political dimension. How would he feel about this piece being presented in this setting?</p><p>And – more pertinently, for our purposes – how do England’s footballers feel when they see it? Does it discomfort them, titillate them, gross them out? Where do their ultimate sympathies lie? With the browbeaten outsider? Or with the luxury brand graciously allowing this fibreglass vagrant to shelter in its doorway?</p><p>Perhaps it was quietly telling that thoughts on the England bus back from St Gallen after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/england-wales-womens-euro-2025-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">their 6-1 win over Wales</a> had already begun to turn towards Zurich, where they will play their quarter-final against Sweden on Thursday night. “We were so excited to get back to the hotel,” Lucy Bronze said. “Zurich’s like our little home stadium now. We’ve made it our little Wembley.”</p><figure id=\"9b614d25-1268-4e64-a07e-cb76c5925b1c\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb7b6cd464a0a678771477982f1f067147f8da4/0_0_5184_3298/master/5184.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb7b6cd464a0a678771477982f1f067147f8da4/0_0_5184_3298/master/5184.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb7b6cd464a0a678771477982f1f067147f8da4/0_0_5184_3298/master/5184.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb7b6cd464a0a678771477982f1f067147f8da4/0_0_5184_3298/master/5184.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb7b6cd464a0a678771477982f1f067147f8da4/0_0_5184_3298/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb7b6cd464a0a678771477982f1f067147f8da4/0_0_5184_3298/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Dolder Grand hotel in Zurich.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb7b6cd464a0a678771477982f1f067147f8da4/0_0_5184_3298/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"283.1037808641975\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>England have enjoyed staying at the Dolder Grand hotel in Zurich.</span> Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>England <em>love</em> this place.

They love the way it is a place you can explore and also a place you can escape. The contrast with Terrigal at the 2023 World Cup, a delightful New South Wales coastal resort that also felt a significant distance from anywhere remotely interesting, is manifest.</p><p>Sweden secured their qualification for this European Championship in a playoff in December 2024, by which time most of the plum Swiss resorts had been snapped up. They then lost a coin toss with the Netherlands for first choice of the rest. So they ended up rejecting the Uefa‑approved five-star hotel they were offered and taking rooms in a sports complex near Zug where construction works are still taking place on the exterior. Not luxurious, by any stretch of the imagination. But in many ways the perfect place to gestate the gritty underdog mentality that has brought them to their ninth consecutive knockout stage of a major tournament.</p><figure id=\"395aa27c-0862-48fc-8a97-1559ba0731dd\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement\"><gu-island name=\"GuideAtomWrapper\" priority=\"feature\" deferuntil=\"visible\" props=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;975080cd-07cf-4143-9985-75e56771f10a&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;England v Sweden: past three meetings&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p><b>England 4-0 Sweden, 26 July 2022, Sheffield&amp;nbsp;</b></p><p>\\&quot;One of the best goals you will ever see,\\&quot; the former England defender Stephen Warnock said – and few disagreed.

There is an argument to be made that alongside the United States, Sweden are the most consistent international team on the planet: eight straight quarter-finals in the Euros, eight out of nine group-stage progressions in the World Cup (and the other denied on goal difference), to go with Olympic finals in 2016 and 2021.</p><p>Here they won a group almost as tough as England’s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/sweden-germany-womens-euro-2025-match-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">smashing Germany 4-1</a> in the process. In a way they are a model of tournament consistency and as such the perfect gauge of England’s progress through this tournament: have Sarina Wiegman’s side genuinely improved, or has the quality of their opponents, from France to the Netherlands to Wales, simply got progressively worse?</p><p>One of Wiegman’s great strengths is in not overburdening her players with tactical or technical knowledge, in striking the right balance between work and play. This is particularly germane during the knockout stages, with their subtly different energy, where there is always a balance to be struck between complacency and anxiety. Prepare too little and you send the wrong message. Prepare too much and you send frissons of panic through the squad. Sweden deserve respect, but not to an excessive extent. So how to play it?</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-14\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-14\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Perhaps the perfect clip is Sweden’s second goal against Germany, a goal created by Nathalie Björn’s enterprising run out of defence, drawing opponents towards her and finding Smilla Holmberg, who ultimately scores. But at a crucial moment Björn almost loses the ball to Elisa Senss, retaining possession through a fortuitous deflection. Had she been tackled, Germany would have had a three-on-two break.</p><p>These are the margins at this level.

In so doing Gerhardsson – who will be replaced by Tony Gustavsson after the tournament – helped to shed Sweden’s self-image as a team reliant on physicality and set pieces.</p><p>Which is not to deny the extent to which Sweden can still mix it. Sweden and England are the tournament’s two highest scorers in terms of expected goals, the two most prolific crossers. Sweden have committed the joint-most fouls, while earning the joint-fewest yellow cards. And even if Gerhardsson hates the term “adaptation” because of its defensive connotations, this is a team familiar with their own method, with multiple ways of hurting you.</p><p>Sweden’s reliability has made them a tournament team to be respected. But by the same token England’s unpredictability has made them a tournament team to be feared. In 2022 and again in 2023, they exhibited an expert ability to focus their efforts where they would be most needed, the ability to do just enough to win. There are goals coming from all areas of the pitch. This may just be the worst time to play them.</p><p>And here, perhaps, lies the real meaning of the sculpture in the doorway: a deliberate note of dissonance, an implied challenge to the super-rich. Here we all are, looking at the stars. But we are only ever one misstep from the gutter.</p></div></div>"

Although United were 17 points clear of 18th-placed Leicester, an argument can be made that Amorim’s side were a prolonged Bruno Fernandes injury away from a survival dogfight – at least.</p><p>Fernandes is one more curio of a Ratcliffe project that has already lost a football director (Dan Ashworth) and a manager (Erik ten Hag). The oddity is that the captain has also not gone through the exit door.

In June he said: “I had to wait a while to think about the future. I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on. I spoke with Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it. I spoke to the club, who said they weren’t willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.”</p><p>“If United thought it best to move on” and “Amorim tried to talk me out of it” places the onus on the club not wanting him to depart. There is also a school of thought that despite Fernandes also saying his wife offered no preference either way – leaving the player to decide his future – not uprooting the family was a factor. United might not have cried if Fernandes had swung the other way given the desperately needed windfall that would have swelled the coffers.</p><p>Fernandes is United’s best player, by a distance, so Amorim’s wish (backed by Ratcliffe) can be filed as prudent football sense, but United preparing to fly to Stockholm to face Leeds for Saturday’s pre-season opener having signed only Cunha also blares transfer market dysfunction.</p><p>This has been an issue since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in May 2013. In ordering Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho, Antony and Malacia to keep fit alone, Ratcliffe, Amorim and Ashworth’s successor, Jason Wilcox, flag that all are personae non gratae whom the club are desperate to offload, markedly reducing their market value.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-12\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id=\"f14d1120-3c4c-4c29-b8a6-76bd60e83776\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-3\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828dac77489795058848aaba9ab03b4860df058a/581_1073_7675_4431/master/7675.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828dac77489795058848aaba9ab03b4860df058a/581_1073_7675_4431/master/7675.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828dac77489795058848aaba9ab03b4860df058a/581_1073_7675_4431/master/7675.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828dac77489795058848aaba9ab03b4860df058a/581_1073_7675_4431/master/7675.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828dac77489795058848aaba9ab03b4860df058a/581_1073_7675_4431/master/7675.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828dac77489795058848aaba9ab03b4860df058a/581_1073_7675_4431/master/7675.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Bruno Fernandes in training\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828dac77489795058848aaba9ab03b4860df058a/581_1073_7675_4431/master/7675.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"256.9114006514658\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Bruno Fernandes was Manchester United’s best player last season but almost left for Saudi Arabia this summer, which would have been a useful £100m fee for the club.</span> Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>When you possibly need to raise a few more million to land Mbeumo, trumpeting to the industry that five assets can be bought for a bargain is hardly a 4D-chess move.</p><p>For Mbeumo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/manchester-united-bryan-mbeumo-stalls-brentford-raise-price-70m\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Brentford now want a total of nearer £70m</a>, up from the £65m Ratcliffe and company understood last month would have had him joining Cunha in Amorim’s squad. Ratcliffe is determined not to be pushed into paying over the odds so plays the patience game.</p><p>But as the clock ticks you wonder how Amorim feels about the effect on preparation for the campaign. United have no European football for the first time since 2014-15, meaning the head coach will have more days to drill his team in his beloved 3-4-3. But, as he constantly says, the right players are needed to fit this.</p><p>After Delap, the number-one centre-forward target, plumped for Chelsea – he is now a world champion – Amorim remains hopeful of signing a No 9. But given United’s position in the market you could forgive the Portuguese being unsure whether Ratcliffe-Wilcox can pull off a deal – or seal Mbeumo’s arrival. To further complicate matters, the goalkeeper André Onana will not be able to play on the US pre-season tour, and perhaps for longer, because of a hamstring injury.</p><p>Eriksen also said: “Next season it has to be better and I’m sure it will be.” Ratcliffe and his cohort have to show there is a plan B.</p></div></div>"

That means that players like <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2227731/cedric-mullins/\">Cedric Mullins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211177/ryan-ohearn/\">Ryan O'Hearn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29632883/tomoyuki-sugano/\">Tomoyuki Sugano</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044513/zach-eflin/\">Zach Eflin</a>, and Seranthony Domínguez, among others, will probably be elsewhere by the time the calendar flips to August.

Look for them to seek out takers on the likes of Ryan Helsley, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2167502/erick-fedde/\">Erick Fedde</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2107839/steven-matz/\">Steven Matz</a>, and possibly <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2693484/phil-maton/\">Phil Maton</a>. A trade of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1755142/nolan-arenado/\">Nolan Arenado</a> remains a possible deadline outcome, but his full no-trade clause must be taken into account.&nbsp;</p><h2>Obvious sellers&nbsp;</h2><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/311.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/\">Athletics</a>:&nbsp;</strong>The A's were expected by some to be fringe contenders this season, but that didn't come to pass. Indeed, the club right now is on pace to lose 94 games after losing 93 last season. The big question is whether they'll field offers for right-handed starter <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2117131/luis-severino/\">Luis Severino</a>, who sounds as though he's having buyer's remorse after signing a two-year pact with the A's last winter. He's got an ERA over 5.00, though, and his contract includes a $22 million player option for 2027. The A's will sell, but the extent of it is TBD.&nbsp;</p><div>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHW/chicago-white-sox/\" aria-label=\"home team page\">\n                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/304.svg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    \n    <p><strong>Chicago White Sox:&nbsp;</strong>While they aren't as bad as they were last season when they lost a record 121 games, the Sox are still the worst team in the AL by a comfy margin.

In the South Siders' case, that means gauging the market for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2826875/luis-robert/\">Luis Robert</a> Jr., among other players.

The 2022 NL Cy Young winner is in his comeback season from Tommy John surgery, and the overall results have been very, very ugly.

Soon enough, we'll be in the thick of the preseason, and the 2025 regular season will be here before we know it.

However, there are some moves that went down this offseason that we know will have some sort of impact on the regular season. And that's what we'll be identifying for our exercise today.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we're going to scan through all of the major moves that happened throughout the offseason and rank them on how they may impact the upcoming year. These moves will range from simple player acquisition, players departing one organization for another, key stars being retained, a team choosing to keep one player over another, and coaching hires.&nbsp;</p><h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a> trading <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071515/jalen-ramsey/\">Jalen Ramsey</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2081506/jonnu-smith/\">Jonnu Smith</a></h2>\n<p>Even before trading away Ramsey and Smith to the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, the Miami Dolphins were looked at as a team possibly facing a downturn in 2025. Their win total for the year is hovering around 8.5 and 7.5 with the action juiced to the Under on 8.5, meaning they are expected to be an under .500 club yet again in 2025. This trade only made Miami worse, and it came at a point in the offseason when there were no viable replacements to bring in.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>While the situation with Ramsey devolved to a point of no return, the Dolphins didn't exactly prepare for a departure that most folks saw coming miles away. Ramsey may have had a down year by his standards in 2024, but he still allowed just an 83.2 passer rating when targeted by opposing quarterbacks and broke up 11 passes. In his absence, the Dolphins are currently set to lean on a cornerback room headlined by <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122721/storm-duck/\">Storm Duck</a> (2024 undrafted free agent), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3131626/cam-smith/\">Cam Smith</a> (played six games in 2024 due to injury), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071570/artie-burns/\">Artie Burns</a> (played four games in 2024 due to injury), <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26702648/jason-marshall-jr/\">Jason Marshall Jr</a>. (a fifth-round rookie), and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28867686/kader-kohou/\">Kader Kohou</a> (primarily a nickel corner).&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dolphins seemed to unlock Jonnu Smith midway through last season, and the tight end fit well within Mike McDaniel's offense. Smith led the team in receptions and receiving touchdowns, while logging a career-high 884 yards receiving. Why move on from a player like that? And the replacement is set to be <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1850793/darren-waller/\">Darren Waller</a>, who was <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/darren-waller-trade-grades-dolphins-make-unexpected-gamble-to-replace-jonnu-smith-as-giants-unload-veteran-te/\" target=\"_blank\">retired at this point last year</a></span>? Trading away a No. 1 corner and one of your top pass catchers may only further push Miami down the standings and make the seat under McDaniel tremendously hot.&nbsp;</p><h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">Giants</a> trading up for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a>&nbsp;in the 2025 <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a></h2>\n<p>After selecting pass rusher <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28890311/abdul-carter/\">Abdul Carter</a> with the third overall pick, the New York Giants traded back up into the first round to select Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart. While we shouldn't expect a <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163079/c-j-stroud/\">C.J. Stroud</a> or Jayden Daniel-type rookie season from Dart, his arrival to the Big Apple is primed to shake up the organization in some way, shape or form. The club has been adamant that <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a>, who signed with the Giants in free agency, will be the Week 1 starter. However, it does seem like it'll only be a matter of time before Dart leaps over him. Already during offseason workouts, Dart <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/giants-rookie-qb-jaxson-dart-looks-impressive-working-with-first-and-second-teams-in-minicamp/\" target=\"_blank\">worked with the first and second team offense</a></span>, so he seemed to be vying for playing time earlier than expected.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Dart's eventual ascent could prove to be the last gasp of Wilson's <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> career, which shouldn't be overlooked. On top of that, his success if/when he does line up under center could very well determine the fate of the entire Giants masthead. If Brian Daboll pulls that lever and makes Dart QB1 and it fails, he is as good as fired along with general manager Joe Schoen. If he shows some promise and New York is at least respectable, that could result in both Daboll and Shoen keeping their jobs, and suddenly the Giants have an arrow that's not pointing towards the depths of the NFL.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2025-nfl-head-coach-hot-seat-rankings-these-coaches-must-deliver-successful-seasons-or-risk-getting-fired/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>2025 NFL head coach hot seat rankings: These coaches must deliver successful seasons -- or risk getting fired</p>\n                <p>\n                    Tyler Sullivan                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 NFL head coach hot seat rankings: These coaches must deliver successful seasons -- or risk getting fired\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/06/26/bf98373e-0c4b-4a26-bb00-49da1fa91243/thumbnail/270x152/270902205f147f8ed7dc899c27e0f773/brian-daboll.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> re-signing <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2005667/ronnie-stanley/\">Ronnie Stanley</a>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>It cannot be overstated how important it was for the Baltimore Ravens to retain Ronnie Stanley. He was unquestionably the top left tackle on the market, and it appeared for a minute that he'd depart Baltimore for the highest bidder. Instead, he decided to ink a three-year, $60 million contract just a day before the legal tampering window opened. By keeping Stanley in-house, the Ravens solidified that <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> will continue to have elite protection on the blindside. And for a team that is in the thick of its <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> window, it's a monumental signing.&nbsp;</p><p>Had he decided to truly enter the market and leave, there wasn't much out there in free agency for Baltimore to replace him with. The next-best tackle was arguably <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2871346/dan-moore-jr/\">Dan Moore Jr.</a>, who gave up 12 sacks with the Pittsburgh Steelers last season. If they opted to find his replacement at the <a href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a>, that brings its own set of question marks. Keeping Jackson upright is the most important thing for Baltimore's Super Bowl hopes, and keeping Stanley helps do just that.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">Patriots</a> hiring Mike Vrabel as head coach</h2><p>New England has endured what Robert Kraft called <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/robert-kraft-vows-turnaround-for-patriots-what-needs-to-happen-to-consider-2025-a-success-for-new-england/\" target=\"_blank\">\"the worst\"</a></span> two-year run of his ownership tenure, as the Patriots have gone 4-13 in each of the previous two seasons. However, there is promise for the organization to turn things around in 2025. The club addressed key needs along the roster in both free agency and at the NFL Draft, and seems to have found its building block at quarterback with rising sophomore <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695757/drake-maye/\">Drake Maye</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While all of that certainly will make New England a more talented outfit, the hiring of Mike Vrabel should be looked at as the biggest move of the franchise's offseason. His presence on the sideline and proven in-game coaching ability (something that was sorely lacking throughout last season) raise the floor of what the Patriots may be in 2025. On the betting markets, they are -235 to go over their 7.5 win total and are also favored to go over 8.5 at -120. If they do, that's more than doubling their win total from a season ago and, if they reach nine wins, it's more than they've had in the prior two years combined. Certainly, a piece of that optimism is due to the arrival of more talented players, but a chunk of it also belongs to stability at the head coach position in Vrabel.&nbsp;</p><h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seahawks</a> trading <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a>, signing <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180320/sam-darnold/\">Sam Darnold</a></h2>\n<p>This game of quarterback musical chairs impacts three different organizations: the Seattle Seahawks, Las Vegas Raiders and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a>. First, Minnesota decided against retaining Darnold and opted to enter this coming season with former first-round pick <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26695214/j-j-mccarthy/\">J.J. McCarthy</a>&nbsp;under center. With a return to the Vikings no longer an option for Darnold, he set his sights on the Seahawks, but Seattle first had to trade away starter Geno Smith to the Raiders. All three of these organizations will now have new starting quarterbacks. But how will it all shake out?&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>The Raiders are unquestionably better with Smith as their quarterback as opposed to the combination of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2183083/gardner-minshew/\">Gardner Minshew</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2868716/aidan-oconnell/\">Aidan O'Connell</a> last year. For the Vikings, it makes sense to see what they have in McCarthy after investing a first-round pick in him a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the Seahawks, this is more of a risky endeavor. They certainly got younger with Darnold (28) over Smith (34), but will they get better quarterback play? Darnold turned back into a pumpkin at the tail end of last season with his Vikings unable to score double-digit points in Week 18 against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, nor during their one-and-done playoff appearance against the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>. There's a scenario where Darnold was primarily the beneficiary of an outstanding situation in Minnesota and is primed to regress now that he's surrounded by a lesser cast, resulting in a $100 million miscue by Seattle.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Texans</a> trading <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079900/laremy-tunsil/\">Laremy Tunsil</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a></h2>\n<p>The offensive line was a major issue for the Houston Texans last season. While the unit certainly needed fixing, trading away your best lineman wasn't exactly the way most folks thought they'd address it. The return for the star left tackle was substantial, but C.J. Stroud was sacked 52 times in 2024, and according to Pro Football Focus, Tunsil only accounted for two of those. He was hardly the problem, and if this revamped line struggles -- particularly whoever takes over at blindside tackle -- it could have major ramifications for Stroud taking another step forward in Year 3 and the Texans' overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<p>Conversely, this was a major get for the Washington Commanders, who are coming off an appearance in the NFC Championship Game. They struck gold with <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> and have now given their rising second-year quarterback a bona fide left tackle to protect him, which should only help his development. A team that was in the NFL's final four a season ago got notably better at one of the most important positions in the sport.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/predicting-nfl-all-pros-at-every-offensive-position-what-they-look-like-where-theyre-picked-and-whos-next/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                \n                <p>Predicting NFL All-Pros at every offensive position: What they look like, where they're picked and who's next</p>\n                <p>\n                    Josh Edwards                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n                            \n                                                    \n                \n                        \n                                    \n    <figure><img alt=\"Predicting NFL All-Pros at every offensive position: What they look like, where they're picked and who's next\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/07/15/9fcca88d-1b28-4d7e-ada9-04e7d3ce8f4f/thumbnail/270x152/f65c44fa96840ef6deafa2a696eef354/jayden-daniels.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"152\" width=\"270\"></figure>\n                        \n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>4. Steelers signing <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/419780/aaron-rodgers/\">Aaron Rodgers</a></h2>\n<p>No one moves the needle quite like Aaron Rodgers. He is now set to be the Pittsburgh Steelers starting quarterback after inking a one-year deal with the franchise for what may be his final season in the NFL. If we're talking about impact on the 2025 season, it's hard to argue putting this move any lower. Given where the Steelers were in the offseason at the time of Rodgers finally making his decision to sign, they were on the doorstep of possibly being forced to start <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131167/mason-rudolph/\">Mason Rudolph</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Had that scenario played out, we were looking at Mike Tomlin enduring his first under .500 season and the bottom completely falling out from under the Steelers. With Rodgers in-house, Pittsburgh can no longer be looked at as an easy out on a weekly basis and could prove to be competitive in the AFC playoff picture if the veteran quarterback still has some of his Hall of Fame talent in the tank. The investment in trading for and signing star wideout <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260185/dk-metcalf/\">DK Metcalf</a> earlier this offseason will also now bear fruit with Rodgers throwing him the football as opposed to Rudolph or rookie <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162310/will-howard/\">Will Howard</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> extending <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809208/tee-higgins/\">Tee Higgins</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139298/mike-gesicki/\">Mike Gesicki</a>&nbsp;while not prioritizing defense</h2>\n<p>The Bengals spent big this offseason, retaining some of their key figures on offense. Of course, signing <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966320/jamarr-chase/\">Ja'Marr Chase</a> to his earth-shattering $161 million contract extension was a no-brainer. But the Bengals also extended fellow receiver Tee Higgins to a four-year, $115 million deal and tight end Mike Gesicki to a three-year, $25.5 million contract.&nbsp;</p><p>In a vacuum, those deals are all well and good, as both Higgins and Gesicki have proven to be solid pieces for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a>. That said, keeping those figures in-house appears to have come at the cost of not improving the defensive side of the ball. The Bengals remain embattled in contract disputes with both <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bengals-in-contract-standoff-with-trey-hendrickson-breaking-down-where-things-stand-going-into-training-camp/\" target=\"_blank\">star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson</a></span> and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/back-to-school-back-to-the-draft-shemar-stewart-could-exploit-loophole-in-chaotic-rulebook-to-burn-bengals/\" target=\"_blank\">first-round edge rusher Shemar Stewart</a></span>. Specifically with Hendrickson, if that situation continues to devolve and lead to his departure, a Cincinnati defense that was already poor in 2024 will lose its best player, who just led the NFL with 17.5 sacks.</p><p>Instead of signing Higgins and/or Gesicki, there was a strong case to be made for Cincinnati to use that capital to bolster the defensive side of the ball, even if that meant taking a small step backwards offensively. After all, the Bengals had six losses when the offense scored 25 or more points last season, which tied an NFL record. They also had two losses when scoring 38 or more points (also tied for an NFL record).&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/395994/ben-johnson/\">Ben Johnson</a>&nbsp;and Aaron Glenn both leaving the Lions</h2><p>The Detroit Lions were the No. 1 seed in the NFC last season and will now look to replicate that success and push closer towards a Super Bowl run without their coordinators. Both Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn left the organization this offseason after being hired as head coaches by the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Chicago Bears</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>, respectively. While Detroit still has Dan Campbell at the helm as head coach and the vast majority of its core roster intact, their departures are a big variable, as they were each sensational on their respective sides of the ball.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news for the Lions is that in each of the previous four instances where a team retained its head coach but lost both coordinators to head coaching jobs in the same offseason, that club still made the playoffs the following season. While that's encouraging, it remains to be seen if Detroit will be better, the same or worse without Johnson and Glenn. If it's the latter, that'll have major ramifications in the NFC North race and the overall NFC playoff picture.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of the NFC North, Johnson decided to stay in the division with the Bears, who dramatically improved their roster this offseason. If he brings just baseline coaching to the organization, Chicago could be in the playoff hunt. As for Glenn, he takes over a Jets team that boasted one of the better defenses in the NFL, allowing just 5.0 yards per play in 2024 (tied for the second lowest in the NFL). If he can get serviceable play from his new quarterback&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1273205/justin-fields/\">Justin Fields</a>, the Jets might be frisky.&nbsp;</p>\n        \n\n<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1114942/matthew-stafford/\">Matthew Stafford</a> staying in Los Angeles</h2>\n<p>To me, Matthew Stafford staying with the Los Angeles Rams after briefly flirting with a divorce was the most impactful move of the offseason. With Stafford, L.A. is in the Super Bowl conversation thanks to the continued presence of Sean McVay, along with an emerging defense. Without him, the Rams likely would've been forced to look at other options like <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1760229/jimmy-garoppolo/\">Jimmy Garoppolo</a>, Aaron Rodgers, or some draft prospect. Regardless of who would've been under center, Los Angeles would've been categorically worse and nowhere close to the Super Bowl ceiling it currently possesses.</p><p>Down the stretch, Stafford played like an MVP candidate for the Rams, leading them to a 7-2 record over his final nine games (including playoffs) while averaging 7.6 yards per attempt and throwing 15 touchdowns with just one interception. In the postseason, Los Angeles proved to be the only true threat to the eventual champion <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, nearly pulling off a last-second upset in the divisional round. There's no reason to expect him to slow down in 2025 outside of injury, making the Rams a legit threat to win Super Bowl LX.</p>\n\n\n        \n            </div></div>"

number eight and Fraser McReight completing the back row.</p><p>\"The good thing with Nick, he's a good line-out option,\" said Schmidt. \"He is probably a bit more of a roving scavenger than 'Bobby

That's what is on the line this week at the 2025 Open Championship as Royal Portrush hosts the final major of the season in Northern Ireland.</p><p>Returning to the par 71 for the first time since 2019 -- only the third time The Open has ever been held outside of Scotland or England -- the R&amp;A has set up a tournament that will do its best to identify the man most equipped to deal with the elements and emotional toll one experiences across four rounds of major championship golf.</p><p>The first three 2025 majors have featured a little bit of everything. Rory McIlroy endured the longest round of his life Sunday at Augusta National to capture the Masters and complete the career grand slam in a playoff over Justin Rose. Scottie Scheffler surged past a crowded leaderboard that featured Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau for his first major away from the comfy corridors of Augusta National at the PGA Championship. And then, out of nowhere, J.J. Spaun enjoyed the spotlight at Oakmont Country Club as the lone man under par in the most difficult test of the season at the U.S. Open.</p><p>Who will step up this time? Don't miss your favorite golfers kicking off Round 1 with a full slate of <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-british-open-tee-times-pairings-complete-schedule-groupings-in-round-1-on-thursday-at-royal-portrush/\" target=\"_blank\">tee times for Thursday at Royal Portrush</a></span>.</p>\n        \n\n<p>The list of contenders remains relatively the same compared to the first three majors of the season, but new entrants have entered the fold. Staples have stumbled, stars have started to find their way, and surprises seem imminent given the variability that Royal Portrush may present.

While the wand is much improved in 2025, it has been dicey across the pond throughout his career, including last week at the Scottish Open. <em> Odds: 9/2</em></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div>\n                                        \n    \n\n    <div>\n                \n                                                                            \n    \n    \n    \n                        <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/players/554014/rory-mcilroy/\">\n                        <div>\n                                                                                                                        \n        \n    <figure><img alt=\"player headshot\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/04/09/d7bc05db-900c-4fb2-8bb4-e8b37e5b0547/thumbnail/100x100/2b05acb8db388898e2b8909e54d1a44e/554014.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n                                            </div>\n                    </a>\n            \n    </div>\n\n            <div>\n    \n    <p><span>\n                    <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/players/554014/rory-mcilroy/\">\n                Rory McIlroy\n                    </a>\n            </span>\n    \n    \n    \n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">His run in major championships has been uninspiring since the Masters with a T47 at the PGA Championship and T19 at the U.S. Open, but he returns to Royal Portrush rejuvenated and refreshed.

Jasprit Bumrah had been monstering Australia with his new-ball spells across three Tests. Nathan McSweeney had been eaten alive. Konstas was a teenager on debut, on the biggest day of the Australian sporting calendar, on the MCG against the best bowler in the world. He smashed that bowler out of the attack, not just with aggression but audacity, and the energy shift set Australia towards a win. Trying something different made sense. Defence hadn’t worked. The question that remains is how Konstas was the one picked for that job.</p><figure id=\"5a1639dc-6791-4c69-9360-28756e48acdf\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-2\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91c9ee39537b6365086d9c53a352f42c65c27545/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91c9ee39537b6365086d9c53a352f42c65c27545/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91c9ee39537b6365086d9c53a352f42c65c27545/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91c9ee39537b6365086d9c53a352f42c65c27545/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91c9ee39537b6365086d9c53a352f42c65c27545/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91c9ee39537b6365086d9c53a352f42c65c27545/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Sam Konstas is bowled by Shamar Joseph during the first Test match against West Indies in Barbados\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91c9ee39537b6365086d9c53a352f42c65c27545/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Konstas never looked the part during the West Indies series.</span> Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>To that point he was a known talent with grade runs and under-19s hundreds, but before the 2024/25 season his New South Wales career consisted of four Sheffield Shield games, one half century and an average of 25. When he started his second season with twin centuries against South Australia, excitement went through the roof. His next few Shield scores were mid-range but then came a ton for the Prime Minster’s XI. This wasn’t first-class; it wasn’t even List A. It was a 50-over game where India strolled to a win. It wasn’t serious cricket, but the talk escalated again.</p><p>By this stage it was a kind of collective hallucination, amplified between media, fans and administrators, that this kid was the second coming of somebody or other. The sealer, weirdly enough, was a Big Bash game on 17 December, Konstas outshining former Test opener David Warner with a fast 56 in a symbolic handover. On screen for an interview, Konstas was so confident and impressive that a vision drawn in pencil was gone over in ink. The vibes were good. A week later his national debut was confirmed. Essentially, Sam Konstas unknowingly talked his way into the Australian team.</p><figure id=\"b0e6da09-e9f6-4c89-ae21-b2e586ab8d27\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\"

potential, but the next three highlighted his limitations. </span> Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>After Boxing Day, delirium reached its height. There was talk of Konstas revolutionising red-ball batting – never mind that England had batted that way for three years, and Rishabh Pant before them, and Adam Gilchrist before him, and Gilbert Jessop before the first world war. But reality is the hard ground at the end of every parabola, and it rushed up fast. Second hit, Konstas managed one top edge to the fence before Bumrah blew up his stumps. In Sydney he kept hacking for 23 and 22. By the second innings Bumrah was absent injured, giving Konstas the chance to build something against lesser bowling. But he was Red Bull on tap. Unable to calm down, he played the worst shot of his career on 22 off 16 balls, trying to pick up short width from outside off and smear it over mid on.</p><p>Now you had a player confused about what was expected of him and how to do it. The plan to disrupt Bumrah had worked, but domestic cricket has dozens of players with middling records who can play scoops and laps and back-away cut shots.

One was a fixation on Travis Head opening in Asia: having tried this too late to save the 2023 India tour, and with the next trip to India two years away, insisting on doing it in Sri Lanka was an esprit d’escalier selection. Two, if Head had to open, a management that believed in its choices would have sent Usman Khawaja to the bench, backing the player closest to the entrance rather than the exit. It was a wasted chance to give Konstas confidence, as well as running down selectors’ own confidence ahead of the World Test Championship final in London, where they went for Marnus Labuschagne.</p><p>Three Tests, two fill-in openers, and six months of waiting before Konstas next got to play in Barbados in June, the start of his three-match Caribbean misadventure returning 50 runs at 8, leaving Australia with a vacancy ahead of the Ashes. Most of cricket is failure, so streaks are statistically inevitable. Selectors can’t be criticised for the right candidate making low scores, but that’s if they pick the right candidate. In this case they stopped halfway. There was no firm basis for them to pick Konstas at the top level to begin with, but having done so, his only chance of success was to be backed as though there was. He may not have made any runs in Sri Lanka or in London, but at least selectors would have known that sooner. A vote of confidence rather than reticence couldn’t have gone any worse.</p><figure id=\"b59ef22a-f4f7-4769-9047-6f347e9c37f0\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"><div id=\"img-6\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc22cc48b03e44198876931ecc340917706b40e/0_0_5732_3821/master/5732.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc22cc48b03e44198876931ecc340917706b40e/0_0_5732_3821/master/5732.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc22cc48b03e44198876931ecc340917706b40e/0_0_5732_3821/master/5732.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc22cc48b03e44198876931ecc340917706b40e/0_0_5732_3821/master/5732.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc22cc48b03e44198876931ecc340917706b40e/0_0_5732_3821/master/5732.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc22cc48b03e44198876931ecc340917706b40e/0_0_5732_3821/master/5732.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"><img alt=\"Konstas attends a practice session\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc22cc48b03e44198876931ecc340917706b40e/0_0_5732_3821/master/5732.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.640788555478\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"><span><svg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>At 19 years old Konstas may well be back, but something in cricket things just don’t come together in the right way.</span> Photograph: Ishara S Kodikara/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Making the wrong choice about a young player is a risk to their wellbeing. Early elevations can derail them for years to come. Even brief forays that go well can destabilise players who return to state or club. Suddenly everyone is looking at them, either expecting them to play incredibly or gloating when they don’t. They’re left self-conscious, unsure of their ability, unsatisfied with the level they’re playing, so fixated on getting back up the ladder that their game falls into disrepair at the levels below. Success there feels like failure for not happening higher up. Failures are keener still.</p><p>We’ve seen it all before. Todd Murphy had his bowling go to pieces after early Test success in 2023. Kurtis Patterson is just now getting his game back to its best after being dropped six years ago. Matt Renshaw was celebrated as a 20-year-old opener but soon slid away to an unsatisfying career. You’d like to think that Konstas will be back, but it’s not entirely up to him. Things might just never come together in the right way. Support can only do so much. There was a punt and Konstas is left with the debt. In their excitement about the idea that he was their future, this team might not have taken enough care with his own.</p></div></div>"
