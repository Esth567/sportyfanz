The NBA MVP and Finals MVP also came close to an unprecedented financial threshold.</p><p>In 2030-31, the fourth year of Gilgeous-Alexander's new deal, he is projected to earn $79 million. That amounts to more than $963,000 per game -- putting him close to the NBA's first contract worth a million dollars per contest.</p><p>Even if Gilgeous-Alexander won't reach that milestone, the NBA's richest players grow even richer. When former MLB pitcher Nolan Ryan became the first professional athlete to sign a contract that would pay him a million dollars per <em>year</em> in 1979, it was the day's top sports story in The New York Times.</p><p>So let's examine the factors behind the NBA's next financial breakthrough, the top candidates to achieve it and its ripple effects for star salaries and the league writ large.</p><hr><h2>Reasons behind skyrocketing superstar salaries</h2><p>The top of the NBA's salary scale has raced upward because of two key factors: the existence of the supermax extension -- officially the \"designated veteran extension\" -- and a rising salary cap.</p><p>In 2017, the new collective bargaining agreement created the supermax tier of contracts. Now, players who have been in the league for seven to eight years, have been with the same team for the duration of their contract and have met certain awards criteria are eligible to sign extensions that start at 35% of the salary cap. Gilgeous-Alexander became the 14th player to sign such a deal.</p><p>The supermax is extra lucrative because of \"basketball inflation,\" which has increased at a much greater rate than general inflation. A decade ago, the salary cap sat at $63 million, which is about $85 million in today's dollars, given national inflation trends. But the 2024-25 salary cap was $141 million -- a two-thirds increase compared to that expectation.</p><p>These trends have combined to raise the sport's largest salaries quicker and higher than ever. And they'll continue to skyrocket as the league's new TV deal comes into effect next season, bringing with it a surge of new money.</p><p>Last summer, the NBA and its television partners signed an 11-year contract worth $76 billion, or nearly $7 billion per season. For comparison, the old TV deal, which expired at the end of the 2024-25 Finals, was worth $24 billion over nine years, or almost $2.7 billion per season.</p><p>In other words, the new national rights deal will give the NBA about 2.6 times as much money per season as the one it replaced.</p><p>That influx of cash will have a profound impact on the salary cap, and by extension, the supermax. The last time the NBA added new multiples of national TV money, the salary cap leapt by 34% in one summer, giving the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"77a8546f-24bf-a333-8161-bf9f75396c49\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> enough space to sign <a data-player-guid=\"dc324fde-eee8-98e2-09ac-d31d8ad9909e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\">Kevin Durant</a>. To prevent a repeat, the new CBA includes \"cap smoothing\" measures, with maximum cap increases of 10% each season.</p><p>The salary cap will indeed increase by 10% next season, raising the starting supermax salary by 10%. In 2026-27, however, the NBA projects a 7% increase, as the collapse of regional sports networks reduces the amount of local TV revenue for the league.</p><p>Even if it's not as dramatic as a one-time 34% increase, repeated 7% or 10% jumps will have a similar leaguewide effect after a few years. Consider this illustration: The salary cap will pass $150 million for the first time next season, but it could double and pass $300 million by 2033-34. Such is the power of compound interest.</p><p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0711/r1517535_1296x729_16-9.png\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>The resulting effect on supermax salaries is staggering. When <a data-player-guid=\"5dda51f1-50c9-66e1-2026-400b73f34fad\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry\">Stephen Curry</a> became the first player to sign a supermax for the 2017-18 season, the cap was $99 million, so 35% meant his contract started at $34.7 million.</p><p>It took five years for the supermax value to rise above $40 million. But then the pace sped up as the salary cap climbed: three more years to eclipse $50 million, a projected two more years to reach $60 million and only one additional projected year to pass $70 million.</p><p>Larger first-year salaries also mean larger raises over the course of a supermax deal. This chart shows the projected starting and ending salaries for upcoming classes of four-year supermaxes, assuming -- for the sake of this maximal projection -- annual 10% cap increases after 2026-27. SGA's contract, for instance, will start at $63.7 million when it begins in 2027-28 and rise to $79 million by Year 4. Other players who sign a supermax after him will eclipse the $82 million mark, or $1 million per game, by the end of their deals.</p><p>This chart is predicated on a few assumptions: First, the supermax structure will remain the same after the CBA expires at the end of the decade; and second, that the league will return to 10% salary cap increases after 2026-27. That might not be likely, so here's that same chart with 7% annual increases instead.</p><hr><h2>Top candidates to reach $1 million per game</h2><p>Based on those charts, the best bets to reach $1 million per game first are players who will sign supermax deals after Gilgeous-Alexander, who was drafted in 2018.</p><p>Among the 2019 draft class, <a data-player-guid=\"de5f87e0-8571-a730-ade4-6d00d10b8577\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4279888/ja-morant\">Ja Morant</a> is the only player to make an All-NBA team, and that was three years ago. It seems unlikely anyone in this draft class will qualify for the supermax.</p><p>However, the 2020 draft class offers two top candidates for supermax qualification: <a data-player-guid=\"a2edb458-a371-3fba-ba5a-b24dd2fd2d9e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4594268/anthony-edwards\">Anthony Edwards</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"c4a0ba92-4e50-60af-a617-3345255115a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396993/tyrese-haliburton\">Tyrese Haliburton</a>. It's unknown for Haliburton since he'll miss all of next season due to an untimely Achilles tear. But Edwards has made two All-NBA second teams in a row, putting him on track to sign a supermax in the summer of 2027, which could be worth up to four years and $345 million and rise above $82 million in the second season.</p><p>If not Edwards, two members of the 2021 draft class made their first All-NBA teams last season: <a data-player-guid=\"c28c6569-86f0-3c1e-bcab-b946fbc06ff6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432166/cade-cunningham\">Cade Cunningham</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"27839f34-323e-31ce-9bfb-3708571bef5a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432158/evan-mobley\">Evan Mobley</a>.

Just this week, the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"c6eade89-5971-0e84-8ccb-cd91482b2b50\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns</a>' <a data-player-guid=\"493046d7-fa60-d8a1-1397-b9a6dca8dedf\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker</a> agreed to a new two-year extension worth up to $145 million, which carries a higher annual value than SGA's recently signed supermax (though because his deal is shorter, it won't reach as high by the end as SGA's).</p><hr><h2>NBA following other leagues</h2><p>Although a player making a million dollars per game is unprecedented in basketball, other sports have already surpassed that number.</p><p>At the start of the 2020s, Major League Baseball pitchers such as <a data-player-guid=\"af61347b-c222-7604-92c0-be4da7756430\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32081/gerrit-cole\">Gerrit Cole</a> and <a data-player-guid=\"4c623fea-1d3d-bc16-bae8-1cd6b1bc755d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/6341/justin-verlander\">Justin Verlander</a> began to cross $35 million per season, or more than $1 million per game in roughly 32 starts. This is a useful model for the NBA. Public advanced stat models estimate that the best basketball players are worth about 20 wins per season, which comes out to about one win in every four games. Similarly, the best baseball pitchers are worth about eight wins above replacement per year, or the same one in four math.</p><p>This isn't a perfect comparison, but the best NBA players have about as much impact on winning a single game as an MLB ace on the mound, so it's logical that their salaries would follow suit.</p><p>Other leagues pay their players even more. In the NFL, 84 players have cap hits of $17 million or higher this season, according to Spotrac, meaning they'll earn at least $1 million per game. The league's top quarterbacks make nearly $3 million per game -- which makes sense on a relative basis, given how much quarterbacks affect the result of games and given that each NFL game matters more in a shorter schedule in the richest sports league in the country.</p><p>Wealthiest of all are the elite soccer players the Saudi Pro League has recruited with exorbitant sums of money. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/22774/cristiano-ronaldo\">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is rumored to earn around $200 million a year.</p><p>But among team sports not funded by sovereign wealth funds, the NBA stands out with its combination of per-game pay and volume. MLB pitchers and NFL stars play only a fraction of the games as their NBA counterparts, so even if they make more on a per-game basis, their total compensation is still far below that of the NBA's supermax elite.</p><p>Consider this data point: Next season, 15 NBA players have cap hits of $50 million or higher, per Spotrac. The NFL, NHL and MLB have just two such contracts combined: <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"d08426cc-bf13-5d7b-5217-6d4662019bc6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets\">New York Mets</a> outfielder <a data-player-guid=\"c0225b71-161d-fe89-5c62-d27fa64259fd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36969/juan-soto\">Juan Soto</a> and <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"b0fc8fb7-9dbe-e574-9008-6f0ee7c6b234\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a> quarterback <a data-player-guid=\"5f09781b-6b0b-7325-049b-a91e60d794e6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a>.</p><hr><h2>Ripple effects of a soaring salary cap</h2><p>As star salaries soar, several possible ripple effects could emerge in the NBA. Load management could become even more of a lightning rod, for instance, with less tolerance for such highly compensated players missing games. It's easy to predict the criticism: <em>You're making more than a million dollars tonight, and you're not even playing?!</em></p><p>Higher salaries could also impact transactions. Some NBA stars could weigh factors other than money when making career decisions. It's natural for competitive athletes to desire the max, as a status symbol and a boon to their bank accounts. But as the numbers keep climbing, is there any tangible quality of life difference for making $75 million per year versus $85 million?</p><p>If not, stars could be more inclined to test the free agent market instead of re-signing with the team that can offer the supermax, knowing they'll gain multigenerational wealth regardless. Others could opt to sign for less than the maximum possible amount, to save money for teammates who would otherwise be unable to fit under the punitive second apron.</p><p>Finally, even if player salaries remain a constant percentage of the salary cap, the sheer numbers could grow so large that they provoke new conversations about whether NBA stars are overpaid. But here's the twist: SGA is <em>already</em> worth nine figures per season, even before his contract catches up.</p><hr><h2>Will superstars be worth $1 million per game?</h2><div data-behavior=\"video_scroll\"><figure data-video=\"watch,640,360,45643353,whitelist-BO|NG|NZ|GQ|AS|KE|SN|AI|PE|BM|GT|CI|MZ|BF|DO|VG|PY|EC|SX|LS|LC|CD|ST|VI|CG|BB|GN|NE|CL|VE|SS|CR|GU|SC|PR|TC|CM|MG|UG|BZ|UM|BR|SR|GP|MP|BJ|BI|TZ|CV|BS|KM|TG|ER|ET|FM|TT|GY|JM|ZA|ZW|CF|GD|GH|AW|BW|MS|PA|AM|KY|GF|AU|LR|US|AO|RE|SZ|GA|MX|GM|MW|HT|PW|MH|MF|FJ|MQ|BQ|NA|VC|AG|MU|NI|KN|UY|GW|GB|UK|SL|HN|SV|CO|ZM|CU|RW|ML|\" data-cerebro-id=\"68652f992c1a6662c3143a14\" data-title=\"Are LeBron James and Steph Curry done winning titles?\" data-source=\"espn\"><picture><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0702%2Fdm_250702_LeBron_James_and_Steph_Curry_done_winning_titles%2Fdm_250702_LeBron_James_and_Steph_Curry_done_winning_titles.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cquality=80&amp;format=jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 376px)\"><source data-srcset=\"https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0702%2Fdm_250702_LeBron_James_and_Steph_Curry_done_winning_titles%2Fdm_250702_LeBron_James_and_Steph_Curry_done_winning_titles.jpg&amp;w=335&amp;cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F0702%2Fdm_250702_LeBron_James_and_Steph_Curry_done_winning_titles%2Fdm_250702_LeBron_James_and_Steph_Curry_done_winning_titles.jpg&amp;w=670&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 375px)\"></picture><span data-id=\"45643353\">play</span><figcaption><p>1:14</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>Are LeBron James and Steph Curry done winning titles?</p><p>Tim Bontemps breaks down the Lakers' and Warriors' title hopes with LeBron James and Stephen Curry and why the Lakers' future hinges on Luka Doncic's commitment.</p></div></div><p>Last season, between salaries and luxury tax payments, NBA teams shelled out $5.65 billion, according to Spotrac data. There are 1,230 wins available in the regular season, so that comes out to $4.6 million per win. (There's a nerdy debate to be had about whether to factor in wrinkles like minimum salaries and replacement levels to determine the \"true\" cost of a win. But this simple calculation suffices for now, and if anything, including those other factors would make stars seem <em>more</em> valuable, not less.)</p><p>Multiply that sum by Gilgeous-Alexander's league-leading total of 20.9 estimated wins of value, per Dunks &amp; Threes, and you get $96 million in regular-season value. And that's before accounting for how SGA led his team to the championship, or increased his franchise's ticket and merchandise sales, or boosted Oklahoma City's franchise value.</p><p>For reference, when <a data-player-guid=\"1f6592b3-ff53-d321-8dc5-6038d48c1786\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> returned to the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"ec79ad1f-e6d2-7762-a2db-7fe97d35126b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45711806/www.forbes.com/sites/prishe/2014/07/11/a-tale-of-two-franchise-values-how-lebrons-return-to-cleveland-impacts-cavaliers-heat\">Forbes estimated</a> that he \"immediately elevate[d] the Cavaliers franchise value by at least $100 million to $150 million.\" That figure would surely be higher now after another decade of inflation.</p><p>Given the presence of contract maximums and the relative importance of stars in the NBA, the league's best players have long signed for discounts, relative to their production, and that will still be true at $1 million per game or more. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/16636616/is-cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-worth-100-million-year-2016-nba-free-agency\">ESPN's Kevin Pelton calculated</a> that, taking all these factors together, \"in a world without limits on player salaries, the Cavaliers could easily justify offering James $100 million a year.\"</p><p>As Pelton noted, that was more than the entire salary cap at the time, similar to how Michael Jordan made more than the entire salary cap for the <a data-clubhouse-guid=\"e588ccf1-ba03-ea43-c34c-9a9c8d1895ca\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\">Chicago Bulls</a> in the late 1990s, before the NBA introduced the max contract structure. The same math in 2025 would place top stars' value north of $150 million per year -- or nearly <em>double</em> the $1 million per game threshold.</p><p>That's not true for every player on a max contract -- in a zero-sum environment, there will always be players who exceed their value and others who fall short -- but for the LeBrons and Jordans and SGAs of the world, for the truly franchise-altering, league-defining players, this takeaway is clear.</p><p>A supermax salary that reaches $1 million per game won't just be a milestone when it's finally reached in the next several years. It will also be a bargain.</p>\n</div></div>",

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they were partners in an extraordinary exercise -- and now, for the first time in decades, they are looking at a stack of letters and photographs from that period of their lives.</p><p>The letters are mostly handwritten, by children, from all over the United States and Canada, and beyond.</p><p><em>\"Dear Mr. Abbott ...\"</em></p><p><em>\"I have one hand too. ... I don't know any one with one hand. How do you feel about having one hand? Sometimes I feel sad and sometimes I feel okay about it. Most of the time I feel happy.\"</em></p><p><em>\"I am a seventh grader with a leg that is turned inwards. How do you feel about your arm? I would also like to know how you handle your problem? I would like to know, if you don't mind, what have you been called?\"</em></p><p><em>\"I can't use my right hand and most of my right side is paralyzed. ... I want to become a doctor and seeing you makes me think I can be what I want to be.\"</em></p><p>For 40 years, Mead worked in communications for the California Angels, eventually becoming vice president of media relations. His position in this department became a job like no other after the Angels drafted Abbott out of the University of Michigan in 1988.</p><p>There was a deluge of media requests. Reporters from around the world descended on Anaheim, most hoping to get one-on-one time with the young left-handed pitcher with the scorching fastball. Every Abbott start was a major event -- \"like the World Series,\" Angels scout Bob Fontaine Jr. remembers. Abbott, with his impressive amateur résumé (he won the James E. Sullivan Award for the nation's best amateur athlete in 1997 and an Olympic gold medal in 1988) and his boyish good looks, had star power.</p><p>That spring, he had become only the 16th player to go straight from the draft to the majors without appearing in a single minor league game. And then there was the factor that made him unique. His limb difference, although no one called it that back then. Abbott was born without a right hand, yet had developed into one of the most promising pitchers of his generation. He would go on to play in the majors for ten years, including a stint in the mid '90s with the Yankees highlighted by a no-hitter in 1993.</p><p>Abbott, and Mead, too, knew the media would swarm. That was no surprise. There had been swarms in college, and at the Olympics, wherever and whenever Abbott pitched. Who could resist such an inspirational story? But what they hadn't anticipated were the letters.</p><p>The steady stream of letters. Thousands of letters. So many from kids who, like Abbott, were different. Letters from their parents and grandparents. The kids hoping to connect with someone who reminded them of themselves, the first celebrity they knew of who could understand and appreciate what it was like to be them, someone who had experienced the bullying and the feelings of otherness. The parents and grandparents searching for hope and direction.</p><p><em>\"I know you don't consider yourself limited in what you can do ... but you are still an inspiration to my wife and I as parents. Your success helps us when talking to Andy at those times when he's a little frustrated. I'm able to point to you and assure him there's no limit to what he can accomplish.\"</em></p><p>In his six seasons with the Angels, Abbott was assisted by Mead in the process of organizing his responses to the letters, mailing them, and arranging face-to-face meetings with the families who had written to him. There were scores of such meetings. It was practically a full-time job for both of them.</p><p>\"Thinking back on these meetings with families -- and that's the way I'd put it, it's families, not just kids -- there was every challenge imaginable,\" Abbott, now 57, says. \"Some accidents. Some birth defects. Some mental challenges that aren't always visible to people when you first come across somebody. ... They saw something in playing baseball with one hand that related to their own experience. I think the families coming to the ballparks were looking for hopefulness. I think they were looking for what it had been that my parents had told me, what it had been that my coaches had told me. ... [With the kids] it was an interaction. It was catch. It was smiling. It was an autograph. It was a picture. With the parents, it ran deeper. With the parents, it was what had your parents said to you? What coaches made a difference? What can we expect? Most of all, I think, what can we expect?\"</p><p>\"It wasn't asking for autographs,\" Mead says of all those letters. \"They weren't asking for pictures. They were asking for his time. He and I had to have a conversation because this was going to be unique. You know, you could set up another player to come down and sign 15 autographs for this group or whatever. But it was people, parents, that had kids, maybe babies, just newborn babies, almost looking for an assurance that this is going to turn out all right, you know. 'What did your parents do? How did your parents handle this?'\"</p><p>One of the letters Abbott received came from an 8-year-old girl in Windsor, Ontario.</p><p>She wrote, <em>\"Dear Jim, My name is Tracey Holgate. I am age 8. I have one hand too. My grandpa gave me a picture of you today. I saw you on TV. I don't know anyone with one hand. How do you feel about having one hand? Sometimes I feel sad and sometimes I feel okay about it. Most of the time I feel happy. I hope to see you play in Detroit and maybe meet you. Could you please send me a picture of you in uniform? Could you write back please? Here is a picture of me. Love, Tracey.\"</em></p><p>Holgate's letter is one of those that has remained preserved in a folder -- and now Abbott is reading it again, at his kitchen table, half a lifetime after receiving it. Time has not diminished the power of the letter, and Abbott is wiping away tears.</p><p>Today, Holgate is 44 and goes by her married name, Dupuis. She is married with four children of her own. She is a teacher. When she thinks about the meaning of Jim Abbott in her life, it is about much more than the letter he wrote back to her. Or the autographed picture he sent her. It was Abbott, all those years ago, who made it possible for Tracey to dream.</p><p>\"There was such a camaraderie there,\" she says, \"an ability to connect with somebody so far away doing something totally different than my 8-year-old self was doing, but he really allowed me to just feel that connection, to feel that I'm not alone, there's other people that have differences and have overcome them and been successful and we all have our own crosses, we all have our own things that we're carrying and it's important to continue to focus on the gifts that we have, the beauty of it.</p><p>\"I think sometimes differences, disabilities, all those things can be a gift in a package we would never have wanted, because they allow us to be people that have an empathetic heart, an understanding heart, and to see the pain in the people around us.\"</p><p>Now, years after Abbott's career ended, he continues to inspire.</p><p>Among those he influenced, there are professional athletes, such as Shaquem Griffin, who in 2018 became the first NFL player with one hand. Griffin, now 29, played three seasons at linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks.</p><p>Growing up in Florida, he would watch videos of Abbott pitching and fielding, over and over, on YouTube.</p><p>\"The only person I really looked up to was Jim Abbott at the time,\" Griffin says, \"which is crazy, because I didn't know anybody else to look up to. I didn't know anybody else who was kind of like me. And it's funny, because when I was really little, I used to be like, 'Why me? Why this happen to me?' And I used to be in my room thinking about that. And I used to think to myself, 'I wonder if Jim Abbott had that same thought.'\"</p><p>Carson Pickett was born on Sept. 15, 1993 -- 11 days after Abbott's no-hitter. Missing most of her left arm below the elbow, she became, in 2022, the first player with a limb difference to appear for the U.S. women's national soccer team.</p><p>She, too, says that Abbott made things that others told her were impossible seem attainable.</p><p>\"I knew I wanted to be a professional soccer player,\" says Pickett, who is currently playing for the NWSL's Orlando Pride. \"To be able to see him compete at the highest level it gave me hope, and I think that that kind of helped me throughout my journey. ... I think 'pioneer' would be the best word for him.\"</p><p>Longtime professional MMA fighter Nick Newell is 39, old enough to have seen Abbott pitch for the Yankees. In fact, when Newell was a child he met Abbott twice, first at a fan event at the Jacob Javits Center in Manhattan and then on a game day at Yankee Stadium. Newell was one of those kids with a limb difference -- like Griffin and Pickett, due to amniotic band syndrome -- who idolized Abbott.</p><p>\"And I didn't really understand the gravity of what he was doing,\" Newell says now, \"but for me, I saw someone out there on TV that looked like I did. And I was the only other person I knew that had one hand. And I saw this guy out here playing baseball and it was good to see somebody that looked like me, and I saw him in front of the world.</p><p>\"He was out there like me and he was just living his life and I think that I owe a lot of my attitude and the success that I have to Jim just going out there and being the example of, 'Hey, you can do this. Who's to say you can't be a professional athlete?' He's out there throwing no-hitters against the best baseball players in the world. So, as I got older, 'Why can't I wrestle? Why can't I fight? Why can't I do this?' And then it wasn't until the internet that I heard people tell me I can't do these things. But by then I had already been doing those things.\"</p><p>Griffin.</p><p>Pickett.</p><p>Newell.</p><p>Just three of the countless kids who were inspired by Jim Abbott.</p><p>When asked if it ever felt like too much, being a role model and a hero, all the letters and face-to-face meetings, Abbott says no -- but it wasn't always easy.</p><p>\"I had incredible people who helped me send the letters,\" he says. \"I got a lot more credit sometimes than I deserved for these interactions, to be honest with you. And that happened on every team, particularly with my friend Tim Mead. There was a nice balance to it. There really was. There was a heaviness to it. There's no denying. There were times I didn't want to go [to the meetings]. I didn't want to walk out there. I didn't want to separate from my teammates. I didn't want to get up from the card game. I didn't want to put my book down. I liked where I was at. I was in my environment. I was where I always wanted to be. In a big league clubhouse surrounded by big league teammates. In a big league stadium. And those reminders of being different, I slowly came to realize were never going to go away.\"</p><p>But being different was the thing that made Abbott more than merely a baseball star. For many people, he has been more than a role model, more than an idol. He is the embodiment of hope and belonging.</p><p>\"I think more people need to realize and understand the gift of a difference,\" Dupuis says. \"I think we have to just not box everybody in and allow everybody's innate light to shine, and for whatever reasons we've been created to be here, [let] that light shine in a way that it touches everybody else. Because I think that's what Jim did. He allowed his light to permeate and that light, in turn, lit all these little children's lights all over the world, so you have this boom of brightness that's happening and that's uncontrollable, that's beautiful.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/watch/catalog/486e4477-063d-49ad-aabf-7004f2a21607\"><em>\"Southpaw - The Life and Legacy of Jim Abbott,\" a new edition of ESPN's \"E60,\" debuts Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on ESPN; extended version streaming afterward on ESPN+.</em></a></p>\n</div></div>",

Washington Nationals </strong></h2><p><strong>Kade Anderson, LHP, LSU</strong><br>\n<strong>Rank: 1</strong></p><p>There is a lot of uncertainty at this pick after the firing of GM Mike Rizzo. The effect, if you believe the buzz in the industry, is that Anderson is now a little more likely to be the pick. I think it stands at about a 55% chance it will be Anderson, 35% for Ethan Holliday and 10% for Eli Willits/others.</p><p>Willits and maybe Liam Doyle seem to be the leading cut-rate options rather than prep ace Seth Hernandez, which may be another effect of interim GM Mike DeBartolo rather than Rizzo being at the helm.</p><hr><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/mlb/500/laa.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\"></p><h2><strong>2. Los Angeles Angels </strong></h2><p><strong>Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee</strong><br>\n<strong>Rank: 6</strong></p><p>Doyle has been tied here for a while, and with good reason: He would probably take a below-slot deal and he is a strong candidate to be first player to the big leagues in this entire class. Given his dominating fastball, he could get big league hitters out right now, and the Angels may be aggressive and let him do just that, then see if they can make him a long-term starter.</p><p>Kade Anderson seems like the top guy on the Angels' board, though, and thus probably would be the pick here if he doesn't go No. 1. In this scenario, I think this decision will come down to Doyle, Jamie Arnold or bigger cut versus slot-in Ike Irish. I give Doyle the slight edge.</p><p>The Angels love Daniel Pierce but likely can't land him. Keep an eye on Mason Pike and Sam Horn as the starter targets along with basically any college arm with reliever risk at later picks: Brian Curley, Cade Obermueller, Chase Shores, Tanner Franklin, A.J.

It was his bobblehead day, meaning the first 10,000 fans to walk through the gates at Target Field would receive a replica of Buxton doing his \"Buck Truck\" home run celebration.</p><p>\"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous before the game started, just knowing it was bobblehead day,\" Buxton said. \"Obviously you want to come out and do something good.\"</p><p>Buxton did more than something good. He became the first player to hit for the cycle at Target Field since the ballpark opened in 2010, helping ignite the Twins to a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/game/_/gameId/401696336/pirates-twins\">12-4 win</a> over the Pirates.</p><p>It was the 12th cycle in Twins history and the first since <a data-player-guid=\"ddce8b46-7c9e-20b5-7e99-56723808563b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32525/jorge-polanco\">Jorge Polanco</a> had one in 2019.</p><p>Buxton had three hits through three innings -- a single in the first, a triple in the six-run second and a double in the third. After singling again in the fifth, he had one more opportunity in the bottom of the seventh.</p><p>Buxton, who will participate in next week's Home Run Derby in Atlanta, crushed a 427-foot solo homer off Pirates reliever <a data-player-guid=\"d29f257c-2b4a-fcbc-3a30-a5914381e53f\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32672/andrew-heaney\">Andrew Heaney</a> with two outs in the seventh to make it an 11-3 game and complete the cycle. That brought the Target Field crowd to its feet, with many fans celebrating with Buxton bobbleheads.</p><p>With his team holding a comfortable lead, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli almost took Buxton out of the game before his final at-bat, he admitted afterward. Thankfully for Baldelli -- and Buxton -- a few coaches reminded the skipper what was at stake.</p><p>\"He was 4 for 4 at the time. But with everything going on during a game, sometimes I'll be the one that might miss on a hitting streak or something that's going on with a particular player,\" Baldelli said. \"But once they reminded me of that, he was going to stay in the game. He was going to get another at-bat, regardless of the score, and give him a chance to do something great.\"</p><p>The homer was Buxton's 21st of the season, tied for fifth most in the American League. With two runs driven in Saturday, Buxton now has 55 RBIs on the season -- just one shy of his single-season high. He boasts an OPS of .921 and is 17 for 17 in stolen bases.</p><p>\"It's one of the greatest first halves I've ever witnessed,\" Baldelli said.</p><p>Buxton was replaced in center field after the seventh inning, but not before getting a standing ovation curtain call from Twins fans. He also received a Gatorade bath courtesy of teammate <a data-player-guid=\"53b65b61-99f4-b102-24c1-7138251ddd24\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35591/ty-france\">Ty France</a>, who was headed to the clubhouse before realizing that nobody had doused Buxton yet after the game.</p><p>\"It's special,\" Buxton said. \"To be able to come out on bobblehead day like this and have a day like this is something I won't forget.\"</p>\n</div></div>",

A junior champion at the All England Club in 2018, she had never been past the quarterfinals in the main draw. Her only other final on grass came when she was the runner-up at a tuneup event in Germany right before Wimbledon began.</p><p>But on Saturday -- following a tournament run that saw her drop just one set and six service games -- Swiatek became the eighth women's player, and only active one, to win a major title on all three surfaces.</p><p>Swiatek broke Anisimova in the first game of the match and needed just 57 minutes to become the first Polish woman to win Wimbledon.</p><p>It was just the third women's major final to feature a 6-0, 6-0 score, and the second in the Open era, after Steffi Graf's win against Natasha Zvereva at the 1988 French Open. The double bagel had happened at Wimbledon only once prior, in 1911 when Dorothea Lambert Chambers defeated Dora Boothby.</p><p>\"She came out playing very, very well,\" Anisimova said. \"So all the credit to her. She was able to really play the game she wanted. ... I think I was a bit frozen there with my nerves. Maybe the last two weeks I got a bit tired or something. She definitely made it difficult for me. She's an unbelievable player ... she deserves this win.\"</p><p>Swiatek, who earned her 100th major win in her 120th career match, became the fastest woman to 100 major match wins since <a data-player-guid=\"cc4fbfff-5162-cb94-e0aa-500d3227a300\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=394\">Serena Williams</a>, who reached the mark in 116 matches at the 2004 US Open.</p><p>Swiatek also improved to 6-0 in major finals, joining Monica Seles with the second-longest win streak to start a career in the Open era, after <a data-player-guid=\"6bf3e1d1-c102-93e9-a4e9-32ba6e82f887\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=425\">Roger Federer</a> (7-0).</p><p>No woman has won more titles than Swiatek since she captured her first at the 2020 French Open; Wimbledon marked her 23rd tour-level singles title and also her first on grass. But it had been a challenging year for Swiatek, who hadn't won a title anywhere since the 2024 French Open after spending most of 2022, 2023 and 2024 at No. 1 in the WTA rankings.</p><p>The overwhelming favorite at last month's French Open, Swiatek was upset by top-ranked <a data-player-guid=\"c91d133a-526a-ea8d-654c-7ef6915ad63b\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3038\">Aryna Sabalenka</a> in the semifinals, and her ranking plummeted to No. 8. She went 15 straight WTA main draw events without claiming a title, the second-longest drought of her career.</p><p>During that stretch, Swiatek fired longtime coach Tomasz Wiktorowski and started working with Wim Fissette. She also served a one-month doping ban last year after failing an out-of-competition drug test; an investigation determined she was inadvertently exposed to a contaminated medical product used for trouble with sleeping and jet lag.</p><p>The loss to Sabalenka at Roland Garros gave Swiatek more time to prepare for the grass-court season -- something she hadn't gotten much of a chance to do in recent years. She spent five days in Mallorca training on the surface before heading to Germany to continue practicing with other players. She then reached her first grass final at Bad Homburg, just two days before the main draw at Wimbledon got underway.</p><p>While the opening rounds of Wimbledon were filled with upsets, Swiatek remained focused and relentless as other top seeds made early exits, dropping just one set against <a data-player-guid=\"10a07158-d00a-f8d6-54e0-f43a7d0c603e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3223\">Catherine McNally</a> and seemingly improving with every match.</p><p>Swiatek appeared to raise her level even more Saturday against Anisimova, winning 55 of 79 points and holding Anisimova to just nine points in the opening set. Anisimova, nervy from the start, made 28 unforced errors.</p><p>When asked her secret to being so strong in finals throughout her career, Swiatek shrugged and laughed before answering.</p><p>\"I think tennis is a mental sport, but also you need everything to win tournaments ... good tennis, good physicality, being also not tired, have good matches before so you don't spend too much time on the court, having great focus,\" Swiatek said. \"Finals sometimes are a bit ugly because there's so much stress and everything. I kind of used the experience from before.</p><p>\"Today I just wanted to enjoy the time that I had on the Centre Court and enjoy the last hours of me playing well on grass, because who knows if it's going to happen again. I just focused on that, and I really had fun.\"</p><p>It was the first tour-level meeting between Swiatek and Anisimova; they had played just once before, as teenagers at the 2016 junior Fed Cup.</p><p>Wimbledon marked a breakthrough tournament for Anisimova, the fourth consecutive American woman to reach a major final. The 23-year-old had a promising start to her career, reaching the French Open semifinals in 2019 at age 17, but she has had her fair share of struggles since, including injuries and the unexpected death of her father, who had also been her childhood coach.</p><p>Anisimova took a mental health break away from the tour a little more than two years ago. A year ago, she tried to qualify for Wimbledon, because her ranking of 189th was too low to get into the field automatically, but she lost in the preliminary event.</p><p>Anisimova became just the second woman in the Open era to reach a major final after losing in qualifying at the same major the year prior, joining 2019 US Open champion <a data-player-guid=\"6fd6b28f-61b2-9ac1-4a0e-cd5bd4a3aa20\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2979\">Bianca Andreescu</a>. On Monday, she'll break into the top 10 in the rankings for the first time.</p><p>Swiatek's victory Saturday was a surprise even to her. In the on-court ceremony, she said winning Wimbledon wasn't something she had ever even dreamed of because it was \"just way too far.\"</p><p>She later elaborated and said Wimbledon, along with her win at the 2022 US Open, was particularly meaningful because \"no one expected\" either of them.</p><p>And that lack of pressure, she said, allowed her to play her best tennis over the fortnight.</p><p>\"Finally no one was telling me to win everything,\" Swiatek said. \"So coming here, I could really focus on getting better and developing as a player rather than everybody just asking me to win, win, and nothing is good besides winning.</p><p>\"Even if [lack of grass-court success] was too big of a story, I kind of enjoyed that because expectations were a bit lower.\"</p><p><em>ESPN Research and The Associated Press contributed to this report. </em></p>\n</div></div>",

Will that give him the edge? Our experts weigh in on how each could pull off the victory.</p><hr><h2>What can Alcaraz do to defeat Sinner?</h2><p><b>D'Arcy Maine: </b>Alcaraz has proved he can beat Sinner when the stakes are highest, and he knows what it takes to win at Wimbledon. After he defeated <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/player/_/id/2946/taylor-fritz\">Taylor Fritz</a> in the semifinals Friday, Fritz complimented Alcaraz's versatility, \"his ability to win in so many ways,\" and how he can make adjustments on the fly.</p><p>Those traits were key in Alcaraz's win over Sinner at the French Open and they will be equally valuable Sunday. Undefeated in his previous five major finals, Alcaraz has remarkable composure and fight, especially for being just 22, and if he is able to continue to find answers for everything Sinner hits his way by utilizing his staggering variety, this is his match to win.</p><p><strong>Bill Connelly: </strong>Same thing I said before the French Open final: Keep going for it. Heading into that match, the bar was basically \"hit winners on over 20% of your points, and you'll beat Sinner,\" and after hitting just 12.9% in the first two sets, Alcaraz was at 21.7% in the last three (25.0% in the fifth set).</p><p>If you don't play a big game and go for winners, Sinner will grind you into dust. Alcaraz honestly hasn't been incredibly sharp in this tournament, dropping at least one set in four of six matches and clearing that 20% bar only twice (in his two straight-set wins, naturally). But he's pretty good at rising to the occasion -- five Slam finals, five wins -- so one assumes he'll be ready to swing big.</p><p><strong>Simon Cambers: </strong>Do what he always does: Find a way to win, with whatever strategy is required. Sinner will hit hard, on both wings, so the key for Alcaraz is to use his variety. His drop shot will be important, as will be his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/45718873/wimbledon-2025-serve-volley-effective-alcaraz-djokovic-shelton\">use of serve-and-volley</a>, if and when the opportunity arises. Overall, he needs to serve as well as he did against Fritz in the semis; if he does that, he'll take so much pressure off his second serve, which is vital as Sinner will hammer anything he has a look at. Alcaraz has the edge in movement on grass so he'll look to exploit that, coming forward when he can. If he does that, he'll be in control.</p><hr><h2>What can Sinner do to defeat Alcaraz?</h2><p><b>Maine: </b>Trust himself. His elbow is showing no signs of injury at this point, so it's going to be largely mental for Sinner on Sunday. It's his first Wimbledon final and, of course, he's just over a month removed from what happened in Paris. There understandably will be nerves and he will likely have doubts, especially as he is well aware he hasn't defeated Alcaraz since 2023.</p><p>How can he stop those doubts from creeping in and what will he do if they come into play? Like he did when he was down a break in the third set Friday against <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/player/_/id/296/novak-djokovic\">Novak Djokovic</a> and his forehand began to (briefly) betray him, Sinner kept fighting, winning points in the long rallies and stifling all signs of Djokovic's momentum to then win five straight games. He will need to bring that same mentality -- and more -- against Alcaraz.</p><p>Except for his fourth-round match against <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/player/_/id/1287/grigor-dimitrov\">Grigor Dimitrov</a>, Sinner has been mostly unstoppable and hasn't lost a set throughout the fortnight. He has the game and the ability, and his movement and footwork continue to get better on grass with every match. He was seemingly <i>everywhere</i> on the court against Djokovic. If he can bring the same level he has shown for most of the tournament, and be equally resilient and mentally strong, he has a chance.</p><p><strong>Connelly: </strong>Dominate on serve. While Alcaraz has been serving better and better over the course of the tournament -- he won 64% of his service points in the first three rounds and 76% in the next three against higher-ranked competition -- his return game has come and gone. In the five sets he has dropped at Wimbledon, he has basically allowed opponents to serve as effectively as he does. That was especially true in the semifinal against Fritz, in which Fritz won 83% of his service points while winning the second set, and 74% while sending the fourth set to a tiebreaker.</p><p>Against Djokovic, maybe the best returner of all time, in the semifinals, Sinner landed his first serve 74% of the time and won 77% of his service points. He almost beat Alcaraz at the French Open despite landing only 54% of his first serves last month, and he'll save himself a lot of trouble if he can raise that number to more normal levels and control the game on serve.</p><p><strong>Cambers: </strong>Remind himself how far he's come to this point and tell himself he is the underdog. The pressure is probably more on Alcaraz to win a third straight title than it is for Sinner to perform in his first Wimbledon final, so that should ease any mental stresses that will inevitably come. Sinner's groundstrokes are so hard that he can hit through anyone, and if he can get a look at enough second serves, he'll really fancy his chances.</p><p>What's fascinating is how quickly Sinner has shrugged off the enormous disappointment of holding three match points against Alcaraz in the final at Roland Garros, to reach the Wimbledon final. In some ways, maybe banging his elbow against Dimitrov has actually helped him; instead of worrying about the mental baggage of Paris, he's focused on his body and let the tennis just flow.</p><p>If he returns the Alcaraz first serve well, he's going to have a big chance here. The grass is hard this year, after all the dry weather, which will help him too. Of course he'll need to serve well, and if he can also come forward a little more than he has, he'll keep Alcaraz pinned back.</p><hr><h2>Who will win?</h2><p><strong>Pam Shriver: </strong>The winner will be the one who is physically feeling their best on the day, after two weeks of grueling grass-court pressure tennis. Obviously, Alcaraz has the upper hand psychologically at the moment, but we <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/27163773/what-youth-movement-big-three-dominate-wimbledon\">saw many stages of the Big Three rivalries</a> over the 20 years, so expect the same in this exceptional rivalry.</p><p>Alcaraz has the edge both on grass and the rivalry at the moment, but Sinner can start to flip that on Sunday, especially if his elbow is fine and he feels more comfortable moving on the grass at the close of the fortnight. Tennis is lucky to have these two athletes leading men's tennis, and I can't wait to watch. The Roland Garros final is an impossible act to follow, but let's see what these two phenoms can produce.</p><p><strong>Maine:</strong> Sinner has more motivation than ever, and likely more confidence and endurance now than he did at the French Open, but experience will ultimately help Alcaraz in the tightest moments of the match. While I don't think it will go past the five-hour mark like the final in Paris, I do think it could easily go to a deciding set, and that favors Alcaraz, who has a ridiculous 14-1 record in five-setters and is 10-1 in matches that extend past three hours and 50 minutes (compared to 0-7 for Sinner). Alcaraz in five, dramatic, highlight-filled sets.</p><p><strong>Connelly: </strong>On the natural surfaces, where Alcaraz has had a clear advantage over Sinner (and everyone else in the world), I feel like Sinner has made up a lot of ground in a short amount of time. He actually won one more point than Alcaraz in their French Open battle, and while he was injured and wobbly -- and lucky -- against Dimitrov in the fourth round, he has been virtually automatic since.</p><p>Alcaraz's ceiling is higher than basically anything we've ever seen, and the way he conjured up absolute perfection at the exact moment he needed to in Paris was awe-inspiring. But Sinner's just so steady, and he seems to still be improving. Sinner in four.</p><p><strong>Cambers: </strong>I picked Alcaraz at the start, which was hardly a stretch, given his two titles in a row here. But he's shown at every turn why he's the best player in the world on grass, he moves better than anyone, he mixes things up incredibly well and he has that charisma that gets the crowd on his side right from the first ball.</p><p>Sinner is a phenomenal player and no one hits the ball harder. But on grass, the subtleties required fall more in Alcaraz's wheelhouse. I can see it being long -- of course -- but the fact that he's won their last five matches is a huge psychological advantage for him. Even if Sinner has done brilliantly to shrug off what happened in Paris, Alcaraz has the mental boost of winning from match points down in his pocket, ready to pull out if and when he needs it. It could go five, but I'll say Alcaraz in four tight sets.</p>\n</div></div>",

If she had taken the advice of trainer Ross Enamait and promoter Eddie Hearn and used constant movement, a quick check hook and right hands in a more measured, yet not nearly as exciting style, it's highly unlikely that there would have been a second and third fight. More importantly, women's boxing may not have the stage it had on Netflix in front of millions of viewers.</p><p>Taylor fought Serrano's fight for the first 20 rounds of their trilogy and gave fans a pair of extraordinarily thrilling -- and incredibly close -- battles between two of the generation's best women's pound-for-pound fighters. What we found out in their third fight is that Taylor could have made this a lot easier on herself from the beginning had she deployed this game plan that her team had begged from her when her first fight was scheduled.</p><p>On Friday, she fought the way her team wanted her to, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45721455/katie-taylor-def-amanda-serrano-keeps-super-lightweight-title\">won a definitive majority decision</a> to close the book on their trilogy.</p><p>\"I said to Katie Taylor in the changing room, 'Can we just keep it simple and straightforward? Use your skill and use your speed. Can we have a nice night tonight?' For once, she listened,\" Hearn said after the fight.</p><p>Can you imagine where women's boxing would be had she taken that advice in the first fight? While it may be hyperbolic to suggest that there's no way an all-women's boxing card would be streamed on Netflix at a sold-out Madison Square Garden, there is certainly truth to the fact that the first two encounters between Taylor and Serrano put a spotlight on women's boxing like it never had before. The first fight in April 2022, which <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/33835408/katie-taylor-edges-amanda-serrano-split-decision-retain-undisputed-title\">Taylor won by a split decision</a>, proved that women could provide just as much excitement as the men and headline a card. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/42417518/katie-taylor-edges-amanda-serrano-controversial-decision\">The rematch last November</a> took it even further in another all-action fight that became the most watched women's sporting event in U.S. history, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/42294361/katie-taylor-amanda-serrano-getting-paid-the-rest-women-boxing\">with an average of 74 million live viewers</a> globally on Netflix <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/42352328/mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-live-boxing-updates-results-analysis\">as the co-main event</a> to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/38041591/jake-problem-child-paul-biography-record-fights-more\">Jake Paul</a> vs. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/39717002/mike-tyson-biography-boxing-record-fights-more\">Mike Tyson</a>.</p><p>Those two encounters set the stage for the highly anticipated trilogy and a card loaded with world champions, as 17 titles were up for grabs among five title fights. Women's boxing had never had the spotlight it had before Taylor-Serrano and several women on this card will have the opportunity to become household names because of this epic trilogy.</p><p>Even though there will be those who will complain that Taylor-Serrano 3 failed to live up to the hype, Taylor more than deserved to finally fight her fight and slam the door shut on her rivalry.</p><hr><h3>Amanda Serrano fought the wrong fight at the wrong time</h3><p>After two exhilarating and extraordinarily close encounters with Taylor, \"The Real Deal\" decided to try to box instead of brawl. That approach resulted in a less-than-thrilling encounter and led to a more decisive loss to Taylor. More importantly, it put an end to the chatter about who the better fighter is. It's definitively Taylor, who swept the series 3-0.</p><p>\"We tried something different,\" Serrano said after the loss. \"It was all about working smarter, not harder. I tried to keep my distance and tried not to go in there and fight with her because, apparently, it didn't work in the first two fights. We tried to just stick with the long punches, the one two, and I guess it just wasn't enough.\"</p><p>It definitely wasn't enough, and it can be debated that her more aggressive approach of swarming Taylor with punches <i>did</i> work better in the first two fights and was the reason why fans heavily debated who actually won in 2022 and 2024 even though Taylor was officially 2-0. Serrano's strategy for the first two fights was also the reason why women's boxing had the spotlight. Those epic encounters were full of fantastic action, with the first fight earning the honors of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/35204488/boxing-best-2022-knockouts-fights-fighters-year\">ESPN's women's fight of the year</a>.</p><p>Serrano entered Friday's fight with something to prove, and her fans who believed she should have at least won one of the first two fights had high hopes that she would finally get her hand raised. Instead, her performance fell flat.</p><p>This performance against Taylor doesn't erase the goodwill she earned from their first two meetings. But it certainly locked her in the history books behind Taylor.</p><hr><h3>An unlikely name rose to the occasion</h3><p>With the spotlight on an exceptional all-women's fight card, they all had an opportunity to make a name for themselves. While Alycia Baumgardner, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/38462060/chantelle-cameron-biography-boxing-record-fights-more\">Chantelle Cameron</a>, Ellie Scotney and others emerged victorious, one fighter who was a betting underdog made the most of the opportunity.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/35522496/shadasia-green-signs-jake-paul-promotional-group\">Shadasia Green was the second woman</a> that Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions signed with the hopes of building her from the ground up. She hit a major speed bump in her pro career in 2023 when she dropped a decision to Franchon Crews-Dezurn in her first attempt at a major world title. Green also failed to impress against Melinda Watpool on the undercard of Paul-Tyson, and there were concerns about whether she was worth the investment.</p><p>Green was paired with former undisputed super middleweight champion Savannah Marshall on the main card of Taylor-Serrano 3. Marshall, who had only lost a competitive decision to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/38448283/claressa-shields-biography-boxing-record-fights-more\">Claressa Shields</a> in 2022, was the heavy favorite to win. It looked as if Marshall was going to run away with the fight in the first few rounds, especially after Green was deducted a point in round four for excessive holding. Instead, \"The Sweet Terminator\" had a fire lit under her and proceeded to engage in an entertaining battle that earned her a hard-fought split decision win. Green's stunning upset earned her the $250,000 performance bonus from Most Valuable Promotions.</p><p>While the win was the biggest of Green's career, it also set up a potential blockbuster showdown with Shields. MVP's Paul and Nakisa Bidarian said they were more than willing to work with Shields, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/44489336/women-boxing-pound-pound-rankings-mikaela-mayer-moves-lauren-price-makes-top-10-debut\">ESPN's No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter</a>, to make a fight with Green happen.</p><p>While it may not happen next, Shields has desperately needed a new rival to fight. While Green is not as decorated as Shields, she could match her in the trash-talking department and has enough power to make some believe she could take out Shields.</p><p>It makes too much sense for Shields to do business with Paul. There's money to be made and Green put herself in a position to be in one of the biggest fights that can be made in women's boxing.</p>\n</div></div>",

Swiatek didn't seem concerned.</p><p>\"If I would lose here earlier, maybe I would be able to play two more weeks on grass and then be a better grass player,\" Swiatek said matter-of-factly. \"But if I had to choose, I love playing on clay, so I'm not going to give up that ever.\"</p><p>Swiatek then opted to skip all of the grass tournaments to focus on rest and recovery after the long clay season. She lost in the third round at the All England Club.</p><p>But this year, Swiatek did lose earlier at her beloved Roland Garros. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/45457723/aryna-sabalenka-ends-iga-swiatek-26-match-french-open-streak\">She was upset by world No. 1</a> <a data-player-guid=\"c91d133a-526a-ea8d-654c-7ef6915ad63b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3038\">Aryna Sabalenka</a> in the semifinals, ending her dream for a fourth consecutive title at the major. Swiatek -- albeit involuntarily -- did have more time to prepare for the grass.</p><p>Her words from a year ago turned out to be right: The additional weeks on the surface helped her become a better grass player. But even she likely couldn't have predicted just how good, and just how dominant, she would become. Or how she would thrive without the overwhelming attention and pressure that she faced at the French Open.</p><p>And she certainly couldn't have guessed that she would be the 2025 Wimbledon champion. But that's exactly what happened Saturday, following an impressive fortnight and a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/45724291/iga-swiatek-dominates-amanda-anisimova-win-wimbledon-2025-title\">staggering 6-0, 6-0 victory</a> in the final to win in less than an hour over No. 13 seed <a data-player-guid=\"223cc423-bf69-2077-800f-c38d0d1e79f7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3221\">Amanda Anisimova</a>.</p><p>\"Honestly, I didn't even dream [of this] because for me it was just way too far,\" Swiatek said on court just moments after securing the title. \"I feel like I'm already an experienced player, after winning Slams before, but I never really expected this one.\"</p><p>Swiatek, 24, has now won six Grand Slam titles, and becomes just the eighth woman, and the only active WTA player, to win major titles on all three surfaces. She's also the youngest to do so since <a data-player-guid=\"1ce0271d-9cba-c2c7-1c29-393ef26c6df6\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=187\">Martina Hingis</a> in 2003. She's as surprised as anyone that she was able to do it.</p><hr><p><b>IRONICALLY, SWIATEK'S HIGH POINT</b> as a junior was at Wimbledon, when she won the girls' singles title in 2018.</p><p>It was her only Slam title as a junior, and she had been all but untouchable during her run. But <a href=\"https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2018-07-14/2018-07-14_swiatek_wins_girls_singles_title.html\">even the brief recap</a> on the Wimbledon website after her 6-4, 6-2 triumph in the final stated that \"clay remains her preferred surface.\"</p><p>Sure enough, the clay was where Swiatek initially found the most success as a professional. She reached her first WTA final on the surface and then, as an unseeded 19-year-old and a relative unknown, stunned the tennis world <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/30084335/breakthrough-2020-french-open-title-just-beginning-iga-swiatek\">by claiming the title at the pandemic-delayed 2020 French Open</a>.</p><p>While many were unfamiliar with Swiatek and her game before the tournament, she made quite the impression during her run.</p><p>\"The way she's playing right now, it would be hard to imagine she wouldn't win half a dozen majors,\" seven-time major champion and tennis analyst John McEnroe said after her victory. \"It's incredible.\"</p><p>The clay remained her bread-and-butter, but she also emerged as a strong hard-court player as well. She won her first title on the surface in Adelaide, a 500-level event, just months after her breakthrough in Paris. She recorded a historic 37-match winning streak in the spring of 2022 -- which included the titles at Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart, Rome and the French Open -- and clinched the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in April of that year, following the unexpected retirement of <a data-player-guid=\"6103e730-3773-928b-e612-b3e6fad8ff84\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2031\">Ashleigh Barty</a>. Her winning streak was stopped in the third round of Wimbledon, but she won the US Open by year's end.</p><p>Swiatek held the top ranking for 75 weeks. After failing to defend her US Open title in 2023, she fell to No. 2 briefly, and Sabalenka took No. 1, but she reclaimed it just eight weeks later. The 2024 season was looking to be equally dominant for Swiatek, as she won four of the year's first six 1000-level titles and then was victorious again at the French Open.</p><p>\"She's No. 1. I would say she's really good in every asset of the game,\" Sabalenka said after losing to her in the Italian Open final last year.</p><p>But after hoisting her fifth major trophy, and fourth at Roland Garros, Swiatek struggled, by her standards anyway. The clear favorite for the 2024 Olympics  (held at Roland Garros), Swiatek walked away with the bronze after being upset in the semifinals. She then fell in the quarterfinals at the US Open. She parted ways with her longtime coach Tomasz Wiktorowski and began working with Wim Fissette soon after. Swiatek received a one-month suspension in November <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/42660782/iga-swiatek-accepts-one-month-suspension-doping-case\">after testing positive for a banned substance</a>.</p><p>In that time -- a near eternity for a player of her caliber -- she hadn't won another title. All eyes were on her at the 2025 French Open to see if she could turn things around. When she didn't, her ranking fell to a stunning No. 8.</p><p>It seemed unlikely that Wimbledon and the grass would be much better, as she had never fared well on the surface or at the tournament.</p><p>Grass is the shortest portion of the annual tennis calendar, and for the three previous years, Swiatek had won the French Open, only about three weeks before the start of Wimbledon. That left a very short window to prepare for grass.</p><p>\"I think the toughest transition is [on] the grass,\" Chris Evert, the 18-time major champion and ESPN analyst, said ahead of Wimbledon. \"The clay you've got five weeks [of] tournaments [on] the red clay. You can really get used to playing on clay by the time the French Open comes around, but Wimbledon is really tough, especially for players who do well at the French.\"</p><p>Evert mentioned <a data-player-guid=\"ca44c2b0-9dea-ab40-2541-b50a4442ff8e\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3626\">Coco Gauff</a> as a recent example. The 2025 French Open champion returned to play after a whirlwind media tour for just one warmup tournament in Berlin and lost in her opening match. She then was upset in the first round at Wimbledon.</p><p>In addition to the quick turnaround, clay and grass surfaces are radically different. Even some of the most seasoned veterans struggle in the transition between the two.</p><p>\"Those two surfaces, red clay and grass, are polar opposites, and you need to make a lot of adjustments,\" Evert added. \"The court is different. Your positioning is different. You've got to shorten your strokes. You've got to always be moving into the net if you can. There are just so many things different on the clay that you have to think of and make adjustments.\"</p><p>Prior to this year, Swiatek's best result at Wimbledon had been a quarterfinal appearance in 2023. In her limited grass tournament appearances during that time -- she played in just three main draws outside of Wimbledon since turning professional -- she reached just one semifinal, also in 2023 at Bad Homburg.</p><p>But one year, one tournament, even one match, can change everything. Swiatek had said she was no longer focused on points or her ranking following her French Open exit, and said she would be turning her attention to the grass almost immediately.</p><p>\"Hopefully we're going to have some decent kind of little preseason on grass, because it's always been pretty hard to have that, especially when I want to be a little bit home,\" Swiatek said last month. \"But I don't feel like I need to be home right now, so maybe I'll go somewhere in Europe and practice.\"</p><p>Swiatek returned to competition a little less than three weeks later at Bad Homburg. She advanced to her first-ever grass final behind wins over two-time major champion <a data-player-guid=\"812f6593-cca7-7378-7e10-ea24e932564c\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=421\">Victoria Azarenka</a> in the round of 16 and with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over 2024 Wimbledon finalist <a data-player-guid=\"1cb6cc14-00ad-6c8b-301e-aa8adc243503\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2615\">Jasmine Paolini</a> in the semifinals. She ultimately lost to <a data-player-guid=\"63f9c1e5-14bd-003f-c269-31543931ad1d\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2113\">Jessica Pegula</a> for the title, but arrived to the All England Club with momentum on her side and, as she told reporters the next day, \"a lot of confidence.\"</p><p>But there were far fewer expectations for Swiatek at Wimbledon than at the French Open, and Sabalenka was the overwhelming favorite to win. That all seemed to suit Swiatek.</p><p>While many of her top-ranked peers, including No. 2 Gauff and No. 3 Pegula, fell early in the upset-riddled opening rounds, Swiatek was largely in control and seemed to improve with every match. En route to the final, she dropped just one set (to American Caty McNally, whom she had won the junior French Open doubles title with in 2018) and was propelled by her strong serve, losing only six service games in her first six matches. She routed <a data-player-guid=\"4a64595c-074a-b6e6-1a41-299469b5e1ea\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2183\">Belinda Bencic</a>, 6-2, 6-0, in the semifinals on Thursday.</p><p>\"I just definitely felt like she was completely on fire,\" Bencic later said. \"I will, of course, watch the match again and see also with my team what I could have done differently, but maybe I would have had to play my absolutely best tennis of my life and risk every shot to beat her today the way she played.\"</p><blockquote><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pasta with strawberries 🍓<a href=\"https://twitter.com/iga_swiatek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@iga_swiatek</a>'s favourite meal is an interesting one 😂<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wimbledon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Wimbledon</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FJNdwRBE8x\">pic.twitter.com/FJNdwRBE8x</a></p>— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wimbledon/status/1941538774325899697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p>Along the way, Swiatek seemed to be having fun. She went viral for her pasta-and-strawberries dish and for her affinity for the Wimbledon towels. She was hilariously spotted throughout the tournament hoarding as many as she could after matches, even good-naturedly putting her finger over her lip to the camera as if to keep it a secret when she put one in her bag after her quarterfinal win.</p><p>On Saturday during the final, she had her most dominant performance yet. Swiatek broke Anisimova in the opening game, and there was little doubt the rest of the way. She won the first set in 25 minutes and held Anisimova to just nine points. It was just the third women's major final, and second in the Open era, to feature a 6-0, 6-0 score. It had only previously happened at Wimbledon in 1911.</p><p>When asked by ESPN's Mary Joe Fernandez after the match to explain what she had just achieved, Swiatek said she didn't think she could.</p><blockquote>— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wimbledon/status/1940824844917969368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p>\"I was really competing throughout the whole two weeks,\" Swiatek said. \"No matter what happened before the season, I just trusted the process and the things that my coach wanted me to do on grass. So it was all pretty simple what I wanted to do on the court.</p><p>\"I think I was serving great and I just leaned on that. Had a lot of confidence on every match and, and this happened. So it's all pretty surreal and crazy. I can't explain that, but I'm super happy and I'll enjoy the next days for sure.\"</p><p>Her 35 total games lost throughout the tournament were the fewest by any women's champion at Wimbledon since <a data-player-guid=\"dd77b4c8-665f-6d85-1dd5-339aaafa02a8\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1426\">Martina Navratilova</a> in 1990.</p><hr><p><b>AFTER AN EMOTIONAL</b> hug with Anisimova at the net at the match's conclusion, Swiatek ran over to her box to celebrate with her team. Despite the score and the lopsided contest, Swiatek appeared to be in disbelief. When she was back on the court ahead of the trophy ceremony, she emphatically shook her head when it was placed in her hands as she stared back up at those in the box.</p><p>With the Wimbledon trophy, Swiatek is now just one major title behind <a data-player-guid=\"bb2deb63-4fce-9e10-80e8-e16590139fb3\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=403\">Venus Williams</a> for the most among active players on the WTA Tour. She will now be back up to No. 3 in the latest rankings.</p><p>While she had never been much of a factor at Wimbledon before, Swiatek found a way to win her perhaps unlikeliest of major titles, at perhaps the unlikeliest time in her young career. She still wouldn't call herself a grass-court specialist Saturday and admitted she didn't know what to expect going into the final.</p><p>\"I kind of just wanted to enjoy the moment because with my previous [Wimbledon] results, I wasn't sure if I'm going to have another chance,\" Swiatek told Fernandez. \"I still felt like an underdog and I wanted to really just soak in every minute of being on Centre Court and appreciating already what I did at this tournament, but on the other hand, going for more and being brave.\"</p><p>She may have been under the radar at the tournament, and even slightly unsure of herself, but that won't happen again. Nor will she be discounted at any tournament in the near future. Throughout the fortnight, she left little doubt about her ability and her willingness to adapt and grow as a player, regardless of surface. In doing so, she solidified her status as an all-surface player and reclaimed her status among the game's best. Swiatek is now once again on top of the tennis world.</p><p>Just over five weeks ago, Swiatek left Roland Garros disappointed and dejected. She hadn't won the title. Questions about her future and her recent inability to win titles swirled.</p><p>But on Saturday, as she stood on Centre Court with the admiring eyes of more than 14,000 fans and Catherine, the Princess of Wales, on her, she wondered if it was one of the best things that could have happened to her career. What comes next for Swiatek no one knows, but on Saturday, all felt right for her.</p><p>\"I don't really care what's going to happen,\" Swiatek said about the rest of the season. \"It's hard to compare [this title] to the other Grand Slams, but yeah, I feel like I'm just going to enjoy it and enjoy the way I felt on the court over the past few weeks. There were a lot of people, especially back home, [who] kind of doubted me and not making it easy for me to do my job, and I mean, the expectations and everything.</p><p>\"So I hope I prove to everybody that they should just kind of leave me alone, let me do my work, let me focus on myself, and I'll have great performances as I did today.\"</p>\n</div></div>",

Thinking on the spot, the Barcelona star decided the fairest way to do it was with an improvised draw of sorts.</p><p>She thought of a number between one and 20 and asked the supporters seeking her shirt to guess what it was. After several guesses, someone shouted 11, prompting a nod from Bonmatí and the passing of the jersey. It may or may not have been a coincidence that the recipient also seemed to be the fan with the biggest sign dedicated to Spain's No. 6. -- <em>Marsden</em></p><blockquote data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL_JpvWN-zi/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\"></blockquote>\n<h3>Kika shines bright before Portugal fade away</h3><p><a data-player-guid=\"3883323e-9dd2-3a88-940f-cca2968eb7cb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/320145/kika-nazareth\">Kika Nazareth</a> produced a titanic effort to try and keep <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=9531\">Portugal</a> in the Euros on Friday, only to see her team come up short. Nazareth was not supposed to be here. The Barcelona midfielder had ankle surgery at the end of March and was ruled out for four months. She made a remarkable recovery to feature in the 1-1 draw against Italy on Monday and then produced one of the finals' most incredible, if ultimately unrewarded, displays against Belgium.</p><p>Despite the minutes against Italy being her first since March 12, Nazareth stood head and shoulders ahead of everyone in the Portugal and Belgium match. She led the game in touches (86), completed passes (44), chances created (five), assists (one), recoveries (seven), carries (55), carry distance (360 meters) and attempted take-ons (13), but was powerless as a 2-1 loss sent <em>Os Navegadores</em> home.</p><p>Portugal will be left wondering what could have been if she had been fully fit for the start of the Euros, but also hopeful that progress will not be far away with her leading the team.<em> -- Marsden</em></p><h3>Beever-Jones takes pride as England's tour diarist</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/313088/agnes-beever-jones\">Aggie Beever-Jones</a>' chat with the media on Friday should've been far more hectic than it was.</p><p>Her brave FA chaperone was shielding her from a wasps' nest, but she was calm -- ignoring the buzzing, irritating swarm around her -- as she spoke about life in Zurich with the Lionesses.</p><p>Her game time has been limited so far at the Euros, but she's taking full advantage of the experience. She's learning all she can about life at a major tournament -- hopefully the first of several -- and she's journaling everything as she goes along. She calls it her \"memory book\" and it also combines noting down anything about experiences and lessons with her passion for photography.</p><p>\"I've got quite into photography so I take pictures,\" Beever-Jones says. \"I've got my own little wall chart of each game. It's a book full of all the memories and little details that sometimes you might forget.</p><p>\"Every day we have a wellness [session], and one of the physios writes a quote on the wall. I just always write it down, and try to find the joy in the little things.\"</p><p>She has been appointed the squad's unofficial photographer.

From wearing compression pants to sessions in the ice bath, Morgan's videos offer a real insight into what life is like for elite players at a major tournament.</p><inline3><p>It's also clear to see that, despite failing to progress from their group, the Wales camp are thoroughly enjoying their time in Switzerland. Morgan also noted how -- as well as spending plenty of time with her teammates, enjoying time in the swimming pool and playing Jenga -- the Welsh FA has made sure to schedule plenty of time for the players to spend with their families and take in the local sights.</p><p>With more than 100,000 TikTok followers to her name, Morgan may well have a future in presenting when she decides to hang up her boots. -- <em>Beth Lindop</em></p><hr><h2>Star player of the day</h2><h3>Smilla Holmberg, Sweden</h3><p>Holmberg, in her first start at a European Championship, not only scored but kept <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/286460/klara-buhl\" target=\"_blank\">Klara Bühl</a> at bay, removing one of Germany's biggest attacking threats. Remarkably, it's only her second game for the national team. She earned her first senior call-up for the Euros and made her debut against Denmark earlier in the group stage.

Even a narrow loss to the Netherlands would see them through, unless the Dutch can overturn a daunting three-goal deficit to complicate the head-to-head and goal-difference tiebreakers among the top three sides.

However, a win over France, combined with an England loss or draw, would see them leapfrog the reigning champions and progress at England's expense.</p><p>With both sides desperate to reach the knockout stage, it promises to be a fiery and hard-fought encounter. France might opt to rotate with qualification all but within their grasp, but the margin for error is slim, and with <em>Les Blues </em>having failed to make waves in previous tournaments, it is unlikely they will want to relinquish any comfort they have. -- <em>Keogh</em></p>\n</inline3></div></div>",

ESPN betting expert Ian Parker adds insight and analysis on the card's most intriguing bets.</p><hr><h2>Heavyweight main event</h2><p><img br=\"\" height=\"75px\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0604/espn_din-thomas_.jpg\">Lewis' experience is big in a fight like this. It's been a minute since he fought, but I think he fights better when he's able to take some time to think about how big these fights are. <i>-- Din Thomas</i></p><p><img br=\"\" height=\"75px\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0604/espn_anthony-smith_.jpg\">Tallison is a stud, but he's not supremely tested. Tallison is tall, but Lewis has a weird ability to find the chin of these young, tall guys. Tallison is probably going to want to wrestle, but I feel like Derrick is actually really good at this anti-wrestling thing. <i>-- Anthony Smith</i></p><h3>Betting analysis</h3><p><i>Odds accurate as of July 10. For the most up-to-date odds, <a href=\"https://espnbet.app.link/FLasedQ1RUb\">visit ESPN BET</a>.</i></p><p><b>Parker: Tallison to win (+225).</b> Lewis, a fan favorite, is coming off a win last spring but has quite the tough challenge in front of him in the 25-year-old Teixeira. Lewis has more than 10 years of UFC experience and many multi-round bouts on his side, whereas Teixeira hasn't seen the second round in his eight-fight professional career. Will that matter? In the past, Lewis has packed it in and taken losses when he hasn't been able to tire out opponents quickly, and unfortunately for him, I see him on the wrong side of a knockout punch in this one. Teixeira is an exciting prospect and potentially a future UFC heavyweight contender. Either take his moneyline in your parlay or take him to win inside the distance.</p><hr><h2>Parker's best bets on the rest of the card</h2><h3>Welterweight: <a data-player-guid=\"e09357d0-cd89-0616-198c-8af27ab0b51c\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2615077/stephen-thompson\">Stephen Thompson</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"bc4dd947-2a45-3822-9754-5efa198d716c\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4921516/gabriel-bonfim\">Gabriel Bonfim</a></h3><p><b>Bonfim to win inside the distance.</b> After consecutive losses by finish in December 2023 and October 2024, Thompson takes on another up-and-coming finisher in Bonfim. On the feet, Thompson's distance striking and lateral movement will help him avoid the power of Bonfim, but for how long? At some point, Bonfim will get Thompson to the ground and implement his world-class jiu-jitsu. \"Wonderboy,\" a 13-year UFC veteran with losses in four of his past five fights, deserves credit for taking this fight at this point in his career, but Bonfim is a bad matchup for him. I expect Bonfim to shine brightly.</p><h3>Featherweight: <a data-player-guid=\"99fadd98-2972-1aab-0719-7ddb89ca9309\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3164030/calvin-kattar\">Calvin Kattar</a> vs. <a data-player-guid=\"f09000cb-5b3b-5070-e9df-24150b521222\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3023804/steve-garcia\">Steve Garcia</a></h3><p><b>Garcia to win (-125).</b> Garcia, riding a streak of five straight wins by finish, will be looking to add Kattar to his résumé. Garcia is a tough out for anyone because of his knockout power and durability to match. He also can use his underrated ground game if needed. Kattar is a good fighter, but he has lost four in a row. Unless he can tire out Garcia with a wrestling game that he rarely uses, I don't see a path to victory for Kattar. Look for Garcia to continue his impressive run.</p><h3>Light heavyweight: <a data-player-guid=\"2d40db13-e269-35f1-afb5-bb3b01638b93\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/5122234/junior-tafa\">Junior Tafa</a> vs <a data-player-guid=\"0ee66470-4275-327e-80ed-8de348278000\" href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4410698/tuco-tokkos\">Tuco Tokkos</a></h3><p><b>Tafa to win (-175).</b> Plain and simple: If Tokkos cannot take down Tafa and hold him down for 15 minutes, Tokkos will get knocked out. Tokkos has lost his past two fights, and though Tafa is new to the light heavyweight division, he has knockout power that lasts an entire fight. Expect Tafa to come out of the gate looking for the finish, and I think he'll get it.</p>\n</div></div>",
